Specifically I've noticed wellbutrin XL, cymbalta, parnate and nardil all made me have suicidal thoughts eventually and major major depression.  The severity was in order (worst to ""best""): Cymbalta, wellbutrin, parnate, nardil.

I'm sensitive to norepinephrine obviously.  Doesn't this mean I'm bipolar or at least mixed state or agitated depressed.  ATM I'm diagnosed as MDD and panic.  I want to try lithium or saphris or geodon.  

Only meds that have worked for me so far have been Zoloft (really good except kills my motivation and interest), and remeron (great but I sleep all the time).",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I consider myself fortunate every day for being an Australian citizen and having access to the healthcare in my country.  Hell yeah do I bitch about it, it's frustrating and demeaning and terrifying.  However, whenever I feel that way I think about how lucky I am and all the opportunities available to me.

I was hospitalised on August 2nd this year, for the very first time.  I spent 19 days in inpatient care on an open ward.  I attended groups that made me want to tear my hair out, had to share a room with an incredibly scary woman who insisted on having the door to the hallway open and the lights on all night... and my goodness did she snore!

I was started on Seroquel and Lithium and they dropped my antidepressant a smidge.  After 4 days on Lithium I felt like I was seeing clearly for the first time in more than 5 years.  I turned 23 in September and have been living with my mum and step dad since about 5 weeks before my hospitalisation.

I was hospitalised after an episode of downing a bottle of wine or so and a few too many codeine and getting in my car.  I could have killed somebody.  I barely remember the drive.

Coming out of hospital there were no out of pocket costs, and no I do not have insurance.  My GP is happy to sign me as incapacitated temporarily so that I can claim unemployment benefits.  My mum pays for my psychologist who I try to see every week.

I have a mental health nurse that visits me every fortnight at my home and she helps monitor my mood and reactions to medications so she can report back to the psychiatrist for me.

I have problems with self-esteem, anxiety and especially social phobia.  I went from having a great job that consumed me and had me always paranoid I was about to be fired, to living at home with my mother.

The doctors told me to write off the rest of 2013, it looks like 2014 is definitely in the mix now as well.  I get frustrated every single day about losing my independence and how on earth I'm ever going to be able to afford to live alone.  I might go back to university next year, I might complete one of the three degrees I've start, I might change to a different university for a different degree because I hate all mine, or I may move to the other side of the country.

My medications are affordable, I can see a doctor when I need to, I can be admitted to a public hospital and not be burdened with debt.  I can study part time or full time, I can work if I want to, I have help from a range of resources for when I go back to uni.

I was diagnosed as Bipolar NOS, ultra-rapid cycling.  They aren't sure if I'm BPI or BPII.  My most common state this year has been mixed, and terrifying.  I have no idea what normal feels like.
I currently take 100mg Zoloft and 50mg Seroquel in the morning.
I currently take 1000mg Lithium and 300mg Seroquel at night.

I experience vivid dreams that leave me exhausted.  I have no contact with the outside world.  I've put on weight that I'm trying to lose healthily (history of eating disorder).

I have hope that I can become a better version of me, because you guys are doing it and have done it and have succeeded.

I lurk a lot and I read a lot.

Thanks for being there xx",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

As the title of my post says, I am seeing a psychiatrist for the first time ever tomorrow. I have been in regular weekly CBT therapy for the last year, but so far have never been professionally evaluated by a psychiatrist. After a year of therapy, my therapist has advised me to see this doctor to explore potential for medication to assist with suspected BPII. 

I've never been diagnosed formally; I've always known I had ""anxiety"" and ""panic attacks"" and ""depression"" and ""OCD habits"", etc, but I've never been able to put a diagnosis to it all. I've always known I was different, but I have never gotten an actual, tangible diagnosis before.

My therapist told me that this pdoc will want an overview of my symptoms and that from there we will discuss medications (if warranted; and I think they are warranted), and then he'll prescribe some meds. She said I will only see him once, I will not see him for CBT therapy or anything, simply for medication and to check in on how medication is progressing.

What should I expect? Will I have to take a psych inventory? Is this considered a ""formal psychiatric evaluation""? Will I walk out of there with a piece of paper and my DSM codes for diagnosis? How can I make sure the pdoc understands everything with the limited time I have to explain things? As I'm sure a lot of you know, it's not as easy as a few sentences to sum up all of your issues.

I'm scared; I'm finally going to find out ""what's wrong with me"". Consciously I am telling myself that I am not worried about it, but deep down I know that this is going to be hard to face hearing what I truly am. I haven't had a panic attack since last fall; I had two last week. I think this is affecting me more than I realize.

Any advice, words of encouragement, or info is much appreciated. ","['nsubj', 'dobj', 'dobj']",1,neu_vader

I get like that too, though it lasts longer than weeks, usually more like  months. I tend to put a lot of myself into whatever it is, then suddenly I start to realize I just don't care anymore, and it never comes back. And quite frankly it scares me. I want to stick with something for once.

I'm Bipolar, diagnosed, on meds, etc. I've found the correct dosage, and I've been doing absolutely great.

And for some reason, I thought this was going to make my relationship better. He blamed absolutely everything on me being just like my mother and excused all of his behavior on this and my disorder. 

His family has a long history of abuse, and at first, I didn't think he would be like that. We've been together for 2 1/2 years with on and off due to indiscretions. He's cheated on me a couple times, also blamed on me being never happy and basically crazy. He's emotionally abusive as in he makes me think I'm always in the wrong, I'm always at fault, it's just my disorder acting up.

So, when I finally found my correct dosage, I thought it would fix things. We've gotten into physical altercations every once in a while. I would lash out physical, and he would violently hold me down and find every way to basically hurt me without ""technically"" hitting me. In example, grabbing me, slamming me around, jamming elbows, chins, knees into my body. He's pushed and bit me a few times, but that's it.

So, this is why I don't understand why the medication didn't help this. If it's been all my fault all this time, why didn't it fix anything? I've been completely great in my life: more productive, extremely stable, etc., but it seems to have skipped over this. And I have been so convinced it was me. 

Tonight, he told me it wasn't working, I was crazy as ever, etc., etc. because he showed up at my house after a deal I would help with homework if he came over, but he showed up high. After requesting food, he fell asleep less than an hour later with no homework finished and not understanding why I didn't want to deal with him.

I thought I could make up for my anger with waking him up in a sexual way. This didn't work. He was extremely uninterested and annoyed I woke him up at all. And all I asked for him to stay in my life was basically promise to be more emotionally there. After that, it went downhill as I told him it was not okay to show up at my house high, expect me to do homework, provide him food, show absolutely no gratefulness and then get angry when I try doing something for him.

Apparently this was me being crazy even though I never raised my voice. Suddenly I was bullshitting and delusional and just a liar. He came there to sleep, that was all. I even told him to read the text and he wouldn't, I was just making it up. 

Then it escalated. I told him to leave, he wouldn't, so I tried taking my pillow from him, which I actually thought would lighten the mood. Instead, he grabbed my wrists so hard, it was sure to leave bruises. I had a few tears in my eyes, but I was determined to grab my pillow. When he continued to grind his hands and chin into my hands/wrists, I finally broke. I punched him multiple times, and bit and scratched when he was slamming my hands into the wall.

This was all me. I started this. I was crazy. How dare I hit him. He didn't hurt me at all. I shouldn't have grabbed the pillow. If I didn't start anything, I wouldn't have been hurt. Over, and over, it was my fault.

I told him to leave again, and he wouldn't. This went on for hours until it happened once again. I wanted him out, so I tried pushing him off the bed. At this point, he promised to leave tomorrow and never come back (something he threatened often and usually left me extremely upset). He then slammed my wrists against the wall and crushed my hand against it just enough to hurt like hell, but nothing to break. I got angrier and when he grabbed me again, I bit him extremely hard and told him if he was never coming back, he had to leave right then and now. There was no reason for him to share something so personal as a bed if he was leaving and if he was going to be abusive (at this point, I said just like his father as well, who's an alcoholic and abusive). He said he was going no where, etc., etc., I was proving who I was. 

This was right before I bit him. When I did, he began punching my arm repeatedly. When I told him right then and there I was calling the police, he stole not only my phone, but computer by force. He told me he was calling my psychiatrist and they'd put me away for being crazy. I told him the only one they'd put away was him.

This whole night he basically let out how much everything was my fault, and I don't deserve apologies for anything he does. Even though I even said it was both our faults and it takes two to tango, etc., etc. 

I don't know what to do. It hurts to think about living without him, but at this point, I know it would be for the better. Nothing has been fixed and it's only got worse and I'm seriously worry if I stay, the little episode tonight will be the least of my problems.

I just need some assurance it isn't the bipolar. If I've been great outside of this, then it can't just be me being crazy? Not everything I do is just me being crazy and bipolar, right? If I'm productive and happy and finally stable, the medication has to be working... It's not me, at least completely, being the problem.

#1.

I am doing alright myself. I am looking for jobs and have some leads.
Finished a degree at long last (mid twenties). Finally, know that I am artistic and about the ADHD.
 
Psychologically and personality wise I understand myself and others much better than ever (which is good, because I am in Marketing, etc).


#2.
I went to the sexual health clinic recently. To get tested after a somewhat risky encounter. 

It was already a scary event. I was nervous, had 4 shots in the am. And described some ADHD and what is going on to the testing nurse. 
-Pretty clean in drinking, despite 12 or so shots vodka that day. Can quit again very quickly. 

The nurse must have spoken to the female doctor. 

*Interestingly,
She asked if perhaps...[I am Bipolar?] She said ""I am worried about you."" Not due to test results, but [Mental health wise]. 

-Not the only doctor to ask Anxiety or BP or commenting on ""instability"". 


-She asked bc of many days no sleep, energy, stuff about crashes, and the like.

-I explained a bit about ADHD. Thinking no...

-Got to thinking...
-R. Barkley and others say there is a 1-way link --- BP people often have ADHD.
-I like stimulants (all) because I ""FEEL"" like I can get things done.
-Much like my anxiety was about performance -- fear of failure, success, money... my self - medicating and actual medicating, SEEMS better, if it is for ""productive reasons"".

#3.

I feel very good, kind of crazy, and ""HIGH"" when I don't sleep, at times. 
Esp when I am somehow, haphazardly doing well. 

-I honestly think I'm doing better.
-I think I am manic at times and have been for yrs. 
-I think each of the prev. two statements are true. My beliefs, feelings, change INSTANTLY.
-[I like her. She's different. It won't work. No one can be trusted. Screw everyone.] for instance. 

-Had my life ruined SEVERAL times.
-with horrid anxiety, fear of failure.
-MAJOR errors in judgement made while treating ""Generalized anx disorder w / anxiety attacks (no fainting tho)."" Had spiralling, downward negative thoughts.
-16 - 24 or so most of life negative. 
-Anxious or major depression, bad decisions, untreated ADHD and such. 
-Bad side effects from an SNRI that made me MANIC I am pretty sure. 
-But long off that. I don't let people use me anymore. 


#4.
I understand people much better now.
Psyche wise, attraction wise, relating wise... even my astrology. I fit many descriptors of Pisces. I think this is all good for marketing anyways. 

Acc to the MAYO CLINIC website --- for Mania phase, all symptoms listed, I have had at some point. 
-I can definitely see why some think I am ""crazy"" and why some think ""Bipolar"". 
-I do think, write, and speak (at times)  -RAPID FIRE. 


-I am medicating ADHD right now. Thought this was right. 
-Don't want to ask Pyschiatrist... only meds are the answer for many mental health things --- acc to the industry. 
-My Psychologist says maybe episodes of mania... I will get tested. 
-They have never seen me ""down""/ ""depressed"", but know I have been. 

-Hard to find good doctors. Keep things compartmentalized.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
-TL;DR:

-People see me as eccentric or worse at times. I know this. 
-People don't understand anyways, so who cares? 
-Yet, maybe I am harming myself treating ADHD, not BPD?

-Things that could have gotten me killed via (others), via sub abuse, via random interactions, via bad judgment.
-Sometimes risk taking, sometimes... I just could not help it... impulsively, or it didn't start out like that, just got out of control. 
-Do not want to be an ""accident waiting to happen."" (to my well being I mean. I don't want to ruin my life). 
-I fell ""HIGH"" when getting things done haphazard, last minute, sometimes intoxicated, with no sleep, and little preperation. 
 (essays, presentations, exams, dates, something hard... improvising it is fun). Fun, but all that seems possible and is actually
quite stressful. My life was in limbo, so I got used to that. But, I am sure I could do better now if I chose the right programs and support for say grad school, and the like. I need to do what really intrigues me. Otherwise I can't stay motivated and focused and just become further lost. 

Doctors and others say all kinds of things about me. But the last one said:
""I'm worried about you. You may be bipolar. You need to take care of your health - Physical and Mental. And it made me think. She definitely comes into contact with patients, having major mental illnesses more often than say a family doctor.

Stopped smoking when I started seroquel, but felt like a major zombie a lot of the time. When I finally smoked again, for some reason, the seroquel was neutralized, and I realized how bad it was affecting me. I cold turkey'd it that moment. After a couple days of hell, I was fine, and I got Lamictal from my pdoc.

So, I have been taking that for a while (over a year), and I thought everything was okay, except for the fact that I've become... dumber. The usual side effect of that fairly benign drug. I still smoke, but it doesn't interact with the Lamictal.

Lately, I had been feeling extremely disaffected- emotionally detached, and kind of going through life on autopilot. I knew something was up, but I didn't care enough to change anything. Additionally, time was a goddamn blur.

Until another substance nuked the Lamictal. A research chemical. 2C-B. After a fairly awesome time on that, I snapped right the hell out of it. Kind of freaked me out. The numbness I had felt up until then was particularly unsettling- the novelty I experienced was in itself novel. It was as if I had regained my sense of wonder.

So, I'm thinking I will reduce my Lamictal and Cannabis intake. So far, so good- a little edgy, but definitely not hypo or depressed. I'll probably ease down to 50mg, and smoke a bit less, but I'm good about taking a mood inventory at regular intervals. 

I have no qualms about modifying my brain chemistry with substances, so this isn't a ""OMG MEDS ARE EVIL"" post. If things start to go south, I'll titrate back up. I've been thankful for the stability, but I think a lot of my issues had to do with a rather unhealthy relationship I was in at the time. 

Just wanted to ask if anyone has similar experiences like this, or advice. I mean, feel free to give me the usual Psychedelics/Don't go off meds lecture, but I'm not stupid.

Agrophobia, Social Phobia, ADHD, dysthemia, depression, general anxiety, PTSD

Medications I've tried and didn't work: Webultrin XL, Effexor, Fluoxetine (Prozac), Atarax, Ambien, Sonata, trazadone, benedryl.
Most of these had the side of effect of making twice as irritable and hostile. I even tried to kill my dog, and my fiance while on Effexor. Atarax makes me twice as anxious and the sleep meds just made me groggy and not fall asleep.

What I am on right now: Adderall XR 20mg, Lunesta 2mg (PRN)

(Main Post) Sorry about the above but because it's my first time posting I figured you might need a little medical background, maybe.

So I see my Psych MD at my local Mental Health Dept. tomorrow, but I don't know what to tell her. It's like the minute I sit in that chair and they start doing the DSM thing and asking me for examples I freeze up.

I started writing things down (I was given a handbook ob bipolar and the criteria by my therapist) in regards to points in the book but there are so many things that even with a web search I don't understand what it means.

So I'm going to ask you guys for a little help so I know if I experience this or not here is goes.

* Pressured Speech - Making grandiose gestures or wordplay: singing.
    My example would be that I cannot for the life of me talk without using my hands. Like hands all over the place making big gestures, and I sing stupid songs all the time. I can literally look at anything in a room and just make a song and sing it as loud and annoying as humanly possible to purposely annoy people, or (which happens more often) I **have to** or I am anxious, if get extremely anxious if I don't do that hands thing as well.

* Being prone to monologues outside awareness &lt;- what the hell does that even mean? I have a constant inner monologue that I can't stop and it literally disrupts what I am doing. If I inner monologue while driving I forget I am in the car and have almost gotten into accidents because of ""daydreaming"" which is what is basically is for me.

* Risky behavior - okay I don't do drugs or have promiscuous sex because I am in a relationship, and I have social anxiety and that goes outside my comfort zone, but I know for a fact (because I haven't always had SA) that I would cheat on my fiance, I think about it all the time. I have smoked pot behind his back, and he is so against that, but it was once and I had a panic attack thinking he would leave me, so I never did it again. I do often spend tons of money. I dropped $1000+ on comics in September. Best part I didn't have $1000 to spend. I maxed out my credit card. I do speed when I drive, a lot, I've never ever been pulled over and I often have a feeling of invincibility (i.e. I'll never get caught speeding). Any time I drink alcohol I over drink, and get so drunk its hard to tell if I should be taken to the hospital for alcohol poisoning or if I am not as drunk as I think I am, I force myself to throw up so I'm not drunk anymore (which actually doesn't work, that all in my head).

* Behavioral symptoms - changing appearance, dress, makeup to appear more attractive/flamboyant - I don't think I consciously do this to be more attractive, but I literally scrapped my whole wardrobe two years ago to be Sweet Lolita, then again to be ""normal"", then again in September to wear all Deadpool stuff. Like I literally have 13 DP tee's that I have an order to wearing so I wear them all for an equal time.
My new thing is that I absolutely **need** to get my hair cut and colored, I'm having anxiety because it's been almost a year since I change my physical appearance and not just my clothes. I also **need** a tattoo.  I'm having anxiety because I don't have these things, I need to do these things NOW, not later, not a week from now, not a month from now, NOW. I don't have the money but I'm going to spend it anyways so, yeah...

Last one I swear.

* Congitive Symptoms - altered perceptions of smell, hearing, and vision - I often don't hear people correctly, I'd say at least 1/3 of the time, I'll be like ""What, the refrigerator is bouncing on a trampoline, that doesn't make sense."" - ""That isn't even close to what I said, where you even listening?"" I genuinely think that is what they said, like all the time, every single day, this happens at least once to 10 times. I don't know if this is part of the distractability or not.

So I'm **not** trying to self diagnose, I wanted to repeat that just in case. I just really want to make sure I understand these things before I go into see my MD and shes like no this is what that is, do you have an example, and me being like ""Er Duh, nope!"" cause if someone asks me something on the spot its like my brain fly's out the window. So I'd rather be prepared with examples and her say no that doesn't really fit, then not have an example at all and her have nothing to go on besides me saying Yes I do that, but I can't tell you an example or how often. Because anyone can say yeah I do that.

Even without these few points I (too me and my fiance) fit most the criteria. More than enough already to be diagnosed, but I want to make sure I understand everything fully before I go into the office blind.

So any corrections or help is fully appreciated :)
If BP gets ruled out we will be looking into more severe depressive mood disorders to this is more of a **rule out stage.**

I was in denial with my therapist, who mentioned it a few times to me, for a long time, because I refused to believe I had it. My father had it, and seeing how he was with his bipolar that went undiagnosed terrifies me. Anyways, I finally have the correct diagnoses. But... I've refused to go on the bipolar medications.

I have a really sensitive body, so it takes way more medications than usual to find the right one. Combine that with other medications I need to take... it's scary. I also have an issue with weight, and saw that most bipolar medications make you gain it, which makes me not want to take it even more...

I just know I need something though. These episodes are just so bad. And I hate having it happen and in the back of my mind feel like I know I shouldn't be getting this angry or upset but being unable to stop or control it. 

I don't even know where I'm going with this anymore. I'm really terrified of myself and this stupid disorder and label. 

Also, has anyone talked to their doctor about ways to counteract the weight gain with the meds? Was it worth it for you?

Up until now I have made every effort to be completely honest with her (which is *very* difficult for me in real life-my go-to phrase has always been ""I'm fine"", lol. But, no, really). Now I am not sure if I even want to/will be able to continue seeing her.

A month or so ago, I drove to my appointment (weekly), sat in the waiting room, and waited. And waited. Until, 20 minutes later, I got up and went home. I was having a really shitty week, which didn't help. I ended up crying the entire way home, wondering what the fuck and how I couldn't even *pay* to have someone listen to my whiny ass bullshit. 
She called up later and apologized, saying she had been sick and overslept and was extremely sorry. Of course I said it was no big deal, no problem, etc.  Even though, it did make me feel paranoid, weird, and all around bad. 

Well, I talked myself out of it, chalked it up to my bp making me paranoid and weird and commanded my brain to let it go, ffs. Which I (for the most part, I thought)did. Except since then, every damn time I go to the appointment and am waiting, I start to panic inside. And it has only gotten worse.

A couple weeks later, I wrote the appointment down wrong, and showed up a day early. And felt like a tool. And left. I mean, I know that this medication is making me forgetful and stupid, but I still felt like a dumbass.

So after *that*, I feel even *more* anxiety and panic-followed-by-feeling-like-an-idiot every time I go to an appointment. However, I'm able to choke it down. Pretty much. Last week I told her that I didn't think these sessions were doing much except to reinforce my narcissistic introspection. Yes, (as anyone that read previous posts) it was another bad week. Hide-in-the-bedroom-all-week bad. Then my husband was away for a couple of days, forcing me to come out of hiding, the sun came out, and I felt re-energized! I spent the time doing super cleaning, inside and out. Was feeling pretty good. Which was lucky.

Which brings me to this week's appointment. 

I went, sat in the waiting room, quelled the feelings of anxiety, and waited. For 20 minutes. And drove home. Hm, did I fuck up the date/time *again*?
 On the way home, she calls and tells me she must have just missed me and apologized again. Said she didn't have her client phone numbers with her at home. (Which she had said the previous time she didn't show up.) The excuse was the same, that she was sick with a bad cold, etc.

The trouble is, I think she a)just spaced my appointment off because I bore the fuck out of her and it was a nice day and she really just wanted to enjoy it (it was pretty awesome), or b)I am just a boring, whinging patient and she had a hangover or something.

Either way, now I'm feeling pretty conflicted about this situation. I just cannot for the life of me go in and tell her ""I think you lied to me about being sick."" But if I don't, then I'm no longer being honest. And if I'm no longer able to be honest with my psychologist then wtf is the point? Also, if I stop seeing her, I can pretty much guarantee that I will not seek out someone else. I'll be meeting with my 'medicator' in a couple days, and will request an antidepressant to supplement my current med and hope for the best. 
 It is just way too difficult for me to open up to anyone at the best of times, and it takes all of my willpower to just show up once a week anyway. I hate talking about my so called 'problems', and it just makes me feel like a whiny, self absorbed idiot. Really, I am sick of hearing myself talk about myself being myself being a goddamn maundering asshat. Fuck. 

On the other hand, I am afraid I might start to completely unravel and not sure what would be waiting for me at the end of that particular ball of yarn. 

I just don't know what to do.

This isn't just a one time thing; it happens every time I go see him. 
Whilst talking to him he just stares at me with a lost look on his face. I have to explain at least 3-4 times how meds are effecting me or certain situations etc... Even then the lost look comes across his face. When asking a question I get about 2-3 different answers, this time a confused look and a very vague answer is lost in his muttering. Oh, and I have been told to ""Google my question""  I asked if possibly my prognosis/disagnosi is still the same or if he changed anything, just you know, curious.  He had to ask me what I ""am."" He does not seem to click with me emotionally or seem to care. 

As Hermione Granger would say, ""he has the emotional range of a teaspoon"" 

Okay so here's the bigger problem.... As soon as I left his office I decided I had had enough. I called the office (extreme fear of calling offices and the like) to see about changing to a new doctor. I got a rather tiring runaround and after being transferred 4 times I was told that I am not ALLOWED to just switch doctors... I have to consult with my case manager, have my reasons for wanting to switch written up all pretty like, and then it has to be reviewed by someone else, and if and only if it's approved can I get a new doctor. I had to leave a message with my case manager and am waiting for her return call.

My question is has anyone ever dealt with this situation/process and of so, how did it turn out? What did you say as your reasons for switching? How were you treated? Was it a long drawn out process? Are you satisfied and receiving better care? 

I've written the situation out because I am want to make sure I word it correctly and don't want my case manager to think that I am doctor hopping.  ",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I'm type 2 apparently,  but still not 100% convinced. That's kinda to be expected though, right? Wish I could get some relief. Wish I could just get a confirmation that I've got something right. I don't mean ""right"" in the righteous since either, but rather, I've got something right in that it will lead to me being truly happier. 

I convince myself of things from time to time, but it always ends up back with me being indecisive.  

I know I can't ask for diagnosis here and my psychiatrist (The first one to say Bipolar) is a very intelligent person who's been in the business a long time. I'm just still so frustrated by my... INability. I feel like I can't even try fully in life on ANYTHING because I can't decide if it's worth the time/effort/money/insert anything here.

I'm trying Lamictal and Abilify right now, so far with positive(?) effects but not nearly enough? I'm on 200/2 mgs respectively.

In the past, I've tried about 5 different SSRIs, all of which made me tired or suicidal. I've tried a couple antipsychotics which have made me a zombie. I tried wellbutrin and some stimulants, some of which made me go CRAZY with anxiety. 

In the past, I've thought my problems were just anxiety, just OCD, just depression, just blah blah blah. I've thought that it's probably just that I care a lot about my life and want to make sure I'm doing it right. Maybe that's why I'm not convinced it's bipolar type 2, even though it makes a hell of a lot of sense.

Can someone give me a few words? What can I do to help me make up my mind more? How do I stop being obsessed with possibility?

Are medications my only hope? I'm OK with it if they are, but I want to take the rights to make it so I don't say ""I want to be SURE I take the right ones"". 

Also: I have to explain things in excessive detail sometimes to make sure people understand me. I have some mild-moderate OCD tendencies like touching my throat/washing my hands a decent amount. Don't know if any of that matters.

I feel a darkness that is constantly enshrouding me day and night for which I cannot escape.  I can't sleep at night with the racing thoughts but by day, I just want to sleep (if I can) to hide from everything; I can't deal with ""anyone"".  I feel absolutely paralyzed by the depression.  The hypomania episodes are very few and far in between.  I'd personally rather have them than this deep debilitating depression.  My hypomania mainly consists of feeling over productive, but that's the extent of it.  

I was diagnosed BP2 in the last 9 years after being treated for depression and anxiety for many years prior; something I heard is quite common.  

I've taken nearly the whole gamut of drugs for depression, anxiety, mood stabilizers and whatnot without much success.  I'm considered treatment resistent with drugs so I'm not taking anything now other than the Klonopin, as need for anxiety. The last medication I was on a couple of years ago was Lamictal and Klonopin for anxiety as needed.  The higher the Pdoc titrated the Lamictal dosage, the more my short-term memory was obliterated to the point where if anyone spoke to me, seconds later I could not remember what was said; this made me absolutely beyond frustrated since I rely quite heavily on my photographic and working memory which was essentially wiped out by the Lamictal.  This never improved so the dosage would be backed off until I'd adjust a little and slowly titrated upwards.  However I never was able to reach the therapeutic dosage levels, rather only 50% of the prescribed amount. 

Anyhow, I've been tossed out of the psych medical system because I'm told since I'm not able to take meds, they can't continue to treat me.  WTF!  

I feel so lost and it feels significantly worse that my SO's is helplessly watching me fade into oblivion over the years. I'm a shell of a person. I can't eat much... sometimes I wish I could turn to substances to numb myself, but I know it'll just complicate matters so I never have bothered. Gawd, I hate being rational!  

My SO been with me for 5 years and he's the best thing a girl could ask for, but it's so unfair of me to make him suffer along with me and to make him feel so alone.  I don't even know what to do.  I just don't see any point to anything anymore, but I can't quit ""life"" either because I don't want to hurt those I love more.  

Where does one go from here? I can't take meds, I'm without psych support, I'm not one who does well in group therapy because when I'm listening to other peoples problems it makes me feel even worse then I end up crashing emotionally.  I won't talk to friends because they won't understand or think it's something that'll pass so I'm isolating from everyone including the one person who loves me.

I'm on Depakote ER, 1500MG a night. The problem is that although I think my medication is working, I'm not *completely* sure. **Processing emotions like a normal person is still entirely new to me as well, so I need some outside input.**

**BIPOLAR RELATED:**

* I haven't had a single episode since I started my medication, so that's already a good start.
* I feel like my brain has enough time to think about what someone is saying, and rationally understand and perceive them. It's giving me a ""ceiling"" for my emotions, which is something I've never felt, so this is a good sign.
* i can't tell if I'm still feeling hypomanic sometimes or not. Often I will be awake for hours at night in bed, but I'm not sure if that could be my anxiety (see below). I'm also generally a happy and excited, ""go get em"" type person, so this makes it even more complicated.
* I *want* the medicine to work, badly, so I'm afraid of that clouding my judgement.

**THINGS I THINK ARE ANXIETY RELATED:**

* Feel like everyone is constantly watching me in public.
* I feel incredibly awkward in certain situations (like waiting in a bathroom for the sink). My head doesn't stop thinking, I have to tell myself to breath, feel incredibly judged.
* I tear my nails apart all the time or bite my lips until they bleed.
* I rarely leave my house, even for meeting friends.
* I worry for hours sometimes each night (still), my dreams are usually nightmares/stressful situations. (Again, this could be hypomania, but I'm not sure.)
* I am constantly feeling an impending sense of doom, especially when I leave my house (I'm always afraid of getting shot in the head by some random driver, and that the killer will never be brought to justice).
* It's pretty damn difficult to focus on anything.

Endless fatigue, feelings of hopelessness, going from an honors student to missing so many classes and assignments that I barely graduated. Then when college started, I began to have off and on periods of hypo-mania. I switched majors so many times, they would seem appealing to me for a short period of time and I would get really excited, applying for as many internships as possible and then lose interest really fast. I dropped out of school 3 times ""to figure things out"", the 3rd being the most recent and permanent. I guess figuring things out means working food service industry to get by and going out drinking every night.
Last summer I was hospitalized during a mixed episode and put on an anti-depressant (Effexor). I became sober and tried to get on track to stabilize myself. The medication really fucked me up, my psychiatrist would not listen to my concerns, I finally stopped cold turkey back in January. 
The side effects of the withdrawal has worn off, and I'm now on Lamictal after being diagnosed with bipolar II from a new psychiatrist.

I started massage therapy school in March, but again dropped out (partly out of fear of getting halfway in and losing interest and more money, partly because I realized if I'm in an episode my anxiety and irritability would me not to want to touch anyone) To be quite honest I have no clue what I want in life, or what I enjoy. For me, my hypo-mania manifests as irritability, rarely a pleasurable experience.

I also feel that most of the medications and so much therapy isn't working.  I just swing right back into this dark and damaging thought patterns.  I'm a high functioning person, and doing well, but it seems these deeper psychotic issues are boiling up more and more.

I made an appointment with my doctor who is very good and understanding to talk a bit more.  I wanted to go over some of my symptoms and things and maybe you guys can help me out?

I can't sleep no matter what I take, and I also manage to be able to function on next to nothing.  

I go on insane exercise bouts, and I'm talking biking for an entire day in 95 degree humidity.  Once I being I can't stop. Ill stay out until midnight sometimes.

Ill either work for 2 hours and want to go home or work for 18 hours straight.  At times my boss has come in when I've been leaving.

Ill treat my girlfriend who I love like a queen one day, and another day ill want to meet other women and that's all ill think about.

I start to feel overly confident, and I start to basically build all these crazy plans and ideas but I never full execute them.  Ill draw out pages and pages of diagrams and ideas.

I have to try every hard to not interrupt people when talking.. Very hard.  This is my trademark amongst friends.

I feel worthless despite having accomplished a lot 

mainly I'm paranoid about a lot of things happening to me.  

I'm starting to not give a shit about hanging with friends but I feel real guilty if I don't.

Most of these swings vary. Some take days to develop and some even longer and persist for different times.

I understand if I step back and look at this list a lot of people feel like this.  I just feel that the meds and therapy now isn't working and I've tried so many.  I'm at the point where I'm wondering if I can ever balance myself out.

I’m twenty four, female, and have been living abroad in Germany for over a year now. I was diagnosed around six years ago with Bipolar II, rapid cycling and mixed episodes, and I was previously misdiagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder ten years ago. During the time before my current diagnosis, I was medicated and went to weekly talk therapy, and I saw very little positive results from that. When I told my mom and my therapists that I didn’t feel like the meds were working, I was kind of brushed off, so I have some trust issues and feelings that medication won’t work for me or will do more harm than good. For that reason, I’ve remained unmedicated and haven’t seen a therapist for years. And for a while, it was okay. I think I’ve done a pretty good job of managing myself in the past. I am currently in school, have always held down a full-time job, and managed to move pretty far from home and set up a life here. I have a lot of friends, and despite everything, I have a lot to be proud of and happy about. 

But in the past few months, I’ve been struggling in a way that I never had before. I’ve faced minor challenges with school and work, and sometimes episodes suck, sure. But this is the first time that I’ve felt so unstable. I’m really backsliding against all of the progress that I’ve worked hard to make. I’ve been making a lot of really risky and reckless choices, and while I can think pretty rationally about them later, I’m finding it pretty impossible to be smart in the moment. So a lot of things that I did occasionally before and with few repercussions are now happening with nauseating frequency. I’ve been having a lot of really casual sex with strangers, friends, people I don’t even know the names of, people who I might not even *like*. I’ve starting drinking excessively to the point of blacking out, which is something that I never did before. Last night, I’m pretty sure I got kicked out of a bar after I got into an argument with some guy about who knows what and tried to get physical. I’m spending a lot more than I’m making, not paying rent and hiding from my roommates to avoid telling them that I don’t have enough to pay my share, and shoplifting when I don’t have the money to pay anymore. Last month I got caught shoplifting, and I am still unsure if I’ll get my residence permit revoked. The police were supposed to not be involved because I paid a fee at the store, but I just got a call yesterday from an officer. I feel myself withdrawing from friends and people who care about me. This is *not me*. 

But mostly I just want to stick my head in the sand. Hide. It’s painful enough to think about how I’ve been acting to write this out – my depressive episodes already feel like humiliation when I have nothing to be humiliated about, but now my behaviors are making me feel like a crazy piece of shit. My friends here don’t know about my diagnosis, and I’d really rather not bring it up right now. It’s one thing to tell them when I can show them that bipolar disorder is something that I can live with successfully, but not like this. I don’t want to tell my friends at home or my family, because what can they do from there? I’m afraid I’d only be unnecessarily worrying them. But I really feel like I’m coming apart at the seams. For the first time in a long time, I don’t feel like I’m capable of taking care of myself alone. I don’t even know where I am in my cycle, everything feels like it’s blending together into a big ball of grandiose emotions. 

Has anyone dealt with a sudden intensifying of their episodes or behaviors? Any ideas about how I can regain some amount of control over my decision-making in the heat of the moment? I’ve always had some little voice in my head that at least *tries* to remind me when something is a stupid idea (which I often ignore), but I don’t hear anything anymore.

I've had one hospital stay, after my second manic episode in which I ended up trying to hang myself, when I was 14. I had been on lithium and depakote when I was admitted and during my stay I was overdosed on lithium and became very ill, so I refused it from there on out. I was put on Trileptal and stayed on it until last year. I quit taking it after a nervous breakdown and health crisis and have been unmedicated since.Fast forward to present day, I'm 23 and I've had multiple bouts of full blown and mania and depression, I've developed an eating disorder, suffer from extreme emetophobia, and after my visit today, I was told my pdoc believes in showing signs of schizoaffective disorder, due to hearing voices, hallucinations, antisocial behavior, not taking care of myself for long periods of time, and paranoid delusions.I have actually had these symptoms for years now, but just thought it came with the bipolar disorder so I never brought it up until asked today. I feel crazy.

Everything is finally starting to make sense but I'm worried what the future holds. The voices, hallucinations, and paranoid delusions have gotten worse in the past few months and what happens when it all boils over and I have a psychotic break or something? I'm just gonna go back to bed and hope I'm not as depressed when I wake up and can hopefully get a better handle on the situation.

I'm on lamotrigine and bupropion, and happy with the doseage.  I still had some hormonal effects, and was just trying to find the birth control sweet spot that would lessen those effects and still prevent pregnancy.  It seemed like the classic triphasic pill was what worked best, even if I got a little PMS-y...but that's just life as a female.  

I was aware that lamotrigine and oral contraceptives can have negative interactions, so I asked my pdoc and my gyno whether my current medications would be ok.  They mentioned it might interfere with the lamotrigine levels, but shouldn't affect birth control efficacy.  Fast forwarding 6 months or so to July, I found a smart, sweet, STD free guy that I liked a lot and began the sexing.  I take all my pills daily and consistently, and we were in agreement about not having sex with other people, so I thought nothing of it.

Last month, however, I got hit by the worst depression I've had since I started taking medication and stopped drinking.  I barely got out of bed, ate practically nothing, and slept &gt;12 hrs a day for nearly 3 weeks.  I also found bipolar reddit, which was helpful.  Eventually I climbed out of it, and started things back up, confused and frustrated because I didn't know what had caused it.

Then I missed my period, and when it had still failed to make an appearance a week later, I took a pregnancy test.  And then another... not the cheapest one at Rite-Aid... and a digital one, just to be sure I wasn't doing it wrong.  I was indeed pregnant, and I got it verified at an outpatient clinic just for good measure.  

If their conception dating is accurate, I got pregnant without missing any BC pills, and after only having sex with my partner 8-10 times.  Fark nuts.  Thinking about the statistical likelihood of this happening gives me a headache.

For as shitty as this is to deal with, I do actually have some positives.  1) My health insurance will cover the thing whatever I choose to do with it. 2) The baster of my ovulatory turkey handled it exceptionally well, considering the shock and the newness of our relationship.  He didn't yell or scream or run away, and would be involved if I wanted to keep it, even though his preference would be to not become a dad.  He has an opinion, but accepts and supports whatever I choose.  I have no idea what our long term prospects are, but he seems like a pretty solid person, which is something I'm not used to in my relationships.  3) I recently hit 30, and as an ex-smoker, I had some fertility concerns.  Clearly unwarranted.  4) My meds are probably still working, but can't contend with the crazy baby hormones.  5) I feel strangely confident that I can handle this, and hopefully it's not just the mania kicking in.

I was diagnosed about a year ago. Been on numerous kinds of medications. 

I don't know exactly what to expect and/or feel like from this medication. 

Right before I got extrememly manic the second time, I thought that I was experiencing the effect myself and my doctors were aiming for. There was a joy inside of me when I woke up. A happiness to awake and live another day. I felt as if I was 10 years old again, as to the effect of me not experiencing that joy in years. 

When I felt the best, I was on Lamictal, Welbutrin, and Zoloft. 

I am now on Lithium, Lamictal and Welbutrin. 

For the majority of the time now I'm depressed. sleeping 12 hours at a time constantly. Lacking energy. I tell myself that this is becuase I am a lazy person, but I think there is more to it than that. 

There were a few factors involving (street) drugs when I was experiencing this newfound joy. perhaps they caused me to go manic. 

Anyways, what should I be looking for in my medications? I felt like a completely different person there. Soo happy and joyful, and would like to get that feeling back without being manic. Is that what I should be expecting? I realize that medication only does half the work - the rest being up to me.","['pobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

When I am on meds, however, I experience maybe a week of what I call 'normalcy' - very happy, outgoing, feeling like everything is going great and my life is getting back in order. Then I have a 'crash' - very severe depressive episode that usually ends up with me crying in somebody's arms for half an hour. I think that's usually when I stop taking my meds. Maybe I feel like they're not working, so why bother? Not sure.

As a side note, I'm pretty sure these meds (citalopram and lamictal) work just fine for me, because I was on them for about a year solid following my initial diagnoses of BPD II. I guess I'm wondering two things:

1) Does anybody else experience this 'crash' episode after a short period of good med time?

2) What are some ways you keep yourself on track with med management? I've talked about this with three different therapists and still can't figure it out. The closest I've come is that I'm a control freak and I don't like the pills because they make me feel like I don't have control over my own life and my own moods (which obviously, I don't, hence the diagnosis).

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in my late teens. I come from a very caring family, and I had a great childhood. Something happened to me around my 16th birthday. I don't know what, but I got really depressed and was hospitalized twice. Or at least I thought I was depressed. I don't know what to think anymore. I feel so much guilt right now. Maybe I wasn't really depressed back then, just making it all up in my brain? Maybe I just kept fueling my ""depression"" with self injuring and suicidal thoughts?

I'm having trouble returning to those times in my mind. I think of the memories as my Pandora's Box. A box in which all my demons are locked away. A box which I cannot open without letting hell loose. I feel so much guilt right now. Guilt for being diagnosed. Guilt about my behaviour back then. Guilt about cutting myself, leaving blood on my sheets, making my parents insecure. Guilt about probably lying to myself and my therapist about my depression. When I think about it, I'm sure it was all just in my mind. My BP isn't real, it's something I made up. I have been stable on meds with only minor issues, which are probably just personality traits, for years. My meds aren't ""working"", I would be the same person without, they aren't for me, I'm not really BP. I'm feeling guilty about being diagnosed with something I might just not have. I feel guilty about everything back then. All I want to do is to say sorry to everyone who were involved with me in my late teens; To my (then) psychiatrist who had to deal with me. To my parents. To my (then) girlfriend. To society, for using tax money to get me diagnosed with something I'm sure I made up in my mind.

I'm just too afraid of opening Pandora's Box. If I open up, surely I'll find I'm just an attention whore with a big ego and a need for being special.

All I want to do is to die. What keeps me from carrying it out, is just my stupid body's survival instinct. I'm sure you're going to say I'm having a depressive episode right now. I'm sure I don't. During the day I feel fine. I can feel joy from the things I like. But sometimes, suddenly, guilt just hits me like a bullet out of nowhere. Guilt about what I did back in my teens. I'm sure this is not an ""episode"", it's what I deserve for being such a horrible human being. I just want to die.

I'm sorry. I just can't open up my Pandora's Box. Not to anyone. Not even to a therapist. It's going to kill me by guilt. I don't even dare to post this under my real reddit username because I feel so guilty. I want to kill myself but I'm too damn spineless. I want this to be my final cry.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Sadly I was the last person to speak to him before he passed away in his sleep, it was ruled a heart attack... sadly that night I went over and talked to him he had taken a pain med (he had a work related injury) as he was in pain. He got a methadone pill from a coworker, as he told me this I became angry with him.... being a former addict I knew it was strong for someone that didn't take pain meds often and it isn't even really used to control pain but help with withdrawal. He was very incoherent but I had seen him like this when he had his knee operated on due to the work injury we was a lightweight with pain meds.

  Well, he was fading in and out on me and ended up falling asleep on the couch so I stayed for a bit as I was using his wifi on my laptop and I finished up, turned the lights off and let him sleep. That is the last time I saw him as he was cremated, today was his funeral services.
Throughout all of this happening, the medicine I am on which is Seroquel XR, I have had to up the dose to help keep myself 'sane', well I was doing it a lot, my doctor had me at such a low dose it wasn't doing anything.... I called and requested an earlier appointment with my doc due to the situation, but today realized I would be out of meds tomorrow and I don't have an appointment until the 20th where she could stock me back up on samples. I called today asking if I could get in sooner as I deemed this an emergency visit or at least come in to get more samples, no go.... I have to see the doc, and the soonest that would be is on the 20th... so I'm looking to be going 14 days w/o medicine..I got angry but not with the secretary on the phone and simply said please cancel all future appointments as I will just be going to the hospital even though I don't want to I feel it is my only option to ensure I stay 'level'... Just for a FYI, she had me on 25mg Seroquel XR once a day (that meant breaking a 50mg XR tablet in half) and I was taking 200mg to stay sane, I don't get why she put me on such a low dose as she had me on this med before but it was at 150mg.

  I have had some rough spots where I lost control and could do nothing but cry for my friend, he was my only friend.. he accepted everything about me including my mental issues and I have been blaming myself for not doing something that night, knowing that what he took was way too powerful and with him having heart conditions already that it was way too risky, being a former pain killer addict I knew all of the signs to watch out for and it seemed like I ignored them and most of all I hate myself because I left his house angry with him.
I know none of this is my fault, and there was nothing I could really have done...but he just meant so much to me and the loss hurts like hell and now I'm dealing with my doctor not cooperating with me during this very rough time, I don't want to go off of meds as I feel that they are working (at least at the doses I have been taking) and I'm scared I'm going to loose control after I take my remaining medication tomorrow.... I'm scared, I'm sad, I'm angry.... and I do not know what to do.

It turns out I have an out of whack thyroid, which I'm now on medication for, but my doctor also said she needs me to to seek psychiatric help.  

I'm more than willing to seek out that help.  I'm waiting for the referral to go through so that I can see someone as quickly as possible.  But I feel like I need it now.  I want it now. I want to know what's happening with me now.  I want a solution.  I want a strategy.  The interim period is killing me.  I have alienated everyone around me.  I keep binge-drinking to get rid of my racing thoughts, but it's not doing me any favors (clearly).  

I feel like it will be months before I get to the bottom of this.  My panic attacks are becoming more frequent.  My rage is becoming uncontrollable.  My depression is keeping me glued to the couch, while I rewatch episodes of The Office, for the pure and simple reason that it takes me out of my own head.  

I still haven't even seen a psychiatrist, and I know the downfalls that are implicit with self-diagnosis, but I don't think I'm wrong about this.  My dad was diagnosed, and based upon what I've read, I've been dealing with bipolar for years. 

What now?  How can I cope before I even see a doctor?  What happens before I'm diagnosed?  What happens when and if I'm diagnosed?  What happens when and if I'm prescribed medication?  What happens before the meds take effect?  How do I deal with this in the interim?  

I feel terrible.  Alone.  I'm drowning.  I don't even want my old life back; I want a vague semblance of my old life back.  I want to be able to run, or paint, or go out for coffee with a friend without feeling as though I'm going to ruin his or her day with my various episodes.

I'm a young lady in college, living away from my parents. A bit of back story, my biological father and his mother before him were diagnosed with bipolar. My mother has a degree in psychology (but organizational psychology). Well throughout high school I suspected that I may also have bipolar. I talked to my boyfriend first to see if I was crazy or not, and he said that he suspected it as well. So I talked to my mom about it and she shut me down pretty fast. She told me I'm definitely not bipolar, I have exhibited no symptoms, and I have mild depression. I shrugged and said maybe she was right.

Fast forward to August 2011. I finally have health insurance that covers therapy at my university, so I can go for free. I began to go and my counselor said that she suspects bipolar and she thinks that regular counseling sessions along with seeing a psychiatrist would be beneficial. I told my mom after that and she said that she disagrees and that I ""know how she feels about psychiatrists."" Yes, she has always been very against ever seeing a psychiatrist, to the point where she actually put the word psychiatrist down for the word ""evil"" in the game Apples to Apples. I do know how she feels about them, though I don't understand why.

I continued seeing the counselor though it didn't really help me in some ways. I still got irritable and emotional for no reason for days on end and then that would turn into being social, giddy, and a bit hyper. Finally, in November, I decided to hell with it, I want to feel like I have some control over my emotions. So I see the psychiatrist and he is very nice and helpful and he said he suspects bipolar II. He prescribed me lamictal (150 mg presently). I've been feeling a lot better, sleeping more consistent hours. Well, really just feeling more consistent in general. I still have some days where I feel irritable for no reason, or like I have the potential to get irritated, but not to the same degree as before. I know the medication is helping a lot.

My mom found out through the insurance company that I'm taking it and she told me this morning that she knew. She said it's my decision and I'm an adult so I can do what I want. But, she also said that the medication I'm on is dangerous (referring to the rash, which I have not had) and she asked me if I even researched it (the answer being yes). She said she doesn't understand the diagnosis, and that again I have never exhibited any symptoms of mania, so I am obviously just depressed. She said I jumped in to a ""last resort option"" with the lamictal. She said she was disappointed in me for not talking to her about it. I told her that I just needed time to figure out how to talk to her since I know how she feels about medication. To that she responded, ""Yes, you do know how I feel about medication, and I don't think it's necessary.""

In the end I told her I'd talk to her about it later. I guess I just want her to be supportive. Several professionals and other people in my life agree with me that I have exhibited symptoms of hypomania, and agree that she is just too caught up in her life to notice. I want her to know that the medication I'm taking is helpful, and somehow prove to her that it is not a ""last resort option,"" whatever that means. I just don't know how to get her to be supportive over something that I consider to have been a responsible decision for myself.

I have but few people will openly talk about their disorder. the only time I ever talked to anyone else about their bipolar disorder was in a mental institute, and I really didn't want to keep in contact with the people there, mainly because it is a time in my life that I would rather forget. I have family members that I talk to about my issues with this disorder but no one else understand what I'm going through. Many of them are judgmental about it. for example my grandma refuses to believe I actually have it, she insist that I just can't handle my problems and use it as a crutch to lean on, and this really hurts me. my cousin has said multiple times to me that he believes mental illness is something that can be cured through sheer will power and that medication is a waste of time and money. every time I try to talk to people about the things I see or the feelings I have they get this look on their face like they think I'm weird and most the time they try to avoid the conversation altogether.

So last week was interesting. I was getting rather hypo-manic on Thursday and it went full bore Friday. I recently upped my Lamictal from 100mg to 150 so I wonder if the drastic shift had something to do with that or if it was unrelated. Friday I had some less than positive interactions with my boss and her boss. Let's just say that my boss trampled on my right to privacy, under ADA, when she told her boss about some medical information. I confronted her about it and she didn't deny it but did ask that I no longer tell her things so we can avoid it in the future. That means she is not taking responsibility for her own actions. Oh well, at least it is documented and can be used in a future court case, if it every goes that far. I hope it does not.

I spent Saturday in a funk and Sunday was a bad day due to back troubles. Monday I on the mend and started getting hypo-manic again. That is lasting through Wednesday. I am so bad that pain meds (Oxycodone) and Valium are doing NOTHING to me. They are not calming me down I get more ""hyper"" as the day goes on.

I talked to the HR rep and she is going to look into my paperwork to see if she feels she needs more justification of me needing an accommodation. Why would she need more justification? She already has FMLA paperwork that says my condition won't change for another 6+ months. She also needs to realize that this is a life long illness. She wouldn't ask a double amputee (or even a single) to, every two months, justify that he is still without legs. How can you be this dumb and still be the head of HR? I guess she got there on her looks. What a cunt. It is hard to be mad at her because she is stunning and talks in the sweetest voice you've ever heard. However, it is all a ruse. Some people can see through it.

I was diagnosed with depression when I was 16 or so. Not a ton of people IRL realize though that its bad enough to where I have self harm tendencies. Right now I'm doing okay at not SH-Ing but it's always a challenge... I see a psychologist weekly and now also a psychiatrist every couple weeks. I don't know what I'd do without them. So at one point, my PsyD did ponder on if maybe I had ADHD (I fit it perfectly), or maybe BPD2 (which surprisingly I do actually seem to fit too)...

A few months ago I finally got assessed by a psychiatrist (but screw that guy, I'm grateful for the diagnosis he gave me but other than that, he was a dick), who said I had depression (which we already know), severe, like off the charts severe, ADHD combined type (I scored 9/9 in hyperactive and 9/9 in innattentive and I'm crazy energetic and flittery. I drove him insane), and RAD (reactive attachment disorder... I'm adopted.. I'm pretty sure my birth mother more or less kinda tried to ignore me in the womb and trying not to bond with me in any way shape or form, but still made sure I was healthy and such. My adoptive parents weren't neglectful or abusive or anything, they were kind and loving but crazy overprotective and liked to kinda keep me in a bubble. The docs said this can also be a thing for RAD, and I do have difficulty attaching to people, but if I do I'm overly attached, but I'm on the better end of the spectrum, Im nowhere near as chaotic as some other RADishes. )

PsyD and new MD (I'm gonna abbreviate as those for the rest of this, easier to type/not break Siri) both agreed with those diagnoses, but all also agree that I do have phases of mania, but it seems like it's never I guess been bad enough to concern them? I dunno.

So on top of all that I get panic attacks. Right now I take Remeron 45mg at night so I can sleep, apparently it doesn't work as an anti depressant for me, 300mg of Wellbutrin XL (boosted from 150mg I think last month?), 20-40mg Adderall XR (It's up to me, and it kinda depends on the day) and it seems to be working a bit better than most of the other stimulants I'd been on, butalbital as needed for migraines, and Mirena, the hormonal IUD. I don't take butalbital very often, one bottle usually lasts me a few months unless I take regular Adderall, which gives me constant migraines. (Adderall XL doesn't seem to do that though!)

It's bad, I know, but I'm someone who will randomly stop taking their meds. I don't like being on most of them (only reason I'm so okay with the stimulants is because I'm so desperate to retain more from class than ""something something dopamine"" that I'll try any variety of them that the MD offers.) and I like to see if I can feel I guess you'd say.... If I don't take Wellbutrin for enough days though it seems it starts getting hard to regulate my moods again and is harder to fight the urges to hurt myself. Not taking it for a bit is also how I learned Remeron doesn't do much for me other than make me sleep at night, which is kinda important, as I have HORRIBLE insomnia and a lot of the time it seems like after I've been up a day or two I'm even more energetic and even manic. I don't have to take Adderall XR daily, I was told they'll be more effective if I don't take them daily.

I haven't been taking Remeron much lately because I'd like to try not to rely on it so much, and because my schedule has been so flipped lately because the guy I'm casually seeing, I've been driving him to work at night and picking him up in the morning and then crashing at his place, but because I've been so scattered and out of rhythm, I keep forgetting to take Wellbutrin and Adderall. Sometimes I remember and will take one or both, but other times even if I remember at home, I still won't bother. 

I've been on a stretch where I hadn't taken either in a few days at least, maybe more, and still not taking Remeron, and I finally decided to try and care and I brought Wellbutrin and Adderall with me to my man friend's place. He loves seeing me happy and cheery and less likely to cut and bouncy, but I'm beginning to overwhelm him. He comes home from work tiiiiiired, and sometimes I'll have been up a day and a half and still bouncing around and trying to get him to play with me (non sexually), and so on and so forth. 

This morning I was driving us back to his place and chattering and happy and excited and VERY affectionate, and he stared at me and said ""LadyMoonstone, I love you being so affectionate and happy, but you need to take your meds.... You're manic..."" And I was like ""Is it that obvious that I haven't been taking them?"" And he was like ""yeaaaaah....... You're incredibly manic and it's overwhelming...."" And I said I'd take them when we got to his place. I'd mentioned something about when the PsyD pondered on if I had ADHD or BPD2, and he stared at me again and said ""Y'know... He may not have been wrong on part of that.... I don't think you have ADHD, I think you're actually bipolar."" And we talked about why he felt that way and I mentioned that even knowing about the mania and it coming up in convo with both MDs and PsyD and it not seeming to be a red flag and that nobody has ever diagnosed me with it. 

Dude I'm seeing, he and I are both studying psychology at school, I think he may be doing a masters, but it could be bachelors, I can't remember anymore, he has lots of degrees... Anyways, he works as a Milieau counselor, if that helps at all? At first I kinda shrugged it off, thinking he was silly, and when I took my meds and calmed down a little but was still sort of going through my manic episode, I pondered more on what he'd said to me. He also said that people with BPD are the hardest to keep on their medication because they go off it a lot, and they're harder to keep on it than schizophrenics are... He says people with ADHD will remember to take their meds and try to actually stay on them, which wouldn't fit me because when I'm not stopping meds all together, I forget to take them sometimes.... But if I didn't have ADHD, I feel like the ADHD meds wouldn't work on me how they're suppose to Y'know?

This afternoon I was thinking on it further, and realized Id definitely been doing this a few days at least and its been similar to other times I've been manic... That concerned me a bit, but I didn't bother discussing it with the doc I saw today (which he made me promise I'd go see because I'd been having pains and it seems I may have endometriosis, now waiting on approval from insurance for a laparoscopy) because I didn't know this doctor very well, she doesn't really know much of my mental health history, and her specialty is being an obgyn. 

If it helps for this at all, while I'm not certain about mental illness on my birth father's side (maybe I'll shoot him a text later and ask?), I know on my birth mothers side there is a history of depression and there's at least one cousin with BPD, and birth mom worded it as if there may be more people on her side with it.... I suspect one or both birth parents have ADHD and/or something more going on with them too, and both have struggled with addiction.

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist for Monday afternoon anyways to discuss how things are going, if Adderall XR is helping, how the panic attacks are going, etc. 

I guess what Im wondering in all this (and I'm sure at this point this post may not make lots of sense, my mind is literally going all over the place, I'm wanting to run around like mad, and I'm pretty sure my meds or at least Adderall has worn off) is if maybe my man friend is right and/or if I should be at all concerned and maybe talk to my psychiatrist Monday about this and reevaluating me and such.... If that isn't the case, is it normal for not taking meds/less sleep to cause mania? And when I am manic, should I maybe be concerned or less concerned or something? I don't seem to do anything exactly dangerous during those phases, but it's best to keep me away from anything where I can buy things. I do know that when I'm manic, it is very easy for me to run off to go shopping and spend absurd amounts of money on things.... I'm still paying off the credit card bills from the last manic shopping trip and cringing at the thought of the ""toy drawer"" (one manic episode an ex and I went to a sex shop and they were having a super sale.... Eight hours later I have enough toys and oddities to start a friggen club haha....) and some of the piles of books and DVDs in my room.... 

Alongside this, do you have any opinions/advice to maybe offer in the meantime? Thanks for reading this, I'm sorry if it doesn't make oodles and poodles of sense!","['nsubj', 'pobj', 'amod']",1,neu_vader

I was working a job that was paying me 60k a year. I bought my first house in June of last year and got an outstanding deal after hunting for three months in Austin, Texas.

Then everything fell apart.

In August of last year my paid of 1998 Jeep Cherokee broke down once again and I finally decided to purchase a newer vehicle. The job was going well, or so I thought. One week after buying the car I was unexpectedly and without warning fired from my job. Two months later my $5000 pretax income was reduced to $1800/Month in unemployment. I searched franticly for new employment and was invited to participate in nearly 40 interviews, never once receiving an offer for employment. One of the most costly mistakes I made was deciding I couldn’t afford the $600+/Month insurance through Cobra and let the insurance expire within a month I ran out of my medication for Bipolar Disorder (Abilify $1200/month on its own) In late December I started having a manic episode that lasted until the end of March. Due to the mania, I racked up a large amount of credit card bills (25k). Both spending recklessly and paying bills on the credit cards. During this time I was forcibly committed three times for a period of 24 combined days. Each time I was taken to the hospital via ambulance.

I don’t have all the bills in from of me right now but the hospital bills, medication, ambulances, everything else is easily close to $40,000. Some of these have gone to collections, others I have just started trying to get taken care of after the mania ended in March I slipped into one of the deepest and darkest depressions I have ever faced in my life and with no income (My employment ended in March) I shut down and didn’t prevent everything from going to collections. A little over a week ago I was heavily intoxicated and talking to my now ex-fiancé. I broke up with her during my manic spells and she told me she is now in love with someone else.

I had been off my medication for three months at this point. Hopelessly waiting for a chance to see a new psychiatrist. I finally said enough is enough and decided to kill myself, I was going to try and overdose. I have something like 40 various medications of various strength and variety. Luckily I only decided to take one trazadone and think a little bit longer about going through with it. The medication made me pass out in a matter of 10 minutes and probably saved my life. I continued to take the trazadone to have it knock me out for the next few days and it started working and lifting my mood. I decided to get sober again and now have 5 days under my belt. I figured out a way to save my new employer about $20,000 on the project I am assigned on too and hopefully will be brought on for a more permanent roll. It does get better out there, you have a particularly beautiful arrangement of atoms and it will take a long time for them to ever reassemble themselves like that again. If you are feeling down talk to someone, reach out, and take your meds. Life gets better.

She said that would start out real slow with 25mg every day. Fine.

First time I took it was right before sleeping. I was browsing on my phone and I could feel how heavy my eyelids became. Sweet. I woke up 11 hours later, feeling crap. 

Yesterday I took it a notch higher and took 50mg. Because of my mood swings, I have a fixed bed time at 10PM. I took my pills at 8PM, thinking that two hours later I would be knocked out enough to sleep good. Well... holy shit. I was making some late night dinner, and it was a real struggle to keep my eyes open. My speech became real slurred. My legs became really restless and I couldn't even sit down to eat my food. Went to bed at 8.30PM, thinking that I can't possibly do anything more this evening.

While in bed, I listened to my heart beating. It was beating rather fast, around 100bpm. I felt how my heart sometimes skipped a beat, like it was ""stuck"" in a beat. I got a warm rushing feeling to my face when that happened, and like a mild shock throughout my body. I continued to monitor my heart beat. The last drop was when it skipped 3 (!) beats. I thought that this was it and I've never felt so scared before. I thought for real that my heart had finally stopped beating.

I arose to grab my phone and to call 911. I noticed how my heart was beating really fast, so I was relieved to at least have a heart beat. I sat down to my computer to Google what the effects Quetiapine has on the heart. I was still pretty high, so I didn't understand even half of what I was reading, and my legs were killing me. I didn't get any proper answer from that, so I decided to stay awake. I was too scared to fall asleep now. 

Around 11PM, the meds wore off and I could think a little bit clearer. I went back to bed, but was in a sitting position, because my heart only stopped when I was lying down I noticed. Then I fell asleep.

Is this normal? Should I stop taking Quetiapine?

She has strongly recommended that I do go on medication at low doses, in combination with CBT to help level it out. 
I am determined to make the CBT work, as it does seem that you get out of it what you put in and I really didn't try last time, but medication is a new one for me. 

I don't know what will be prescribed yet, but I really don't want to go on anti-psychotics, they seem to be far more trouble than they are worth.  

I did some research and I found that the most common used drugs where I am are Lithium and Fluoxetine. Anyone have any experience with this/what I am to expect? I am sure my therapist will explain, but hands on experience helps better.

I have been with my SO for over 2 years and have always suspected he had possible bipolar or depression. He would have an extremely short attention span and always talk on and on for hours about a million different topics. He has always had many family issues and during any fights or issues at home he would become violent break things and have no memory of the episodes. Over time he learned to control his reactions and eventually only went down to emotionally shutting down for a week or so and returning to normal without having lost memory of the events when he got angry. 

Recently an extremely close family member to him had been diagnosed with terminal illness and at the onset of the news he stopped feeling any emotions at all. Although to friends and family hes acting completely normal and sometimes even enthusiastic at home and at work but he doesn't go out with friends anymore and only chats with people when necessary. 

He has completely ignored and avoided me since the news. I showed up unannounced and forced him to talk to me 2 weeks ago and realized he felt no emotions to the point he didn't even cry for the news and requested that we end our relationship since he felt nothing between us anymore. No matter how bad things were in the past he has never said he didn't love me and we have always been in a really strong relationship. He became a completely different person within a single day. 

He completely refuses to seek any professional help even though he knows he likely has bipolar or depression since he doesn't believe any medication or talking can fix him. I am the only person he has told this to and I am trying my best to be there for him by trying to message him and get him to talk to me as well as persuade him to seek help. It has been extremely tough since he has been avoiding me.

I'm a 24/F. I began my mental health treatment ""journey"" in 2010 or so. I was originally diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I moved to a new state, and a year or so after that was diagnosed with a panic disorder. Then PTSD. Then they threw in ADHD (but couldn't treat me because my school is very strict about ADHD diagnoses and the only psychiatrist I could afford was through the university). Then it was Bipolar II. Most recently, it's Bipolar I. 

I have been on DOZENS of medications in the past. Everything from SSRIs, to sleep aids, to off-label things.

I lost my insurance last summer, so I stopped treatment and my medications. I really was doing okay for a while. It's just recently (the past month or so) that I've been having so much trouble that I've decided to go back to my psychiatrist (through the university). 

To me, it appears that I'm doing some ""ultra-rapid cycling."" What I mean is, during the day sometime around early afternoon (though not every day) I become slightly manic. Not enough where I'm tearing down walls or wanting to have sex every minute of every day. (In fact, my manias are usually associated with money spending, getting ideas that will ""help"" me make a ""fortune,"" and just bursts of rage and anger). By the evening, I get so depressed I cannot function. The depression occurs more often than the mania. By morning, I'm usually pretty okay again (I don't know what normal feels like. Does anyone?).

My research tells me this is rapid cycling, but that this is also a ""type"" of bipolar. I've only done my research on BPI and BPII in the past. Can your BP change? Or is this a missed diagnosis? Or is this a sort of ""phase"" of BP?

I know the ""type"" isn't extremely important, but I like to know the specifics of what's going on. I also understand that certain medications are better than others for different types.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Bipolar disorder has made me so incredibly forgetful that I don't remember the names of people I work with on a daily basis. It's embarrassing. You can take medicines that will make it easier to deal with life, but those medications take away pieces of your life too. Even if I wanted to have children, my pills would give any potential children growing inside me a higher chance for birth defects. My libido is in the toilet as well.

I've had to deal with this kinda shit all my life.  My mom is no help as she says nothing about it.  I asked her, ""Why don't you get mad at him when he does things like that"".  Want to know what her reply was?  ""He didn't hurt him"".  So in her mind, its ok for him to go around kicking dogs.  As long as he doesn't ""hurt"" them.

I know many of you will say, you've got to get out of that house.  But where would I go?  If I go live with another family member, it would just be moving from one abusive household into another.  The whole family is like this.  I can't work.  I've tried many times within the last few years and have failed miserably.  I just can't hold a job in my condition.  I would apply for disability if I had the energy and focus to figure how to do it myself.  Even then, disability takes some time.  I'll be stuck here for a long time.

I'm sick of having to put up with his shit.  His insults, his put downs.  I'm sick of that depressive trigger every time I see his face.  I'm sick of my mom always defending him.  I'm getting close to my last straw.  I'm stronger than him now.  I can hurt him.  I do my best to get away from him when I feel like this.  But what if I draw the line?  What if I say enough is enough?  I feel like I'm the only one that can defend myself in this family because nobody sticks up for me.  They all ignore the problem.  Why can't they see that he has destroyed this family?  Why can't my mom see that my depression wouldn't be nearly as bad if she had said goodbye to him long ago.  My family wants him in their lives even after the abuse.  He's a narcissist who doesn't give a shit about anybody else other than himself.

I remember back when I was first put on Lexapro and Provigil, I would wake up every morning with a smile on my face.  I enjoyed watching thrilling movies, playing exciting games, drawing, making others laugh, surfing the internet, meeting new people, traveling--life was amazing and felt like I could do anything.  Sure every now and then I'd get sad, or I'd think about my parents and get angry, but I could put it aside.  It was manageable.

Fast forward about 6 years.  The medication started to dwindle in its magic.  Suddenly I was bored of everything.  I would get tiny fires of passion that quickly faded away.  It was hard to get up in the morning.  I began thinking about death quite often.  There was no longer a point to anything in this world.  Surely death would be better than this prison.

So I got put on new meds.  And yes, they helped, but the joy is still missing.  I don't really care much about anything.  I try, but it feels forced.  I always refer to having depression as this disconnect between your mind and your heart.  Your mind will tell you what you need to do.  Wash dishes, clean your car, do laundry.  You're mind will tell you the importance.  A clean house is a happy house.  Your heart on the other hand doesn't see the point.  That emotional sanctification of job well done is gone.  And no matter how hard you try to drum it up, the pain is still there, looping in circles with no end.

There was a time I was happy to go to sleep because I knew I'd eventually get up in the morning and start my day again.  There was a time where I enjoyed things.  I want that back.  Is that really too much to ask for?","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

I feel like I have had an endless list of diagnoses and medication. I recently made an appointment with a therapist who heard me out, looked over my medical history, and told me he was almost positive I have Biploar 2 disorder.

Since then, I have been doing my research and picked up a couple of books and done extensive reading online. I am terrified to say I feel like I am finally realizing what I have been doing to other people. Reading other people's experiences and about the symptoms of Bipolar 2 I actually have the thought that I have been letting this illness totally run my life for at least the last year and a half. I honestly have no idea how I am still here.

But hey, I am here. I also have a boyfriend who has stuck through my side for a year not only for me but my two year old son. How he is still here I have no fucking clue. We currently live in separate residences because I have pretty much run myself into the ground financially and I have scared him so badly with my behavior.
Other than that, I have no friends. I have basically cut everyone who cared about me out of my life or have pushed them so far away I would be embarrassed to seek them out. Honestly, I don't even think I am ready to build friendships with ""normal"" people. I don't think I am stable enough and I will (for right now) inevitably hurt them with my behavior.

I don't have anyone in my life to talk to. I can't keep putting every little detail and pressure on my boyfriend. He is phenomenal for being the only one here for me for so long. I just feel so desperately that I need people to relate to but I don't even know how to find them or if I am capable. 


I am nervous to talk about my son because he is the absolute center of my universe. I feel like he has remained mostly unaffected by behavior because if anything, my boyfriend and I have been responsible in keeping a support system of family and keeping my son away when I have episodes. My son also has a very loving father and an overall stable life. I live with my father and brother and they are both very loving to him and helpful. But I know that I need to gain control of my life and behavior for him and for myself. I am still his primary parent and he lives with me Monday-Saturday. He is with his dad Sunday morning through Monday. Strangely, somehow his father and I still get along great and I feel like we co-parent together very well. It's pretty much the only thing I still have confidence in. But he is extremely easy going and understanding and I also was separated from him before I had any real episodes. In fact, I'm pretty sure the day I split up with him was the first time I had a real bipolar episode and tore my life apart with it.

As far as meds go, I currently take 100 mg Zoloft a day. My doctor tried introducing Lamictal and I had a horrible reaction to it. I had nightmares that felt like they carried over into real life and after a week of taking it another suicide attempt.

I have quite a few questions..
-Where can I meet other parents who struggle with my problems? Is it a real possibility?
-How can I recognize that hypomania or an episode is coming on and take control?
-What kind of resources are out there for me being so new to this diagnoses?
-Do I have a chance of ever feeling ""normal"" again? Am I always going to struggle with my moods and behaviors?
-How have you learned to cope with guilt and feelings after an episode?
-Am I always going to feel like people only like me when I am taking medication?

I apologize if any of this seems scattered or unclear. I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this. Most of my own journals have turned into unorganized ramblings, or if I try to make sense of things on paper I end up tearing it up. I think I just really need to talk to someone who understands.

I complained to HR and they told me that things would be reopened when I turned my paperwork in. Went to my doctor, doctor told me I needed stuff filled out by HR first. Went to HR and they refused to fill it out telling me it was more than 15 days. I waited for them to sort this out among themselves and tell me what they wanted from me. In the meantime I missed a few days due to medication issues and they fired me over attendance.  
I lost my job before that because I passed out at my desk due to medication I was on. I was working and then next thing I know it's 10 minutes later. Apparently my boss walked in while this happened and took a picture of me and fired me at the end of the day for sleeping. I tried to explain that I was on medication that could cause this, and they told me they'd already told me they were firing me, it was too late to make excuses.  

So, now I'm looking for a new job, and my depression is terrible. I have difficulty making food or showering. I rarely put on clothes. I rarely leave the bedroom. I have some days that are better and I apply for jobs and things. But then I deal with this horrible feeling that... I'm not going to be able to maintain a full time job.

I wasnt even being bad I was being rational and I just wanted to discuss. She also said that my prior ups and downs were probably just based on pot and alcohol use not mental illness.

Was diagnosed in Jan '14 with BP2 after seeking counseling due to grief from the death of my father the month prior.  Had previously been diagnosed with chronic depression, having had 6 bouts over the course of 18 years. During a most of those spells, had used Venlafexine. It certainly got me out of a funk, but led to wildly reckless decisions, etc.  I had been on Venlafexine when my father passed. Between the time of my father's death and the diagnosis, I went on a vacation, spent too much money and had more fun than I should, to say the least.

So pDoc added Lamotrigine, hoping to bring me down a little.  I swung into a major depressive state over a matter of weeks, so pDoc took me off Venlafexine. I was still in withdrawal and sick as hell, working too much and traveling for work.  Filed FMLA due to ongoing pdoc and psych appointments and lingering fear the meds would mess me up too badly.

And then one of my grandmothers died. We buried her the day before my father.  I was grieving very hard, but sucked it up and sank all my available energy into work (+50hr work weeks), feeling like I had no other option due to lack of support from my employer.  Just the Lamotrigine seemed to level me out a little, but I remained very lethargic and slept 10 hours a night.  So pDoc added buproprion in May.

And then another grandmother died.  Rather than go through another merry-go-round with drugs this time, I chose to stay on lamotrigine and buproprion. It did seem to help get me back into a routine even if I had ZERO interest in my job and continued too work more than was healthy; Resentment breeds apathy, etc... I even made it to the gym a few times (used to be on a 4x weekly sched, sigh).  I continued with talk therapy. It has been helpful, though I still hold a lot of unresolved emotions about my father's life and death.

And then a few weeks ago, my friend died.  It was just more than my vulnerable little psyche could handle.  Took medical leave from work (getting screwed on short-term disability).  I am supposed to go back in 2 weeks.

And today, my pet was diagnosed with an aggressive, terminal disease and I'll probably have to put him down next week.

What sort of life lemon is this, a whole bushel-full?? Who the hell did I piss off so bad to get such a curse?  I'm stupefied how so much crap can rain down at once.

I just don't know what else I can do and how much more I (or anyone!) should reasonably be expected to deal with - much less anyone!  I am so out of options on how to improve my life at this point. If folks could stop dying for a while, that'd be dandy.

Am I being completely illogical in thinking these are extraordinary circumstances that nearly anyone would struggle to cope with? I'm starting to question my sanity at this point.  Third party perspective would be appreciated.

TLDR; BP2 - 4 deaths in 8 months. Took medical leave. Now pet is dying.  How the hell am I supposed to cope and ""get well enough"" to go back to work in 2 weeks?",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

My appointment was about a month ago, at the same time I experienced a break up. So you can imagine the conflictions of regular heart break actions, to being unstable and untreated. Me and my now ex SO have been going through a roof patch,(we broke up feb 15, and I would say we we're in a rough patch for about a month) We have have been together for just alittle bit over 6, but have dated previously. He is 19 year old male. We we're arguing about his lack of communication skills and how much time he spends at work, but it was nothing major. He is a personal trainer and works around 6am to 7,9pm everynight. Me being a part time worker, and having acces to a car I had alot more alone time, and flexibility then him. But more importantly, I have been having more episodes and mood swings then ever before in my life. Valentines day we got into an argument, long story short made up had sex, then I was so angry and depressed for hours after and was telling him I wanted to break up. Moments after, I snap out of it and am overly sexual, happy, and I know this is not okay behaviour. 

He told me he still loves me but this is all too much for him. We are both having a really hard time with the break up. I still am very much in love with him and despite some of the regular issues couples had we both did really care and trust eachother. I want to reach out to him because I feel alot of our issues had to do with my episodes. But it's hard for me to feel what is right or wrong. I'm not sure if this is enough information but I am trying to reflect logically and I normally started the fights, due to overthinking, not being able to sleep, or being impulsive, as he is a relatively laid back guy. Is there anyway to go about talking to him about this without being to heavy? Or is it best I leave this guy alone and move on. He has told me many times I go from one to ten, but has always been supportive and tries to understand. 

I feel now I had a mental breakdown for the majority of February. 

Very few people in my life know this about me as I am a relatively up beat, fun happy person in my work and social life. 

I feel bad I put alot of pressure on him to go with my 'manic' sprees, and to fix everything when depressed. I want to slowly work on things because he still admits to being in love with me. My medication has been helping and I do have 2 people really close to me who I trust and encourage me to continue bettering myself. I really want to slowly talk, and be casual.

Should I jus give him his space? Or should I not reach out to him at all? I do not want to be hysteric, or guilt tripping. I genuinely want to see him and explain all the things I can now classify as episodes with the help of my doctors.

Recently i found this subreddit (and kinda reddit actually) and it's really helping me to realise i am not alone. I am not met anyone who has bipolar disorder so this subreddit is gold mine to me. Also sorry for grammer mistakes, english is not my mother language.

I am writing this because, well i have no freaking idea about what to do now. I think i'm gonna start from the beginning. When i was in last year of high school i realized that i am the laziest person ever lived. In my country there is a test that everyone needs to take to go university. And everyone was studing their ass off. At this point i need to say that i am not a irresponsible person. I am never worried that much in my life. But still i cant study. I can't even do anything. 
Wake up - Go to school - Worry about not studying - Go to sleep  Basically this was my average day.

I tried everything but still i couldn't find any strength to go study. So i told my mom to take me to a psychiatrist but we were kinda broke that time. So i was out of ideas. There was a scar inside of me that keep getting bigger and i was just sitting my ass of watching it grow. Whatever, i take the test, failed miserably and a bam new year that i need to study. Now i am not a student i am just a 18 years old dude with no job no school. 

After couple of mounths i start to think that maybe i was just suck at math, chemestry etc. I dont know i just want to not worry anymore. Drawing is my number one passion so i decide to study for finearts. If you want to get in the school you basically need to take a skill test(I don't know what it's called in english) where you draw what they want. If you are good enough you are in.

I started the taking drawing classes. First 2 week was great. I was drawing (not as my much i want to but still better than nothing) without losing concentration and motivation. But after two weeks drawing was same to me as studing for math or any other subject. I was thinking basically i am just a huge asshole who don't give a crap about anything at all. At this time my mom see my suffering so she take me to a psychiatrist. 

I think my mom take me to a psychiatrist before when i was 8 for same reason: can't study or listen teacher in school. So psychiatrist start asking question to both my mom and me. We talked like 20 minutes and then he said he's gonna give me a pill that later i found out that it's a antidepressant pill. I was thinking he is just giving me this because i am a teenager. But i start the taking this pill and went to talk to him after one week. He was asking me how i feeling then asking my mom how she think i am feeling. Then he said he is gonna give me more pills. At this point i am really confused because he is giving me lots of stuff but telling me nothing. In third session i asked him what is wrong with me. He said that i have social phobia.

This was making sense to me because even when i was a kid i known that i am different. When i saw my sister running around playing interacting with other kids so easily or when i was in street i have no idea to what to do with my hands or when i feel super awkward with new people. I know i was different but this was not the problem. Because anxiety, depression i can deal with this. But not wanting to study this is whole another thing. I feel like i'm gonna be like this forever in my life. I told this to him basically. He said i can't study because i cant get motivated i cant get motivated because i'm in huge depression.

So he start to change my meds and again and again i asked what is wrong with me why aren't you diagnose me with something. He just said that there is something wrong with chemicals in my brain and i need to take meds for balancing. I'm still confused because i'm reading lots of stuff internet and everyone says they diagnosed with social phobia or another mental disorder.

After a few mouths he give me a new pill(damn it i can't remember the name.) After taking this pill i was basically a different person. I used be a shy awkvard guy with a super low esteem. But with this pill i feel like a hercule; i try to make people laugh, i am really inappropriate and have lots of self-esteem. I even start to enjoying drawing again. It was somewhat awesome experiance for me. But at the sametime i have no idea who i am anymore. After one week of this weird feellings i realized something. No matter what i do i always feeling some kind of anger inside of me. I can't relax no matter what i do. 

After i told this to my psychiatrist he cancel that pill. And ask him why still i cant study what is wrong with me crap. He is now telling me that i have bipolar disorder. I never heard of this disorder. I was really really confused. This guy giving me all kind of pills and i cant study now i have another disorder. Seriously what the heck? 

So i started to reading about bipolar disorder. And after reading about this disorder i was sure i was bipolar. Only thing i don't understand is i never had a manic episoder before i take that pill. If i have bipolar why i have millions of depressive periods but just one manic episode.

Currently i am taking Paxera 20 mg - Lamictal 25 mg. Honestly meds helped with almost everything. I am not feel like a hercule but i am not a shy guy either. I think finally i start to be myself now. I kinda want to change my psychiatrist but currently this is not a option for me.

Now lets talk about present time. I am not feeling sad. but i am not happy either. Actually i don't feel anything. I know i can be sad or angry earlier but not happy for 4+ years. And now i feel nothing. Good thing people can't hurt me because i dont give crap but still it's sucks. I never been brave enough to talk to a girl any period of my life. (Yeah, i am 18 and i have never even hold a girls' hand.) But a few weeks earlier i actually ask a girl out. (which is a miracle for me.) But she rejected me. Now after that i feel something but well its kinda ironic but i think i feel just emptiness. Like my heart is completely empty. There is no emotional feeling. No passion, no anger , no happines, nothing.

I still think i feel better than before i start the going psychiatrist though. But still i have no idea how to start practicing. There is only 3 months left for skill test and i am just sitting here browsing reddit and other stuff. Somebody just help me please. What should i do? I tried everything i know. Maybe i dont have any disorder -like i said before- maybe i am just a lazy asshole but there is only one thing i am sure of; i tried every f'ing thing. 

Edit: Holy shit, i think i just killed the english. What to do ""know""? I'm really sorry guys. I just suck at english apparently.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Being recently diagnosed Bipolar II, and going through the process of trying different medication cocktails, I'm in a tricky spot. I can't tell if my meds are starting to work, or if I'm hypomanic.

So - how can YOU tell the difference? 

Please let me know if you want me to provide further info for advice giving purposes...

Thanking you all in advance for sharing!","['compound', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

   Without getting too in detail, I was depressed 'on and off' since I was six years old, around the time my brother and sister were born severely premature and almost died, which gave them lasting disabilities. I love them to death, don't get me wrong. 

   I was cutting from 11 on, and once my parents found out at 12 I was in and out of the hospital at the crisis centre. I was referred to a psychiatrist who said I had a mood imbalance and put me on a vast array of meds. Seroquel was the first, diazepam being last. He was really impersonal and usually just asked if I had friends at school. 

   In high school I mostly just abused pain killers I was prescribed for chronic migraines. From T3's up to fentanyl patches (why would you prescribe these to a teen?)

   Anywho fast foward to being 20 and actively suicidal when I was brought to the hospital again and was ordered another psychiatrist. After being on Abilify (ugh) Effexor (nope) he prescribed me Wellbutrin and it was like the sun shone again.... with a ton of anger issues and racing thoughts. Along with Ritalin and then Vyvanse for my ADD, I was an irritable yelly mofo with constant racing thoughts and I just felt awful. I never thought I would be normal again.

   I'm in nursing and first read about Bipolar disorder in a textbook and I felt like I was reading a description of myself. It made me uneasy because it made *sense*. All those times I thought I was magically better, staying up all night with a smile completing school work because oh my god I am so great at everything. In college I had a 2.55 GPA one semester, and a 4.15 GPA the next. Err. 

   Fast forward to now. My psychiatrist somehow goes on vacation every other month so I made an appointment with my family doctor and told her the Wellbutrin was making me mix cycle and the symptoms I had. She put me on Seroquel, but she's keeping me on 50 mg per day until I can see my psychiatrist to make sure my meds won't cocktail in a weird way and if Seroquel is the best course of action.

   To me, it helps me sleep and decreases (not completely) the racing thoughts about anything and everything random, calms me down, and I feel like I can love my SO again. 

   I'm sorry for the super long post, but I've been terrified of living my whole life being miserable and I feel like for the first time that may not be the case. I was terrified of having children, terrified of being a nurse and even a wife because of this disorder wreaking havoc on my moods. It may take a while to find the right medication but it will be worth it and I have faith now. :)


tl;dr: suicide rollercoaster my whole life, at 21 dx'd, Seroquel pretty cool.","['nsubj', 'dobj']",1,neu_vader

I was previously diagnosed with major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder. I've had a psychiatrist tell me I may have borderline personality disorder. 

I have long bouts of depression and moments where I fell like I could defeat the world. I've had moments were I thought I was psychic, believed that my son could quite possibly be the the second coming of Christ, and I feel like I have a special connection with Christ.  I have fits of rage,  delusions, talk out of my head.

 There is a constant inner monolog going on with in me. I talk to myself and feel as though I have a special connection with animals.  I'm hypersexual, and at times I believe I am irresistible to men. I've been a thief, alcoholic, drug addict and extremely promiscuous (younger years).

 I've taken multiple types of antidepressants that work for a little while then it fades.  The only meds that ever seemed to work were mood stabilizers. I've never been completely honest with my docs or anyone about my thoughts, because I don't want to appear ""crazy"". I'm in my mid thirties, my marriage is failing. I feel as though I am a victim and under attack, but my husband tells me that I am verbally and emotionally abusive at times.

 I guess I just needed to vent and would like some feedback. I'm stressed and have to get this out. I'm not suicial, however I would like to run my car into a tree. Hoping it would crack me open like an egg so the pain could spill out.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

* Keep track of trends in your behavior
* Surrogate memory for people with memory loss (like me)
* Collect your thoughts and give yourself a coherent narrative

My journal has been a dear friend during times of severe stress or traumatic events. During times like these I'll write in my journal several times a day, and it helps me get away from everything and write out my problem. Gives me a great excuse to give myself pep talks or motivation or write out solutions and lines of thinking I can use to make sense of my environment. 

I also feel more together when I've been writing consistently, because every night my life's narrative picks up from where it left off the night before. I'm writing down the story of my life. No matter how boring or controversial or crazy it might be, it goes in my journal and I can put it out of my mind a little bit easier.

I also have my monthly psych visits to think about. I wouldn't have figured out that my meds weren't working well enough if I hadn't had my journal to keep record of the patterns in my moods and behaviors. I discovered that I was still having mood swings that interfered with my life - they were just mild enough that they didn't cause havoc. 

So I wouldn't have had this info to give to my pdoc, and he wouldn't have changed my meds accordingly. I already feel a little better knowing that my new meds might finally let me be free of symptoms.

I highly recommend a journal. I was skeptical about it until I started doing it. I have some tips if you want to get started:

* This is a book you will be writing in and looking at on a regular basis, hopefully until it's completely filled up. Find one you like, one that's special. After all, it's your *life* that you're filling it with. Spiral-notebook type journals are easier to work with.
* Go look for a pen that feels really good to write with. I use a Papermate Profile 1.4mm ballpoint when I'm writing, and only that, because they glide across the page. Pens are important! :)
* Write whatever you want, especially if you don't feel like writing. Even if it's just a few words, it will be handy later on. The absence of content can tell you as much as the presence thereof. Don't worry about themes or coherence. Anything you write is valuable.

So there y'all go! My little nugget of wisdom for the day.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I can't even get a job in a place with a booming workforce. I can't even work a construction job because I assume I have a vagina and I've never seen/heard of a woman doing this. I would love to do oil rig stuff, but I don't think I could handle that when it comes down to it either. I'm just getting really hopeless. You can't tell me to have hope, it's getting real now.

My best friend of my entire life, birth to now, just called me to say his mom left his dad. But it isn't that simple, as in a regular divorce.

His mom has a very obscure mental disorder, an offshoot of bipolar and schizophrenia. The medication she takes restricts her episodes to occurring every few years and they change each time. We think this is one of them, she was having some physical symptoms, but nothing we could point to. She flat out left his dad, but I don't have all the reasons now.

The plot thickens, as they have 3 sons. The youngest my friend, is 18. The other 22, another 25. The 25 year old has the same disorder as his mom, and is at home recovering from the first episode he had, triggered by a separate family issue. It is very much so within the realm of possibility that my friend has the same disorder, and I'm worried for his mental health.

He's expressed that he is distraught over the leaving, but feels mentally normal. I need to know how to help him. I guess that the best course of action would to not speculate on the disorder and help with the issue at hand, the grief of his parents splitting. Could somebody with experience in helping people, or dealing with divorce, please help me? What are some of the warning signs for Bipolar? I don't know what to say to him. Please, anybody, with anything help me. He's my best friend and it's killing me to see him like this.

All I can say is ""awwwwwwwwkward......"" I don't think I've ever experienced anything as awkward as talking to this doctor.

(my current Doc wanted me to do that as well, but I had been balking at it because of the cost issue).

I did succeed in getting a one month refill on my Seroquel. Which is good.

I had been on wellbutrin for about nine months, but stopped because it was making me super rapid cycle wicked bad. I was off for about 2-3 months when I got a new rx for Lamictal and was up to 50mg. 
The day of the train I had an rx for a dose increase in the lamictal and a new rx for wellbutrin. Sadly I couldn't fill them for about a week, but now that I'm a few weeks in I think I finally may have found my combo, which is amazing cause I lost count after a dozen different meds and this is try 3 for both, though first time together.

So that's a bit of the setup. After the train everyone I knew kept saying how they were glad that I was still alive, and seeing my family's reaction to a near fatal (though in the end relatively benign) accident I couldn't fantasize about SU anymore. This is incredibly odd for me because it's always been there since the beginning, even when I was up it was the back-stop in my mind (""well, I don't have to worry cause I'm just gonna kill myself someday anyways, so why not…"" etc). Having the memory of their faces and their voices just killed it for me somehow.

So the next week I was depressed and super anxious, even frightened, because the thought of looking forward through 40+ more years scared the shit out of me (still kinda does). As the weeks passed the meds really started helping and leveling me out. In ten years I have never felt this way. Now when things start going down, they suddenly level out before I hit rock bottom. Same with on the way up. I'm slowly learning to live in the moment rather than constantly project in my mind my entire future depending on my mood (either crash and SU or become a famous writer/traveler/inventor/etc then burn out and SU… usually).

At first I saw my life returning to my hands, and I was excited. Then it started dawning on me how much I used the looming SU or my (hypo)manic states to motivate me into action. I've been planning on moving far away from home (NYC or Boston) and I was afraid that I'd chicken out and end up stuck in the same damn hometown I've wanted out of forever. Then I realized that I really want to move out. I still want to write and after the decade of shit I've gone through I fucking deserve it.

The evolution of this whole new experience, though, has felt uncertain. It's like a battle between the sensible side of me (the one that says to be careful, prepare, don't take risks, just take it slow, but you can make it champ, etc) and the self that was the voice of hope/action while in the shit storm. The one that says I need to just jump and figure it out when I land, cause otherwise I'm never getting out of here and I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

The realization I've been having the past few days is that even though my moods may finally be under some semblance of control does not erase the 10+ years I've gone through. You can't live on the verge of suicide for that long and not have it effect you. I can't just forget the fact that my friends and family weren't there for me like I feel they should have, like how I desperately needed. I got by on the idea that when push came to shove I could do something drastic and/or amazing and the one biggest gift of the whole bipolar thing has been the way it has driven my desire to take a risk on my dreams, to not be afraid and fall into mediocrity.

And even though the sensible hopeful person had the reigns for the first couple weeks, more and more I’m seeing that the person I’ve been, the one that got me through this decade alive will not be happy with compromising anymore. I‘ve already given up way to much and this is my Alamo. I found myself saying that I should push back the date of moving out more and more, that maybe I should take this or that job because it’s the sensible idea even if it’s not at all what I want or where I want to be. The longer it went the sicker inside I felt and now I know that I have to take the chance. My goal has been to be in NYC (or maybe Boston) by October 1st. And goddamit it’s going to fucking happen even if I have to live in some rat infested studio and eat nothing but ramen. If I could do that for so long through college while my moods were all over the place, then I can do it now.

So many people accept a life they never wanted, and that cannot be me, not after what I’ve been through. I’ve had to give up so many career goals and opportunities because of my illness and I’m drawing the line. I’m moving out, finishing my book, and if I can help it I’m never coming back. This is my fucking life.

That means this whole 2-week hell process is getting over sooner. This part of new medication sucks - many of you know exactly how nasty some initial and long term side effects are - some have never been fully informed of what they may experience because ""may cause nausea"" written in size 10 font on the label doesn't prepare you to wake up in cold sweats heaving into a trash can at 2 AM. 
""Dizziness"" doesn't prepare you for that feeling like someone let off a flash bomb next to your head in the middle of your work day. 
And ""jittery feeling"" doesn't prepare you for what feels like you've been given a coffee enema that's about to make your heart explode - especially if you are trying to sleep.

And I am not saying every anti-depression/anti-anxiety/mood stabilizer/ect. is going to give you any or all of these to these extremes but eventually it's a safe bet you are going have some that are going to make you wish you never even heard of that pill. That's why a lot of new patients stop taking their meds - they don't want to cope with the side effects. And yes some of the side effects just fucking suck but you need to gauge how uncomfortable you are now vs. what that medication will do for you in the long run. 

I've personally been on this medication before so I **know** the benefits outweigh the side effects, which is why I'm glad I'm getting this nausea crap out of the way now. But I have been through many meds that I had no clue if they were worth it or not. Some were, many weren't. The point is you have to really put forth a lot of effort sometimes to get the benefit - That medication could significantly improve the quality of your life. I'm hearing of too many stories about people that just quit and *you can't do that.*  You have to at least give it a shot - get through the initial acclimation phase (typically 2 weeks) then the trial period (typically 2-6 months) and then you and your doctor should make a decision about where to go from there. But don't give up, you need to **really try** for your own sake. 

TL;DR - You need to seriously understand that the long-term benefits of many drugs far outweighs the initial crappy side effects. This post was mainly for people that are newly diagnosed and those who have given up on their meds before solely because of side effects. ","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

I have removed a post due to rampant rule violations throughout. 

People, it is in our sidebar that you can absolutely talk about pot use but **you are simply not allowed to advise people medically or recommend that they try something without linking to some peer-reviewed sources.** That means you can't advise them on how to use pot, how to obtain pot, what kind of pot to try, and no, you can't even suggest they try it. We all know it's out there. We all know some of us use it. But the fact remains that it is utterly irresponsible to recommend someone obtain something that is *still illegal* in a great many places. 

While I feel there are some exciting developments in the application of marijuana used medically (low THC, high CBD strains for epilepsy) and it may one day be standard treatment, as it stands currently there aren't many peer-reviewed studies. 

If you think pot might help you, I urge you to talk to your doctors, obtain it legally, hell, participate in studies if you can so we do have the literature and know for sure, but as things are... 

* It doesn't work for everyone and there are studies that indicate it can make symptoms worse. 

* Illicit sources can and often do splice it with any number of chemicals and other drugs and genetically modify it to make the effects more potent and addicting, again, bad idea for bipolar people to take drugs that might exacerbate their symptoms. 

* If you want to try it, your best bet is to obtain it legally as medical grade pot, and your doctor needs to know what you're doing both for dealing with possible med interactions and determining if your symptoms are drug-induced or bipolar-induced. 

* While it probably won't kill you to take it with other medications, if you are on pot while testing legitimate medicine to see if it will help you, it can skew the results. It can take years to find the right med combo, and if you use pot and your doctor doesn't know, you very well could wind up thinking your medicines don't work when they do, or do work when they don't, potentially prolonging your agony for years. Tell your doctor what you're on. Even the illegal stuff. That way, they can best help you. 

And again, I can't stress enough, if you are posting about pot as a potential treatment... Back it with peer-reviewed studies published by a scientific journal, or don't post it at all because if we see it, it will be removed.

It might legitimately help you specifically, and if it does, that's great, but don't post until there's more than just your anecdotal evidence. Because you're likely not a scientist studying it, you can't possibly know for sure if it's the pot or if it's placebo, or if your brain chemicals are coincidentally level spontaneously with no causation to the correlation. You can talk about using it. You can talk about being high if you want. But you can't suggest it's a viable treatment option without evidence. ","['pobj', 'dobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

TL;DR:
Hence, even if I am crazy... I'll simply treat ADHD (and even that only as needed).

1.
I recently wrote a post to both R/ADHD and one to R/BiPolar.

I wrote in long detail of recent events that could be seen as Mania. 
-Many chimed in and I thank you all who participated. 

I saw my Psychologist, she feels me on this. 


-2. Re: Possibly manic at times.

-Let this diagram represent the scale of  “belief” in psychiatric illness, existing.

-    [ABC-------------------------XYZ]

-Where “ABC” represents DOUBTERS (“work harder.”, religious types).

 -And “XYZ” represents Pure believers – DSM writers, deciding what’s “normal”.
-The left extreme and right extreme are both incorrect.

Re: Sleep is essential in both conditions. 
""normal"" or not... Manic, Hyperactive, or whatever... sleep is necessary. 

So, perhaps my *hyperactivity* won't go into *mania* when things are going well, when I sleep enough, post solving some issues.

It's kind of like Wilfred (No, I'm not that ""crazy""). 
I may be outside *norms* at times, but really... If I'm functional... who cares? 

-3. One question:
-IF someone was set off with Mania when they were prescribed anti-anxiety (SNRI) medication is that indicative of Bipolar?
-Also with various substances. (All this is far removed now. I'm clean.)

-For now, I'll just make sure my life is on track. 
-I know what I want... 
-I don't want side effects (hair loss, appearance affects, memory loss, cognitive impairment) to be 10% ""more sane"". --- According to who? 

""You are not crazy, but yes you take risks, make bad decisions, and are pretty much the poster boy for ADHD.""  --&gt; My Counsellor. 

-Some agree/ some don't. 

-I see this may seem like ""trying to convince me"". It's not. 

****SPOLERS in next 2 lines.****
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  *SPOILERS for WILFRED Fans* In the ending... he kind of saw the truth and ACCEPTED it. So do I... but It's all perspective. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-4. As long as you don't ""lose it"", ""off yourself"", ""go to jail"", etc... 
what's the difference? 
-Just make good decisions and get help if and only if needed.

On Buspar, I felt like a tame version I myself but in a (mostly) good way; my moods were more constant AND consistent, my anxiety had coagulated and stilled, I didn't feel any side effects- no emotional numbness, no loss of creativity or creative motivation, my sex drive leveled out (previously, it was always when I was manic.) 
But I was still quick to anger, I still got scared and angry (without being able to identify the former) when someone chose to disagree with me. I still complained about philosophical quandaries with almost everything, but at least I didn't feel the obsessive need to go on and on indefinetly.

This year, the clinic I was going to dropped my care (maybe because I demanded they mail me medication because I tried picking it up on a day they were closed, then tried demanding gas money, then I proceeded to tell this secretary of a christian non-profit ever fallacy in their operations.) I had a backup supply of med because I was planning in moving out of state (which has been held up for other reasons.) But now I've been out for about two weeks.

I'm looking for other doctors, with the hope that if I show them my collection of prescription bottles, they'll just write me another one. But on the other hand, I may try to change my meds.
In the last month or so that I was medicated, my boyfriend came to me and said he didn't think I was as balanced as I thought.

I guess what I'm wondering is what does ""working medication"" look like? I know that phrase is really subjective, but what kinds of differences did anyone notice in themselves?  What kinds if side effects did you experience?

Rarely have I taken them regularly. Due to the desire to just kind of get my shit together, I've been taking them regularly for the last 5 months. These fucking side effects fucking blow and I'm really fucking tired of them. Everything that seems to go wrong with me seems to be a side effect of these fucking meds and then when I go to the doctor about it, he's just like.... well, here take something else. I was perfectly ok with the whole side effect of it taking forever for my boyfriend to make me cum or even the fact of having to drink water every five seconds to prevent my mouth and throat feeling like the Mojave Desert. I was fine. 

But in the last few weeks, it has not been pretty. I started shaking so bad at work they wanted to call the ambulance because they were afraid I couldn't drive. I have been constantly lightheaded with continuous headaches in all parts of head. Also (fun fact) if you touch my head, it hurts. My arms and shoulders sometimes twitch. When I wake up in the middle of the night, and for the first half hour of me being up in the morning, I have horrendous coordination and it's like being drunk. I go to the emergency room when I start shaking so bad I can't hold on to anything, and they give me a CT scan and blood work and tell me everything is normal and send me away. 

My psychiatrist tells me that these are side effects of my meds and that Im just going to have to deal with them but here, take a prescription for Klonopin in case it gets real bad again. 

But the fucking kicker was today. My glasses have been extremely weird lately. I've been having trouble focusing and need to take my glasses off to read. Turns out that my meds are messing with my eyesight and that I need FUCKING BIFOCALS. IM 25! WTF!

I really can't take these fucking side effects any more. I'm kind of feeling like maybe being bipolar wasn't the worst thing in the world. I mean, so I spent alot of money and did some stupid shit and tried to kill myself a few times. Big deal.

This is a guy I really made an effort to get along with, someone I considered a friend, who now won't even see me, meaning my SO has to choose who to sped time with now. My SO can't understand why I'm so upset by someone disliking me, and I know I don't need everyone to like me, but it's the reason he dislikes me that upsets me so much.

I'm staying with him and his family for a week, and he's just gone over to this friend's house for the evening, his sisters are also out, so it's just his mum and I at home, and I feel incredibly awkward. He says if I'm unhappy I should go home, but the reason I'm here is because I'm so unhappy at home (my flatmate is a nightmare, my friends have left town for the summer, and my mum won't le my dad see me or talk to me because I didn't go visit her a couple of weeks ago).

I don't have words to describe how I feel right now. I cried almost all of last night when I found out his friend wouldn't see me anymore, and my SO just thinks I'm being controlling and wanting him all to myself, and don't want him to see his other friends, but this isn't true, as although he hears me, he doesn't actually listen to what I say.

I've asked several time in the last couple of days if we could do something other than sit around playing games on our laptops, such as go out, go to the cinema, go play tennis...ANYTHING. But by bringing that up now I'm apparently being controlling as he now claims I haven't mentioned anything like that at all.

I'm so hurt, so frustrated...how can I explain that things that don't matter to most people mean everything to me? And how can I explain a rapid cycling episode brought about by medication not working to someone who has no experience of anyone with psychological problems, who just wants to brand me as 'crazy'? If I'd done something to actually upset him I could understand, but him deciding to having nothing to do with me after hearing about my mental state from a third party and not actually witnessing it himself...this hurts so much, and I don't know how to explain this to my SO.



I'm sorry if this is garbled, but I'm so upset that I everything in my head is muddled. I'm sitting in someone else's house, crying my eyes out in frustration and hurt, I don't know what to say or do.","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

After some violence on my end to some drama occurring while intoxicated I got myself home and went to sleep. I vaguely remember telling a couple about the situation before falling asleep.

I awoke October 3rd.
From my understanding I stayed in the house most of the day, sleeping mostly and going about my regular activities, including going to UPS with my father to drop off a package. When I awoke I asked him where the package went and that's when I learned what happened.
I do not drive so it's unlikely I left the house besides that delivery.

I don't remember anything in that timeframe whatsoever from falling asleep to waking up days later.

Show some support! That's what we're here for! Yeah, it absolutely sucks that someone's meds are working after the 2nd combo when you've been working on combos for years, but that doesn't mean you should downvote them out of spite or jealousy.

I know downvotes are really completely arbitrary, but I know a couple of people who are afraid to post their own poetry because they take those downvotes personally. I have a sister who refuses to use reddit all together because she's afraid of downvotes!

Be nice to eachother! Show support! Every person's small victories against this disorder is a step closer to helping YOU. If more and more people show success on X medication, maybe that's where the best treatment is, and you wouldn't know about it if someone didn't say something.

Anyway after it took me a long time to titrate up to 150mg I started feeling really good in May and the start of June...my pdoc and I thought it was because the meds were working but in mid June I started heading back down into a depressive episode and I still am in the same depressive episode. I met with my pdoc a few weeks ago and told her I wasn't feeling good anymore. She thinks that its just because my body got a taste of the Lamictal and it helped but now it needs more. So she bumped me up to 250mg which I have been on for almost 2 weeks now and I haven't noticed any difference. I've actually been feeling a bit worse and getting worse sleep of the last couple of weeks. So I think I may have actually been in a hypomanic episode instead of the meds actually helping. Typically I either get angry hypomanic or mixed states. I am going on a trip next week and wasn't going to have enough meds for the whole trip so she called in a script for me and gave me a 90 day supply of it. 

I'm meeting with her again in about a week and a half and I feel really bad about telling her that im still feeling depressed and that the meds aren't working cause she just got me so much of the lamictal that would go to waste if we try something else. 

So I was wondering for those of you who didn't find a med that worked first go. Did your doc add another med to what you were already on or just tried something completely different? I know its different for every person and how their doctors handle things but I just want to get an idea of what people have had happen. I feel bad about wasting so many pills if its still not working in a couple weeks and we decide to switch.

I'm slogging through what I've come to known as an ""episode"", but this one has lasted since November and is showing no signs of going away any time soon. I'm used to cycling through episodes of depression and normalcy throughout the year, usually suffering ""major"" episodes every couple of years. This one has been the worst; I feel dead inside, I sleep anywhere from 10-15 hours a day, I am only functioning enough to go to work when I have to. It's impossible for me to find any joy in the things I used to love and I feel like I've been hibernating for nearly a year.


I finally decided to get help when my boyfriend and I were at couples therapy for what I thought was an unrelated issue and our therapist became very concerned at how pervasive and long-lasting my depression was. She convinced me to seek in-patient or intensive out-patient treatment immediately, which I sought out from two separate facilities. When I found out the price tag on going that route for treatment was almost $4K for four - six weeks of intensive outpatient, I said, ""Fuuuuuck that."" I then went through the process of trying to find a reputable psychiatrist who would see me as soon as possible -- I was lucky to find one who could fit me in a month later and was charging only $150 for the initial assessment, instead of the $300-500 the other offices were charging.


I finally  had my assessment with him today. I explained my history with depression and my current symptoms: my inability to focus, my hypersomnia, the binging and purging patterns I fell back into, feeling completely detached and brain-dead, having zero motivation or interest in absolutely everything, etc. I told him I'd been most recently prescribed Wellbutrin XL and felt like it had just made my irritability and depressive qualities even worse. I also explained that I'd taken a couple of different anti-depressants over the years, without much success. Wellbutrin was the last ""type"" of antidepressant I hadn't tried, so I was really hopeful; I wish it had just fixed everything.


He wrote me an order to get some blood work to check for thyroid problems, then asked if I'd ever been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was immediately taken aback -- Bipolar disorder? Excuse me? I'm here for my depression, I don't even HAVE manic episodes. I have a few friends who have been diagnosed with mood disorders before -- two of them committed suicide, one overdosed and died on my couch. One of my best friends has bipolar disorder and I rode that crazy rollercoaster for almost a decade, until I finally had to cut ties because it was so extreme. 

So, my psychiatrist says he thinks I have bipolar disorder. I guess he saw my expression shift when he told me his diagnosis, because he laughed and told me to suspend my disbelief until he explained the differences between type I and type II. As far as the depressive part of the symptoms, it seems fitting -- I've had depression since I was young, I have recurring bouts, I don't respond to medication, self-isolation, social anxiety, etc. The thing that I don't quite understand is the hypomania. I don't know if I've just been stuck in this depression so long that I don't really remember feeling elevated or hyper, or if I've never had any instances of it.


I've had periods in my life where I was more social than others and I felt more energized, but I thought that was just ""normal"". I do feel hyper occasionally, but it usually coincides with caffeine intake or feeling adrenaline when it's especially busy at work. This energy only lasts a couple hours and my bouts of being social and partying last only two or three months. Is that hypomania?


I want to get better -- at this point, I NEED to get better, because I really can't take that much longer of feeling dead inside. My psychiatrist prescribed 5mg of Abilify and Lamictal, but I don't remember the dosage of that. I'm tapering off Wellbutrin and I start taking these new medications tomorrow morning. I just feel like I'm at the mercy of mental health care professionals at this point; I don't know any better to say I don't or do have a mood disorder, I just have to hope he's right. All I can think is what if this medication makes me psychotic? Abilify was one of the medications my friend was on when he overdosed and died, so I'm already leery of that one.

On Wednesday my psychiatrist recommended that I take 100 one day and 200 the next, and so on. I started that on Wednesday. So I took 100 Wednesday and 200 today. I can feel the difference.


The floaty feeling is very much lessened, it's still slightly there. I was very hypomanic today. Very efficient at work. Things looked beautiful. I was sociable.


Now I feel this sort of down type feeling. You know, where you feel like crying over tiny things. Things are uninteresting. Apathy about it. Blah blah blah.

Also turns out she had been diagnosed a couple times before with bipolar and just rejected the diagnoses. Knowing what I know now, a LOT of things make sense in hindsight.

**Further explanation**

I don't know why, but meds often work great in the beginning and then abruptly and/or rapidly stop working or go south. Seroquel, Risperdal, various SSRIs, Benadryl for sleep, Klonopin, a bunch of other antidepressants. I was prescribed Lamictal 2.5 years ago and it got rid of my suicidal lows and reduced my depressive episodes for a while, plus there were no side effects I could perceive, which was delightful. I got back on it in November after a 10 month break (the break was started by a disruption in life schedule) because I could feel myself sinking. A while later I got freaked out by a rash, thus stopped, and then plummeted into downing a bottle of Ativan with alcohol the next day. So the meds must have had some positive effect if not being on it made life horrid, right? 

I don't know if this recent development means that the Lamictal is no longer effective or that I need to raise the dose from 300 mg. I'm 98 pounds and have had interesting reactions to an array of different medications (e.g. hallucinations from Seroquel, panic attack from a non-SSRI that's supposed to treat anxiety). I also have some disordered eating issues; if I started gaining weight from another pill I might stop taking it and probably cease eating and/or purge and start smoking like a chimney and even possibly seek drugs that have a reliable side effect of killing appetite. I called the outpatient clinic and they told me they'd call back within two weeks but they haven't. I'm considering ramping up to 350 mg without consultation but I don't know. Suggestions? 

Mid-late May, my boyfriend broke up with me because of the worst depressive episode I've ever had that happened despite being on medication. He had put up with me for seven months; numerous suicidal ruts, self-harm, belligerence that caused a lot of fights, mostly legal substance abuse, and two breakups. After this last breakup I attempted suicide by blood loss instead of overdose because I thought overdosing was too unreliable. Ironically the knife at my disposal was a utility knife with a flimsy 23 year old blade, so overdosing would actually have been more feasible. 

I've recently noticed that when I'm intensely depressed my memory gets a little fuzzy, and the aforementioned episode was accompanied by an erase of a day and a half. The few fragments I remember are scarily dream-like to the point that I somehow recall observing myself from an external point of view. But what really terrifies me is how I behaved during this amnesia. I was apparently a complete and utter asshole. Now I don't know if I should--no, *can*--divorce the disorder from my personality. I can't excuse this shit on being bipolar. That'd make me an ever worse asshole. 

It doesn't seem unlikely that I'll ultimately take my own life; it'd be easier to do it ""while I'm ahead"" instead of waiting for everyone to leave me because I'm terrified of dying alone. Yet not wanting to hurt others is the only thing holding me back, which means I'd have to be completely alone anyway. I'm so conflicted and lost.

Sick to my stomach. Lethargy. And definitely the worst depression hole I have ever felts, not including a few of my most serious episodes in my life. 

It is literally the worst. And it is why I have the notion that my medications are ""holding me hostage"". The paradox is, I know I need them, and they help me function. It sucks. 

In the beginning of my senior year of college I had been feeling great that summer and decided to start reducing my medicines with my psychiatrist. Started slowly tapering down the Lamictal from 300mg to 200mg; and then started Cymbalta from 60 mg to 30mg over about 3 weeks. Shit really hit the fan. I went crazy. Terrible depression and mood swings and mixed episodes. It was terrible for a few weeks. 

The silver lining, however, was this was the point in my life where I had a realization/confirmation, or an epiphany. I always had some doubt that I may not even have an illness, maybe was just weak or faking it. I always planned to completely be off my meds by the end of college. I had to accept the fact that I will probably be on medication for most of my life, and do have a mental disorder that I have to deal with.

I can accept that I may be ADHD also but it scares me to accept that I am not bipolar and go on to ADHD meds instead just because the therapists office I go to specializes in ADHD.  I've been on meds since I started seeing them, so I'm thinking that is probably why they aren't diagnosing me with bipolar--  bc my meds are working.  What happened to me was a definite manic episode, and through research I haven't found any other explanation for one other than bipolar.  I don't want to have to have another manic episode before my therapist get's their ego out of the way and explores my past symptoms and the possibility I'm bipolar.

Well, after a long depressive, I have finally come out of it as of a few weeks ago. I had a bought of mania a few weeks ago, and I went to see my doctor. She adjusted my lithium and all that medical stuff they do, and things got back to normal. The past couple of days, however, I have been getting progressively more manic, sleeping only a couple hours a night, racing thoughts, irritable, the works. The only good thing about all this was that none of it was geared toward my boyfriend, with whom I live.

Until tonight. We went outside to smoke a cigarette and started talking about life and how I wanted to be a writer, but I'm struggling because I feel that my medicine inhibits my abilities and all that stuff. Well, at some point, he said the wrong thing (I honestly can't even remember what), and I just snapped. I told him that he had been emotionally deceptive and dishonest with me, that he never let me in, that he didn't understand my struggle, and so on. I really laid into him. All of the sudden, it clicked what was happening, and I just blurted out, ""I know I'm manic, and I know I'm being irrational, but I can't help it!""

So we are good, as he is very patient and knew this would happen eventually. I actually think he expected it to be worse, which it normally is, so thank the universe or the gods or whatever for that. I'm just frustrated. I love him so much, and I don't want him to ever be the target of my manic anger because it's so relentless and irrational. I know he is strong and says he doesn't care; he loves me nonetheless. But I can't help but think that eventually he will get tired of it and I leave. I mean, I was depressed for months (a functional depression, not the bedridden kind) with a few really rough days interspersed, but mania is a whole different animal. And a lot more destructive.

I guess I just needed somewhere to let all this out. If you have any advice that would be great, but honestly, I'm just thankful to have someone listen (or read).",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Anyways, I went to visit my doctor because I was still feeling very depressed.  My doctor was being a dick from the get go.  Told me there wasn't much he could do, then accused me of trying to con my way to get amphetamines because I told him I was having difficulty focusing.  After all that, he upped my dosage of Rameron and Effixor to the highest possible.  He told me the only other option would be a combo of zoloft and welbutrin.  Then he said, it probably wouldn't work on me because Rameron and Effixor work better.

I've tried welbutrin in the past.  It puts my tics on hyper mode to the point where I'm hurting myself.  So that medication is out of the question.  My doctor said if I want anything else, I should go see a private doctor because he's not going to prescribe anything else.

So here's my problem.  I'm without insurance, I'm unemployed and I live in Texas.  Since Texas was one of the 12 states that denied federal funding for obamacare, I can't get my insurance subsidized.  I can't see a private doctor, and I can't go to therapy.  I'm currently seeing a doctor through a program in my city.  They do offer therapy and I tried it for several weeks but it was terrible.  I've had good therapy before that has helped, this one did not.

So what can I do at this point?  Move to another state?  But with what money?  I'm at a road with a dead end.  I don't know what to do.  I've always been able to get myself out of shitholes, but since the depression hit, I can't seem to drum myself to do anything.  Any suggestions?

Edit:  I forgot to mention that there has been a dramatic improvement in my mental health since I started the meds.  Something just doesn't feel right as I still feel sad most of the time, I can't focus, I'm miserable and I have no motivation to change it.","['nsubj', 'dobj']",1,neu_vader

Mom agreed to take me back and the daughter came with me, mom loves her so that helped.

Well, not so much. My friends want to hang out and then they dont follow through. I have friends who live out of town and they will make plans and then... just... nothing. It seems as if my life right now is just me, mom, and the daughter. I dont go out with friends, I go to therapy, i go to group, i go to the dr, and I take kid to school and back.

I dont want to hurt her feelings, but I cant be open and honest with my mental health friends who i have known for a decade, and i feel sooooo isolated right now. 

I had a friend from out of town who wanted to hang out tonight and I was soooooo excited, and now she has cancelled and I am just... devastated. I have other out of town friends who have promised to hang and then cancelled last minute or just never contact me when they say they will. I lost friends from church so i dont go out anymore.

I'm having huge problems even leaving her alone for one day, much less one night. but I believe i'm being 1million percent honest as a human can be when I say that all I care about is that I know she takes her meds.

she doesn't really know anyone but me. she occasionally talks to her little sister and mom on the phone but they're 40+ miles away from her with no way of getting to her.

i dont know how else to describe my concern for her, but if I could, i would ask her to transform all the love she once had for me and use it to have her start taking her meds.

she blocked me from our main text chat communication. her phone has been broken for a month, so i can't call her. I already bombarded her with emails last night about taking her meds which led to the blocking.

i can drive over and see her anytime in person, but she told me she feels seeing me in person clouds how she really feels about me.

My uncle is Bipolar I and he is 54 years old now. He's never been treated in his life and had a very tough childhood. I'm not very close to him but we are family. He is a writer and many times he would explain to me how his work is greater than the bible. This would go on for a while and then he would disappear into his room. It would cycle between this and I was 12 when he was living with me and my mother. I didn't think much of it at the time. 6 years later, now that I've been diagnosed with depression, I somewhat understand what he was going through. I emailed him recently and he is very delusional. He believes that his work will soon bring him great fame and prosperity and that meds will dilute his thoughts and creativity. Maybe he enjoys his mania and it fuels his life? I want him to know that if he seeks treatment he could get a job and help his family again. Am I right? What do you think? At this point, is his condition untreatable?

For almost a year now I have been taking Seroquel XR and my life has improved greatly. I have a direction for my life, my grades have improved and im on track to graduate community college with a general AA this year. I've learned a lot of discipline and  I feel better about myself. At least more than I did a year ago. However, I think I need to change my meds. About once a week my thoughts start screaming at me and I'm wracked with anxiety and stress. I don't know if this is simply something natural for someone my age to go through, or the pills aren't working anymore. 

A little background for why I think this could be just something natural or normal. I'm going to give a shot at a 4 year university for a BA in business. The fear of the unknown is pretty nerve wracking. The second major issue is my dad is dating again. My mom died to cancer when I was 12 and I still love and miss her. She was in pain for many years, so im glad she is no longer in pain and I have accepted her death. However, every time I see my dad with another woman I get this gut wrenching feeling and utter hate towards the woman that my dad is dating. Regardless of if she makes him happy. Its been half a decade and it's natural and fair for him to want to share his life with someone. I don't know what's normal, but I'm pretty sure a ""Sane"" person would be affected by this.

Now for why I think I might need additional help with a change in medication. What I'm going through is trying and stressful, but I feel the bipolar is magnifying it and at times it feels like a little more then I can handle. The only thing keeping me from flying off the walls at the moment is the woman I love and a project I picked up to eat some of my time.  My relationships with my friends are degrading by my change of mood as well.

Bottom line is I need some advice from people I trust, and by god I trust this subreddit. You guys and gals have been amazing in the past and If anyone can help set me straight it would be this community.

I'm in a scenerio where natural events are running their natural course and it's taking its toll on me, or these events are signifying my meds are no longer working how they are intended to. Should I ride out the storm or seek additional help?","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

For the first week I'm suppose to take 250 of the depakote to see how I react and possible side effects. I can't say I'm reacting or not and have no side effects except a dry mouth. 


The klonopin worked it's magic really quickly - when I felt my racing thoughts coming on they quickly subsided, my irrationality ceased, and overall I'm not as anxious as I had been. 

I am suppose to wait a week before taking the depakote twice a day (am/pm) but I wonder if I should just start now as I haven't had a bad effect from it. When I went to the pdoc I was in a mixed state and still am I believe just not as severe. I still can get pretty talkative and it appears exhausting for others to listen to.

My depressive episodes are very polarized from my normal behavior so it's very simple for me to tell that side. 

If I can tell I'm having hypomania I can usually put up precautions (ex. only allowing myself to order online so I can cancel the orders when I am in a calmer state, having friends hold my things for me). 

I usually get triggered by spending time out with my friends if I haven't seen them in a while due to a mixture of lots of anxiety that quickly turns into excitement/happiness. It's very hard for me to tell if I'm just having fun or it's the beginning of something nasty. From then on everything is racing thoughts and hyperactivity so I can't tell what's going on until a week or so has passed. Apparently it's also not noticeable to people I know too, when I point it out they can tell when the episode is over but otherwise they can't tell the difference so I can't ask them for help unless I know. And there have been times where I am just very excited and it wears off. 

I have gone through the long grueling process of determining the best fit for medications and the one I currently take has things under control for me. I know that medications aren't perfect though so I should get to know when I'm having hypomania so I can prepare for it in the future if/or when it happens.

I started at 100mg Lamotrigine, bumped up to 150mg for about 6 months, then up to 200mg for 3-4 months, and now I'm down to 175mg. The apathy invested itself during my 200mg phase, and even in bumping down it hasn't decreased as much as I was hoping. 

I know medication is necessary to feel 'sane.' I know that it helps me. But what if I'm really okay? What if my unmedicated self is better? I need vibrancy in my life, but how can I take that back without risking my own life and my responsibilities?  ",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Before that I had intermittent periods of depression with add which I took anti-depressants and Ritalin for. I was doing pretty well. Then I started getting bad stomach pain for over a year and finally went to the doctor to have a camera put down my throat to look at my esophagus and stomach. The anesthesia used was propofol. It's supposed to be a sort of amnesic and puts people to sleep. When I woke up, I felt bad. I couldn't eat or sleep anymore. Then the next day I was talking to my bf and something triggered me to have a physical hallucination. I fell on the floor and started re-enacting the rape and strangulation of a little girl. I started choking at the end like someone had Their hands on my throat and I literally was trying to breathe. I closed my eyes after and saw a white leg from the dead body of a little girl. It was almost like I saw it before because it really scared me. When I opened my eyes I was dizzy like I had a seizure. I completely lost my sense of reality and went into a psychosis (paranoia, delusions). I was put into a mental hospital a few days later, after my mom called the police, as I was acting like a zombie pretty much. From then on I had the worst depression of my life for the next 8 months. I got better gradually but the year after I also was talking to my mom about something and the strangle thing happened again followed by crying. My mom again wanted me to go to the mental hospital, but I said I was fine. It's like every time it happens my body takes control of my mind. Because there is no memory associated with it, I feel shaken up but ignore it. This year I was very dissociated (feeling like i am removed from my own body) to the point where I couldn't work for a few months. I would get angry or cry for no reason at the littlest things. I take bipolar medication which helps a little, but I'm always afraid of losing control of my body and re-living something horrible that never happened to me. Is this normal for bipolar? The meds help, but all I've had as far as ""mania"" goes is suffering from someone else's trauma. I hate it. I wish I could have ""normal"" mania instead of feeling like another person who's not me. :/ does anyone else have this? I feel so weird and sometimes wonder if the little girl was me, but even if it was, the only memory that exists is triggered at random and the only ""memory""  is in my body, not my mind. If it really did happen to ME, I'm really glad I don't know about it because I've suffered enough as it is.","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

I knew up front that she was bipolar and she also suffers from anxiety and PTSD. She hasn't been on her meds for about 4 months now, mainly because we don't have insurance and we can't afford any of her meds (we've tried medicaid, disability, and those free med programs with no luck), but also because she doesn't like how the meds make her feel. So she smokes weed to help stabilize her mood. 

I love her more than anything, we have such an amazing connection and this is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. Lately though, things have been a little rough. She doesn't work, she can't drive because of anxiety issues, and lately she has been in a downswing and can barely take care of herself. I have been trying to step up but there is only so much I can do. I work 40+ hours a week, I drive her an hour away two or three times a week so she can visit with her son, I do all the cooking, all the cleaning, all the driving and shopping and I am just burnt out. I'm so fucking exhausted trying to take care of everything while she sits in bed and smokes weed and reddits. 

And I just don't know how much longer I can keep going on like this. Money is tight, I am considering getting a second job or selling some of my music equipment just to make ends meet. I'm mentally and physically exhausted and I keep hoping she will snap out of it and at the very least help out around the house. 

We've had the same argument multiple times. It always revolves around me asking her for help but nothing ever changes. 

I'm at a point where I just don't know what to do. I love her so much, and I have been patient and kind and understanding towards her, but if I continue with this lifestyle its only a matter of time before I snap. I am taking on too much responsibility and its starting to really effect me in a negative way. I'm constantly stressed out and overwhelmed with the amount of shit I have to do everyday.

END EDIT

It seems pretty obvious to me after doing some thought, research, and discussion that medication is a temporary fix for bipolar. That it usually resurfaces. That the meds might be making it worse. The implications of this are only now sinking in. I wonder what the medication is really doing to my brain, whether I really have the strength to endure a relapse after finally seeing what it's like to live without symptoms. I don't want to lose who I am now. I don't want to fall into the abyss for the old me to take my place. I fear what deep shit he'll get me into if/when he gets out. Is there even any point in finishing my college degree? How will I do anything good or significant with my life if it's always a battle against the rage, hatred, depression, and insanity that are dwelling within me like a timebomb?

I'll stuff this away or make peace with it in time; I keep telling myself that today everything is fine. But damn... It's not like turning away from the big, scary questions about life has ever been my strong suit. How do you all deal with it? I've only had 7 years of experience with bipolar and I know this community has collectively been dealing with bipolar a lot longer than I have...

&gt;Before the lovely opiate

&gt;Will send me to the grave?

&gt;Who fashions men like me?

&gt;An angry boy with broken toys

&gt;And I'm his masterpiece?

Something has been different about my brother for a long time - bursts of energy followed by a week of silence and anger, moodiness for no particular reason, sleeping half the day, etc. He was diagnosed with severe bipolar disorder a few years ago. 

Since then, tons has happened - he dropped out of school, lost the job he got after dropping out, seriously injured himself....it goes on and on. 

Here's the problem - he doesn't seem willing to help himself. We had to beg, and I mean BEG, to get him to talk to a professional. When he's meeting with doctors or psychiatrists, he lies, and obviously there's no way to know exactly whats going on in the meetings due to doctor/patient confidentiality. He's specifically been told that he can't drink when he's taking his medication (otherwise many of the calming effects will be cancelled out), but he does anyway. 

He's been at home with my parents since he dropped out of school. I live nearby, but I have a full time job, a wife, a kid on the way, and we might be moving - I can help when he has his severe downswings, but not as often as I'd like to. Over the past few years, since he dropped out of school and moved back home, I've seen the toll it's taken on my parents. Obviously, our priority is helping him, but his self destructive behavior is completely draining them of all their energy and happiness. They're solidly middle class, and since he keeps losing his jobs they're helping him pay for everything he needs - it's a strain. They've paid his bail more than a few times. They haven't had a proper holiday in years because they're afraid to leave him alone - in addition to being bipolar, he's a party animal, and would likely tear the house apart if they left for a weekend away at the seaside. They're in their late 40s, but lately have started looking and carrying themselves as if they're in their late 60s. It's absolutely heartbreaking to watch - they were such amazing parents to me when I was a kid, and now they deserve a break. They're not likely to get one any time soon. We were supposed to take our first vacation as a family in years last weekend - we had to cancel it at the last second and lost hundreds of dollars in flights and hotels because he suddenly got angry about something and refused to go. 

I could go on and on, but here's my question - at what point can a person not be helped unless they want to help themselves, and am I a bad brother for thinking it and saying it? Myself and some of my extended family (aunts, cousins) have been trying to convince my parents that they need to set some sort of ultimatum for him with the drinking - if his meds worked properly and without interference, it would be a whole different ball game. Some sort of deadline to stop drinking, some sort of system of accountability, some sort of financial cutoff if he doesn't hold on to a job - but they're good parents. They can't handle the idea of shoving their kid out of the boat and making him swim. 

I so desperately want to help him, and them. I'm not even sure if I have a question or need a definitive answer. It's just so infuriating that we can't have a normal family. At this point, I'm not sure if my kids are going to have an uncle - I don't know if I want him in their lives. At my wedding, I couldn't ask him to be my best man because I didn't know if he'd bail on me or do something stupid and ruin things. I just don't know what to do. I want my brother back, I want my family back, I want my parents to have their lives back.

When I tell him I don't want to lose my hair he says I'm Gonna lose it sooner or later. Whenever I mention lamictal he always says no because it's not indicated for bipolar and does nothing for the highs.
Not to mention the countless times he's outright lied or contradicted himself, of the 2 years I've seen him he's done it about 6 times, either he's contradicted himself or /r/Psychiatry have pointed out the truth. 

He has a reputation at multiple hospitals for being the best psychiatrist but what he's best at is lying and that's what I've concluded is necessary for patient compliance which is a big thing in psychiatry because the meds are shit.

He said you've only got a week left so just keep your shit together until then. And that's exactly what I need to do. I have a lot of stuff I need to get done that I should be doing right now and I just can't bring myself to get up to do it. I'm crying at random times for no fucking reason at all. I made myself oatmeal this morning because I hadn't eaten in like 40 hours and I still wasn't hungry but I knew I had to eat and it took like 45 minutes to finish a damn bowl of oatmeal because I kept randomly crying into my fucking apples and cinnamon with raisins oatmeal.

I hope writing this all down will help but I still can't get through a sentence without crying, it's ridiculous. I hate being like this. I hate feeling useless and not getting anything done. The meds I'm on have been a godsend and we probably need to up the dose, my next appt is May 5. 

I **have** to work on student teaching portfolio today. It's due tomorrow, I think there's some flexibility on that, but I've done almost no work on it. But I have negative motivation and just want sink into the floor and disappear. I get suicidal thoughts when I'm like this. I've never attempted and don't think I would, but it's more like, I just can't deal with this anymore and don't what to do and that would be a relief. But I know this is temporary. I've been through this before and it will get better. It's been great these past 3 months I've been student teaching. So I know it can be like that again. Logically and rationally, I know this. But I'm not thinking logically or rationally right now and I just feel like hopeless. 

I'm not sure what I'm looking for here. I think what I need is just to know that someone understands what I'm going for and at the same to tell me to get up and go get some work done, don't waste this day just sitting around.

My bp2 diagnosis is still new, 9 months ago, so I'm still getting used to recognizing hypomanic episodes. Looking back now, and especially with this sudden depression, I think I may have been hypomanic these past few months. I'm not sure, it's something I'll bring up with my pdoc my next appt.","['pobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

I basically called my friend a bitch and a cheating cunt last night while drunk (the most I've ever been). It was supposed to be a stress-free night that ended with both sides raging at each other and her crying. Goddammit. 

I was incredibly stupid in my reasoning for feeling that way. Something little set me off and I went from happy-go-lucky, to depressed, to angry, back to depressed, then back angry before I let her have it. I can't seem to be happy. I can't seem to stop myself from taking out my hate for myself on others, especially the ones I love. I excel at pushing people away. Now I might lose another friend who's been nothing but helpful and understanding because I made a stupid decision and let something little and stupid get to me. 

I want to be the best friend I can be for this girl, because she's been the same for me, but I'm my own worst enemy in this endeavor, and I have no idea why other than I hate myself. I hate the fact that I feel like a failure. I hate the fact that I can't seem to stand up for myself or be assertive. I hate the fact that when I do, it ends up hurting people and pushing them away. I hate the fact that my life is a big steaming pile of shit. I hate the fact that I have the emotional maturity of a five year old. I hate the fact that I can't maintain any meaningful relationship. I hate the fact that I never learned to control myself. I hate the fact that I feel like I'm set in my ways. I hate the fact that life has made me bitter. I hate the fact that I just might end up like my dad: bitter, stuck in a job I hate, and just settling for what I can get. I hate the fact that every time I try to make a change, I can't seem to keep that change going. I hate the fact that if I do have change, it's almost immediately taken away from me by my own hand or by circumstance. I hate the fact that I seem to be subconsciously seeking approval, love, and affection in all the wrong places. Finally, I hate the fact that I hate myself.

On top of all that, my meds keep me from really releasing any emotion. I'm deadpan, and I know I really need to cry or something. I feel like the biggest pile of shit because of what I did, but I can't really feel it. It's frustrating.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Anyway, my insurance wouldn't cover it, and so she wanted me to take Risperidone instead. I didn't see her, though. The receptionist just called me and told me that's what my doctor wanted me to do. So, I picked up the prescription, but after doing research and talking to people... I was not comfortable taking it. At all. Especially without talking to my doctor first about my concerns. So I did not take the Risperidone. For many reasons.

First of all, I'm not down with the possible irreversible movement disorder thing. And then there's the part where it can make you practically hibernate. I have a friend who was recently on it and she could not function. I did not want to take that risk. I am already having a hard time functioning, but I'm getting by. And I need to keep getting by, because I need a fucking job and money and shit. And the last reason was weight gain. I'm recovering from an eating disorder, but I'm not recovered. I cannot gain over a certain amount of weight, or I WILL be triggered back into my eating disorder. I hate seeming so sure of that, but I'm already at a pretty high weight. Stability is extremely important for me, though.

Anyway. I wasn't going to take it. So, I had to make it through the past week. And it's been pretty fucking awful. I have NOT been sleeping. Last night I slept an hour and a half. On Monday, I calculated how many hours I had slept since the previous Monday... and out of 180 hours, I had only slept 34. The night before last I managed to get 7 hours, but then last night... nope. So on top of not sleeping, I was  extremely energetic and anxious and depressed all at once. I was physically exhausted, I could tell. My body was barely chugging along, but I couldn't feel it. I was running myself ragged, but I physically couldn't do anything about it. 

Today I finally got to see my doctor again, and I flat out told her everything that had been going on, and that I did not take the Risperidone. I was not comfortable. And the medication I wanted to try and would be most comfortable starting off with would be Lamictal. After talking about it for awhile, she agreed that it would be a good fit. There is one very scary side effect, but it's so extremely rare, and can be prevented if you get help IMMEDIATELY once noticing the symptoms. So she prescribed me that. And I started taking it tonight. The pill is so fucking small! It's cute. She also gave me 7 Ambien, because I need to sleep or I'm literally going to just drop dead from exhaustion. I'm aware that it's addictive. But I want to sleep regularly every night more than I want to get high off of it. 

So, I'm very relieved. I am optimistic about Lamictal. Being comfortable with what I'm taking is going to make it a lot easier for me to not be super stressed all day. I'll be able to focus on getting a job, too, instead of being too tired to move. But there is one problem. I'm also on Wellbutrin and Paxil right now. My doctor wants me to stay on the Wellbutrin, but come off the Paxil. Because... this is what she said, I'm dead serious:

*People don't have bipolar disorder AND anxiety disorders. They have one or the other.*

Um, what the fuck? NO. I told her I didn't disagree. And she wants me to go down on my Paxil and eventually come off of it, but I am not going to. I told her why. Paxil completely changed my life. Instead of being bipolar AND having EXTREMELY BAD anxiety symptoms.. I was able to mostly only have bipolar. I used to have panic attacks every single day. Multiple times. They would make me physically ill. I had to take the bus to and from school, and I would often puke on the bus. It was so embarrassing. But I had no other choice? I have been diagnosed with GAD, and I have pretty severe social anxiety. But the Paxil has helped me SO MUCH. I do NOT want to go back to that. I can't. And also, I told her how fucking terrible the withdrawal was... but she didn't seem to believe me. Like, she just doesn't understand how terrible it is. I'm just not coming off of my Paxil. I see my new Psychiatrist in less than two weeks. I will talk to her about it, and she will understand. If she thinks something else might be better, I might consider it. But I really think she'll want me to stay on it if it's managing my anxiety so well.

Anyway... I'm feeling okay right now. I feel like the Lamictal may have already mellowed me out a tiny bit. It's just made me kind of tired, but not overly tired, so my brain feels like it's able to slow down a bit. I dunno, though. I could just be crashing. I'm kind of scared to take the Ambien because I don't wan to have hallucinations. But overall... I'm hopeful. This is the worst episode I have ever had. It's probably not even over yet, but for about a month now, I've just been fucking insane. This is my first time being treated for bipolar with a mood stabilizer. And... to think that it could help me feel normal, or at least slightly normal? I want to know what that feels like. I have a friend who is on Lamictal, and she has been for years. Her bipolar is pretty much managed. I want to have that. I've been bipolar for most of my life, and it's just been getting worse and worse because it's been untreated. I want things to get better.

Also, I may have found a good job opportunity that might work out. It's the best prospect I've had in awhile, so I'm hoping it will work out well. I need money so bad... it's not even funny. I can't even think about it. What's even worse, is I fucked myself over so bad in school last year. I either got A's, or I failed. Because I was either able to do the work, or I was not. My family doesn't know I'm bipolar. They really don't support me very much. I might tell them this week. But, they think I fucked up last year because I was lazy, when really, I was barely getting by because I was losing it so frequently. So they won't let me use my college funds to pay for school. Because of my GPA, I'm not eligible to apply for Financial Aid. So until I somehow raise my GPA, I can't be on Financial Aid. Which means I need to find another way to pay for school. I have no fucking idea how. I might get a student loan, but I have bad credit. I just hate what this disease has done to me. But I feel positive about overcoming it for the first time, despite being in a complete shit hole at the moment.

I grew up in a single parent house with 6 children with a mother who lived with a schizophrenic abusive boyfriend. I often had experiences of him attempting to kill us/my mom/hitting my sisters.

I spent a lot of time living with my uncle who would use food as a tool to starve me, making me sleep outside.

I was sexually abused by a family friend for about a year while I was 10/11 years old.

I spent a lot of time in and out of care 

I first attempted suicide at the age of 15, then 16, then 17
My mum said I was doing it for attention. My school sent me to have therapy - mom discouraged it and eventually I stopped going and fell off the radar. 

I started assigning my 'depressive' emotions to events, often imagining situations to explain why I felt so awful. ""I must feel bad because I didn't very well on that test"" ""I must feel bad because I'm lacking in this, or that""
I moved out at 18, I work full time outside of college and its strange, because in a way, its made me really successful. I am very hardworking, I am not intelligent, but I work hard. I have scholarships for university studying science, I get sponsorships for a variety of things, people think I am the most well rounded person. People say they have never met such a happy person, people love being around me. No one knows I've had bi-polar for 6 years, no one knows I've been abused.

But I've been successful from keeping my distance. Its strange because the closer I get to someone, the worse my mood swings become. The more I start to day-dream. The closer I get to someone, the more they say that 'I lie' that 'Im delusional' and of course I panic

I often get anxiety and what can be described as realistic day dreams. I'm unable to physically sleep alone, I avoid going home as long as possible simply to avoid sleeping. I will do double, triple shifts at work, I'll stay in the library revising until 3am. I'm scared to go to bed in case I start thinking

- I;ve always controlled it by having a very strict routine and keeping very busy. I've never sought medical help before but I recently met a guy and started getting very close. He knows I have this and he tries to be understanding but I know its hard on him.

I feel like I'm incapable of holding a relationship and I don't want to be this way. I started seeing a psychiatrist and Im going to start drugs soon but its all very scary.

Will the medication 'fix' this?
Will I stop being such a roller-coaster?
Will it stop me being so successful?

They said that after a while a certain medicine has no effect on them. Im not sure at the point which it stopped helping and they stopped taking cross. 

About 3 months ago they had a huge passion for life. They had their goal and were hell bent on reaching it but they seemed really happy. We were having troubles as friends so contact was sparse in the 3 months.

We hung out about 3 weeks ago and that's when I first noticed they were sort of talking a lot without stopping. The next day they called me and I noticed a few more tendencies. So I had my suspicions and they turned out to be correct, they weren't on medicine. 

The next few weeks were struggle for the person because their parents wanted to medicate them but my friend felt they could manage the condition without it. However should my friend want to keep living at home they would have to take the meds. My friend tried leaving home for about a week but couldn't do it and had to return home. 

My friend said the meds would dull her emotions and take away the ability to feel. Yesterday was my friend's first day taking a pill and I went to visit. Her demeanor was completely different. Her passion for life was completely gone in a span of less than 36 hours. She says all her feeling will be gone soon and that she'll change completely. Laughter will be gone, happiness, sadness, affection, the works.

It was really sad to see someone who the day before was laughing and more excited about life than anyone I've ever met, to not caring about anything whatsoever.  She says everything she loved about life no longer matters to her anymore because there's no point. I was fighting tears my whole time there and even now my eyes are watery. 

The point of this post is mostly for my own reassurance. Is what she says true? Will my friend as I knew her these past months truly be gone or is this just a depressed episode? I've known them for 7 years when they were on medicine but what she describes sounds nothing like what she was like even 4 years ago. I know it varies based on the individual but I was hoping someone here could shed some light on what's in store in the future and whether there's anything I can do to help my friend.

My psychiatrist and I are unsure if it's a product of the bipolar or if it's its own monster, but I've got a script for Klonopin as needed to try and deal with it. 

First of all, it's not really working. I realized this today when I took my car to get the brake light switch fixed (with the help of my boyfriend because I was afraid I'd get in an accident with them stuck the way they were) and I was ""only"" mildly terrified to talk to the mechanic instead of so afraid to leave my house that I wouldn't bother at all. I mean, okay, that's a pretty big improvement for me but it's still not what I'd call good.

Second, the anxiety is aggravating my bipolar. I get stressed out about something, I proceed to ruminate so it doesn't remit and I don't take anything for it because I don't think it's bad enough to warrant meds, the stress triggers hypomanic symptoms, I finally take a Klonopin so it doesn't escalate from there, the benzo in addition to my other meds does the trick but then I end up in a funk and then the depression makes the anxiety worse and the whole fucking thing starts over again. 

Third, it's affecting my overall ability to function in a pretty big way. I got a job and refused it because I had a panic attack over getting a job. (I lost my job last year... well, I say lost but really I mean ""I quit while manic"" because that's actually what happened) I rarely ever leave my house because I'm too nervous to try most of the time, which makes job hunting and interviews pretty difficult.

So yeah. I've only been taking medication because I live in a small town and there isn't a therapist near me that'll take people without insurance *and* do sliding scale payment. I get my meds free from the county MHMR program, which is good because I couldn't afford treatment at all otherwise. (They also paid for my hospital visits this past year, thankfully.) I know that meds alone don't cut it. I've been trying to cope on my own, but I don't know how much more I can do because the constant anxiety is too much for me and a five-day hospital sponsored crash course in CBT isn't as helpful as you might think.

tl;dr I'm terrified of life and am afraid that my stupid anxiety is going to eventually trigger a full relapse, suggestions are welcome.","['nsubj', 'dobj']",1,neu_vader

But that is weirdly a good thing for me. I feel like before meds my sex drive was overactive (I'm female, just for reference). And not just during hypomania. Even when depressed or when I as young as 12 before I developed BP my sex drive has always been...some might say worrisome. But not even in terms of actual promiscuity (I was actually a very conservative girl for many years) but in the content of my fantasies. For as long as I can remember I've been turned on by the thought of truly hurting and humiliating men. Sometimes the fantasies get extreme; especially with real life guys who have wronged me in some way. I feel like it surpasses simple bdsm role-playing dominance and crosses into malicious and even violent or creepy thoughts..sometimes even sadistic rape fantasies (with me being the aggressor of course). Granted, these aren't the ONLY things that turn me on by any means...but they are the only things guaranteed to turn me on at any time. Luckily it's something I've rarely felt the urge to do when I am with a guy in real life. The most basic, vanilla sexual contact in real life is usually enough to satisfy me. There is only one real life occasion where I stepped over the line a little bit with a guy who wasn't comfortable my aggression. But I think since i'm a 20-something attractive girl (maybe a 7/10), no guy is willing to call me out on this...or maybe has never noticed or cared. Often times they just enjoy what they think is a harmlessly kinky girl and play along. No grown man has ever (and probably will never) see me as a true threat even if/when they discover my depraved fantasies. But that shouldn't be an excuse for my twisted side! It's not a very healthy thing to leave  unchecked. 
So the point is, while these meds haven't eliminated my sex drive in any way, they help to take off that aggressive edge sometimes. I saw a Law and Order episode where they prescribed an SSRI to a rapist/sex addict to curb their appetite. Do you think that's why it helps me? Also I've stopped getting those moments where I'm so turned it hurts and I feel like if I don't fuck something I'm going to die. So that's nice. 
On a different note, I've noticed people who have any hint of mental illness tend to be way more sexually adventurous, diverse, have fetishes, or what have you. Anyone else feel that way? 

Sorry for the novel. It feels good to get off my chest though. Feels like confession.

Edit: Also I feel compelled to mention I had a perfectly nice childhood with zero history of sexual trauma and a very Catholic upbringing. So idk where this perversion came from. ",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Just wanted some first hand accounts. Got diagnosed with BD 2 a few months ago. I am ~16 and probably wont hit puberty for a couple more years at least (thanks dad ;P) so from what i understand my cycles are pretty weird and not quite ""normalized"" yet, so i am not worried too much. 

I think i only have had 2 ""organic"" hypomania's, and they were honestly kind of a letdown. Not as much energy as my cousin led me to believe, they happened pretty far apart, and one lasted 3 days while i cant really pinpoint the other one because it turned into a super rapid cycling mixed episode (which sucked!) 

Anyways, I was told to stop taking them a while back, but for a year or so i had been taking vyvanse for suspected ADHD. If i start to abuse it and pull all nighters it will eventually turn into hypomania, which is usually signaled by heavy breathing, euphoria, body tremors, and overall the easiest way to tell is when i am tired/sick from a comedown and suddenly i get all this natural inner energy that is different from the vyvanse. 

Soooo why tell you all that and ask this? mostly becuase 1. i find it interesting to hear other peoples stories and 2. It helps me sort out my own feelings when i  hear others describe their own emotions.

She’s wonderful in so many ways: She’s the person who makes me smile, laugh, feel joy, feel life in a way that just doesn’t happen nearly as often without her. I’ve felt she is the person I’m meant to be with. She is bipolar though and now I’m trying to understand what to do. I’ve just graduated college, am soon to be without a home (three weeks) as my family moves, and don’t have a job lined up yet. In the meantime she has been rooming with her friends all summer down on our school campus. I need to know what this behavior sounds like because I can’t figure out if the changes are because of me or the bipolarity.
When I met here I learned she was bipolar, ADHD, hypersexual (enjoyed/ needed to have new sexual partners every couple months) and I signed on for the long haul because of the wonder and joy she brought me just when we were friends. She had body image issues (needlessly, literally walking sex appeal),  worked out regularly, was really messy, had trouble at work,  but got her homework and classes done on her own for the most part. She had a lot of social anxiety issues but was able to work through them for the most part and we could always talk and have plenty of time to play. 


Six months into the relationship she experiences her first mixed episode (several months after a medication step-down) and rips me new ones emotionally and socially. I stick with and hope things get better which they did… comparably. Her meds were stepped back up (Lamictal), but she had weekly issues with missing doses before and after the episode. Suddenly all the hypersexuality is gone it seems. Her appetites change vastly but her body image issues finally calm down after an emotional few evenings. Then the first few new partners hit me out of nowhere. Little to no warning each time she finds a couple new guys to hook up with over a couple months while things cool with us. Things improve after a month or two on the stepped up dose. The messiness has increased, she’s a bit more spacey. 


Last few months of the school year roll in and the changes really start coming. The messiness reaches unbearable levels at times (I have a bad habit of enabling and picking up after her), when her ADD meds wear off it’s literally like a kid in a candy store, hyper and uncontrolled with some violence. Suddenly it seems to her that her PMS has lengthened to 1.5 -2 weeks and really begins messing with her emotions. Classes are secure, but she feels nothing but apathy for them and again gets regular assistance from others. Her sexuality diminishes even further and any attempt at even romance is typically met with a roll of the eyes and groan of annoyance. Everything feels like too much. She’s had another mixed episode, at least a two week manic episode, and several weeks’ worth of hypodepression it seems. She says she’s no longer romantically in love with me but wants to keep dating. Some improvement and now another dive off… she tried lying to me about hooking up with two separate guys, her life is falling apart again and she doesn’t seem to really care, and she just has stopped talking to me (sounds like a depressive episode I guess?). 


Folks I’m lost here and could use some words/advice. I may have job in a week or two and I need to honestly figure out if I can take the leap here with her. I feel her lamictal may have stopped working due to how frequently she has missed in the past. Either that or it’s me and if I take the leap and we move in together we may both be screwed. I’m scared, and tired. Constantly tired. I just don’t know if I’ll ever see the person I fell in love with again. Is this the bipolar, or something more?

I was diagnosed bipolar in 2009. First depressed in 2006. Treated with medication in 2009. Medication made me manic. Found a med combo that worked well. Felt better. Stopped taking meds. Had a huge depressed episode involving a lot of self injury and a suicide attempt. Then had a massive manic episode that lasted 6 months. I did a lot of drugs (mostly pot and ecstasy), smoked even more, drank every weekend until the 6 months ended. Had a very long mixed episode up until I decided to go back on meds a few months ago.


Now I am back in treatment and haven't smoked anything since mid December. Haven't drank since late December. Haven't done any hard drugs since last January. 

I am trying my old med combo but it has been causing me so many problems. I tried 150 mg of welbutrin xl. It worked for a bit then crapped out after 3 weeks. Went up to 300 mg of the xl. Had a scary manic episode. My doctor said I should take 200 mg of lamictal and go back down to the 150 mg of welbutrin xl. That didn't work because I'm still feeling super edgy and and paranoid. Doctor said no welbutrin xl until the lamictal starts working.

Before I went off my meds, I was taking 225 mg of welbutrin (non xl) and 200 mg of lamictal. It worked well but I was a lot worse and it was almost 3 years ago. I didn't smoke heavily like I did, didn't drink hardly ever, and had only tried pot once. My question is, do you think my age, time off drugs, smoking and/or drinking/drug abuse influenced changes in regards to my meds?

Tl;dr: current meds aren't working. do you think age, time off drugs(~3 years), drug/alcohol/nicotine abuse, will influence current medication needs?","['compound', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

Out of the entire year I've had 2 instances lasting no more than 1-2 weeks of complete ""normalcy"". Otherwise it was many mixed episodes and shifts from hypomania to depression within a day or two. Sometimes I'd go up one day and down the next, everyday for a week.

Luckily I have tomorrow off, but still, this is stressful and annoying. I've been rapid cycling for a few days now. It used to be all the time and it was unbearable, but now it's annoying.

I got a good promotion at work recently where I ended up with a drastic schedule shift.

I fall asleep at 10 and wake up at 5:30 to drive 45 minutes to work.

The New job is very high stress. It's good because it keeps me busy and stabilizes my hypomania by literally exhausting me, but I'm in a lot of physical pain. Aching muscles, shin splints, etc. Even when I'm not at work I'm fixing problems over the phone and talking to different employees who are reaching out for help because my leadership team isn't as good at having work crises as I am. I'm very tired. I was sent to this store to fix a lot of things that were wrong with it, same with the SM I'm working with. We're trying, but man this store needs help.

Yet I can't sleep. I'm trying to quit smoking, so I have an electronic one, but I want the real thing. I also want taco bell. I want to go for a drive.

My insurance changed. My meds are going from 60 total to over 100 for a bare minimum of the three I absolutely have to have. I'm lucky I have insurance at all, but with my therapy, psychiatry and pills going up with me already living paycheck to paycheck this is really gonna sting.

Anyway, thanks for listening. I appreciate it. I'm just hypomanic and can't sleep.

I've been visiting a sleep treatment/research clinic for 16 months now, I originally came in suspecting [Delayed sleep phase disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder) of at least eight hours (essentially a permanent night owl) but it's most likely progressed to [Non-24-hour sleep–wake disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep%E2%80%93wake_disorder). I should also mention here I am Bipolar II.

Here's where the problem arises, Bipolar is very often entwined with sleep issues as depression is, but my doctor cannot find a study of an actual circadian rhythm disorder mixed with bipolar.  Bipolar causes hyposomnia, insommnia, night terrors, but they are symptoms of that disorder, and it's mixing with my latent and permanent sleep disorder.  We don't know how to treat this combination, I'm obviously not the only one but she has absolutely nothing to go off of and we've just been throwing medications at them to see if there's anything at all that would treat both effectively.  Bipolar medications have sleep side effects, sleep medications have mood side effects... I'm lost.  I'm 22 and I can't work or move out of home until something changes.

On the Bipolar side of meds over the last 16 months I've tried Divalproex (currently on), Citalopram, Bupropion, Lithium (severe manic reaction, I was about to jump off my balcony), Trazodone, Olanzapine (awful weight gain and hair loss, not worth it), Temazepam, and am currently on Lamotragine. A lot of tries.

On the sleep side of meds I've tried light therapy for long periods, melatonin, modafinil (I turned into the undead), Zopiclone (for six months which is extremely dangerous but luckily didn't cause an addiction) and currently use a small dose of Quetiapine but it's beginning to not work.

**tl;dr Has somebody here suffered from a circadian rhythm disorder with their bipolar, have you ever seen or heard of a study of them together, have you found a treatment that helps even a little?** I'd be super appreciative of hearing about any experience you've had, or suggestions from anybody really.","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

I'm 22 btw. However, the antidepressants were exhausting me and weren't working and none of them seemed to work appropriately, I was plagued by weird side effects so she referred me to a psychiatrist who upped the dose at which point I went into a manic tailspin and basically oscillated between sobbing to giggling manically with crazy hypersexuality and just tended to rant about weird things. Needless to say, panicked and concerned during a low period I went in to get help and he switched my medications again dropping the dose of the antidepressant and putting me on a mood stabilizer and we're trying to figure out how I'm doing, but I feel like 90% of my visits have been on working out medication, and that he hasn't spend any time really figuring out whats wrong with me.

I have been one various medicines and dosages for severe depression and anxiety for 7-8 years now, effexor, paxil, ciprolex and now pristiq. I use clonazepam for anxiety when it happens. 

I have not had a steady family doctor for 7+ years and have been seeing walk in physicians for that time in various cities and countries. Im Canadian so many of you may know this cycle. All of the physicians had helped but were certain it was just depression / anxiety. 

I have done CBT, counselling, the lot. 

Now: Recently moods have been cycling very rapidly and I felt my Pristiq has had no effect despite it being pretty good for the first year. I finally managed to get a family GP who has been monitoring me closely, we upped from 50mg to 100mg of pristiq and it made me much worse, crazy mood swings, higs, lows, and very very agressive. 

Had a meeting with my GP and a psychologist and they asked me a whole wack of questions, and have come to the conclusion I need to get a Psychiatric exam as they suspect I have been misdiagnosed which apparently is very common. Being in the creative field, as well as many other predispositions, it makes sense. 

I had thought about it before, but looking into it now, it really makes sense. I dont want to diagnose myself before my official examination, but the bottom line is, the medicines havent been working, maybe a placebo effect, who knows. 

I havent been fully diagnosed with it, but I guess what Im looking for from you lot is, how did you first get diagnosed? what were the signs? have any of you been misdiagnosed and in the same situation as me? What do I do now? how different can things get once my meds will be changed if this is the case? How do you manage?

I was writing a pretty long post this morning and I was gonna explain everything from the past 11 months but after what just happened I've gotta get advice on here now, and worry about the big post later. My bipolar girlfriend just went off on me because I had a problem getting the blender together so I could start it. I used it once 11 months ago and even then I had issues with it, and I've almost never used a blender but all I needed was a minute to look at it, figure out which way it screwed on, and get it going. But I always forget not to initiate with her, and when I started pleading for her to stop and not worry, her intensity tripled. Because she was in a rush out the door, I was trying to screw the motor and blade on quickly, but like always she thought yelling helps instead of walking over and just helping me with it. She eventually did that but was rude every step she took towards me and basically called me an idiot repeatedly in the most genuine disgusting ways possible (I'm a pre-med biology student with a 3.8 gpa, so I'm far from stupid). Her facial expressions are just the worst. I don't know what to do. She literally has two sides to her, and one of them I cannot talk to. She's self destructive, just like me, before I finally realized I had to stop and take control of my illness. We're both diagnosed with bipolar disorder but before I met her I was able to really get a hold of my illness and control it through meditation and thought. Taking a year off of school and doing that I was able to get control and now I'm the nicest, calmest person ever. But seeing her flip with her episodes and say the things she does, pushing me to walk out the door even tho I know she doesn't want me to, it reminds me of my own self destructive past. I haven't left yet. Even tho it's gotten close about every two weeks for 11 months. I'm 26 and she's 22 years old. 

I love her to death. I trust her. Even though she's crazy, its nice knowing what kind of crazy she is, because I know she'll never cheat or lie to me, but she has no problem with treating me like dog shit and then calling me her best friend the next minute. 

And I have experience with bipolar disorder. My father is a doctor, diagnosed bipolar, my sister who is 2 years older than me is bipolar, and I'm diagnosed bipolar, adhd, and oppositional disorder, but my bipolar disorder is not as severe as any of the three mentioned above (even tho it used to be). The way I ""controlled"" mine was by lots of meditation, thinking of all the people I've pushed away and the things I've done.  After awhile I finally realized that I shouldn't regret any of it, be happy I'm alive, be calm, live every day to the fullest, and just keep looking forward. But with this girl, my entire world is crashing. All my patience and virtue I gained has kept me from going into hypo and packing my shit and leave.

But I think it's time that I finally come to terms, take the 2 months of heartache, pack my things, and move back home to finish school. I'm not one for giving up anymore, but I don't think I can physically or mentally continue with this relationship.

I don't know how to get her help. She denies that she's bipolar, she thinks its a nasty word and closes up when I try to talk to her. I told her to do what I do and see it as a strength. She is also A.D.D. and her adderall makes her worse, she shuts herself off, becomes irritable and stubborn, and any love she has goes right out the window. 

The thing I'm most scared about is that she will have to go through the pain and suffering I went through before I finally came to terms with my bipolar disorder. It's sad to think that she is going to have to lose me, and others, to open her eyes one day and realize what she's done. We're a perfect match, but because of her not having control or awareness of her disorder, we're the worst match.

Classes start in a month. I have to figure out if I'm staying here or moving out, but I can't live in the same city as her so I'm fine with moving home to go to school for 5 months until I move back to my old university. If I stay here I run the chances of her sabotaging me, which has happened before in different forms, the most prevalent with her yelling at me for doing homework or studying while she's home. I just wish she was more supportive and nice. She was this past weekend, and it was nice, and it made me realize I didn't wanna leave. But the past 2 days.. added on with all the other bad days, which outweigh the good 3:1, is taking a toll on me in so many ways. And I'm scared to leave her because she doesnt take care of herself and needs me to do so much. I think the reason I've been her longest relationship is because I get a sense of where she's coming from, which is also why I try to not take it to heart, but watching her torment and going through the episodes drains me every day. But what if she ends up with a guy who isn't going to understand that? The stuff she says to me and people in public, and her actions, are scary because one day shes gonna do or say the things to the wrong person and.. it just seriously worries me and makes me feel like I need to stay to protect her.

Sorry that everything is kind of scrambled... I just had to get something written down and see if anyone else has been in the same boat and can help me. I know the fights I mention don't seem bad, but this is literally one of 100,000 (no joke) fights we've had that stem from something so small that you would laugh that its even an issue. Everyone always says ""every girl is crazy"" or ""all girls are like that"" but they don't understand how intense someone with bipolar disorder can get. They say the most hurtful things on purpose. I wish she could control it. Does anyone have any advice? The only medicine she is currently on is adderall xr 30mg, and I honestly thing the doctor misdiagnosed her with A.d.d. instead of discovering her bipolar disorder at an early age. Is there some way I can talk to her? Is there a help line? A book? Anything I can do to reach out to her? 

My summer finals are next week.. so if I were to leave it would be in 1 1/2 weeks and probably during the day when she's at work. I know that sounds horrible but I'm too scared to confront her, I was shaking this morning from her yelling and slamming doors bc of a blender.. yesterday she almost blinded me bc she didnt like something I said. She's hit me in the past; and I'm a big dude but I don't believe in violence. Right now my only option seems to save myself and just leave, block her number, and just pray that she realizes what she did and realizes that you can't and shouldn't treat someone you love this way. That's what I did.

p.s. I'm like the nicest, kindest, most understanding and calm people ever. I fix her breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. I do everything for her, literally everything, laundry, clean the house every 2 days, make the bed, when she gets home I will do whatever she asks. But when something annoys her she can't just put it behind her, she has to ruin the night or morning by thinking about it constantly.. and it's like everything I do has lost any value it had. If she runs out of tampons, she will yell at me for 30 minutes (if i'm lucky its that short) and even while i'm offering to go get some right then and there, she tells me no. It's not supposed to make sense.. bipolar disorder never does, but god.. I love this girl and I just wish she didn't have it.. or could use it to her advantage.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

So the title says it all.

Fast forward to when I can make my own medical decisions, I'm starting to get bad again but I can get meds myself now. The thing is that my mom put these ideas in my head that I for some reason still believe.

I guess my questions are as follows:

2. I'm scared of a numbing effect. How does medication feel?

So, my story isn't unusual, just at a particularly stressful part of it right now and could use some support. I was diagnosed bipolar at age 13 (Mom and sister both are, too, so wasn't a huge surprise), and after almost a decade of working through it without medication, I'm now working with my doctors to start looking at anti-anxiety/anti-depressant meds. 

Anyway, I want to feel excited about taking control and making a move to help myself when I know this is what I need right now, but I am terrified. SO TERRIFIED. I'm scared of taking a medicine that might not work or even make it worse. I'm scared of all of the side effects I've heard about. I'm thinking about it constantly and I haven't even started anything but a low dose of anti-anxiety right now. My boyfriend keeps commenting that he thinks I should feel so much better and more hopeful now, and I don't want to correct him because I feel like that's how I should feel... but I absolutely don't. 

So long story short, I was just hoping to hear some stories/advice/tips/anything about you guys' transitions into taking medication for bipolar and finding the right one(s). Doesn't have to be all sunshine and rainbow stories, just want to (1) not feel so alone in being more scared about this than hopeful and positive and (2) reinforce to myself that medication can do a lot of good and I'm not going through this for nothing.

Recently, after many years of struggling unmedicated, I was finally able to make an appointment with to get back on the wagon. I'm very lucky that my therapist is an APN, and so once a week she has collaborative hours with a psychiatrist where she can prescribe medications (in some states APNs don't need to collar., where I'm from they do). This is excellent, in my opinion, since she knows a lot of the ins and outs of what goes on in my head and what medications would be helpful.

A bit of background, my current diagnosis is bipolar NOS (rapid cycling, extended mixed episodes), EDNOS (really, anorexia - binge/purge subtype, but my weight is all over the place and i still have menstrual cycles), and strong borderline tendencies. 

Because of the eating disorder, my APN knows that obviously I do not want to take something that has weight gain as a prominent side effect. Because of this, she prescribed trazodone for sleep and Saphris to help control the mixed episodes and anxiety. 

That being said, because it only comes brand name for now, Saphris is super expensive. I'm lucky enough that I'm still covered under my parents' insurances, but outside of that, I'm completely self supporting. This being said, from your experiences, is Saphris worth the money? 

I know full well everyone reacts differently to every medication, which is why i want to hear everything. The good, the bad, the ugly! :D

Currently her meds are set at 12.5mg Lamictal and 75mg Zoloft. She's extremely medication-sensitive--especially when drowsiness or nausea are listed side effects.

Yesterday we went to see her new psychiatrist (they seem to come and go at community health clinics), who initially said that she's on a sub-therapeutic dose of Lamictal and then recommended raising the dose. We opted against it at this time, in large part because the cocktail seems to be working just right to stabilize her moods without impacting creativity or generally getting in the way of life. She was on 25mg for a month and experienced constant confusion, and lamented that she had no creativity at all.

She's been on 12.5mg for about two months now, and it's been super effective (other than the fact that the damn pills like to shatter when we cut them). When I looked into the dosing later, I find out that she's basically at only 1/16th of the recommended dose of Lamictal for bipolar. Strange. Though the dosing chart did make no distinction between bipolar I, II or cyclothymia.

I guess what I need to take away from this is that there are no hard and fast rules for dealing with mental illness, and that what works is what works, I guess. Does anyone else have experience with managing bipolar symptoms with sub-therapeutic dosing?","['nsubj', 'npadvmod']",1,neu_vader

I graduated college in May and had to move back in with my family (minus the father and one of my sisters) and since then, I've gotten in 2 fights with my brother, 3 with sister B, and one with sister A (3 sisters, one brother), as well as 2 with my mother.

I can 100% honestly say that the only part I had in these fights was standing up for myself. Standing down is shown as a weakness, and these fights strongly resemble schoolyard fights.

Long story short, the only one I haven't fought with is sister C. She is the *only* one that doesn't treat me like I'm a lesser person, and she's only 13. Though, unfortunately, she does partake in the family's most exciting hobby: talking about me behind my back.

They accuse me of being unstable, lashing out, defensive, psychotic, neurotic, weak, insecure, needy, helpless, lazy, etc.. Every negative word you could imagine.

Because I have bipolar, and my dad has untreated bipolar (diagnosed but denies it) that I'm ""exactly like him"" in every way. Yes, apparently I'm abusive and unpredictable. 

That ""did you take your meds today"" comment is thrown around a lot, as well as ""seems like your meds are finally working"" whenever there hasn't been a fight.

Again, I can honestly say these fights are not my doing and have nothing to do with my disorder.

Sister B doesn't like me or that I'm living here (""Something about her (me) just bothers me!"")

Brother A hates me (""Why can't she find a job and move out again. Things were better when I only had to see her fat face around Christmas."")

Sister A thinks she's better than me (""It's because she thinks she knows what she's doing. Like because she graduated college she knows anything about the subject. She doesn't know shit and may as well be in high school."")

Mother thinks I'm unstable and need to be ignored (""She's just like your father. Ignore her and we won't have any problems. She just lashes out when she gets mad."")

My ideas and opinions are brushed aside. Any time I make plans to do something with them, they keep telling me ""we'll go soon"" until it's too late to go, but if they want to do something, I'm left behind if I'm not ready at the exact moment they are. Like, *exact* moment. They don't involve me in anything other than going to the grocery store so I can carry the cases of water/dog food/water softener salt/etc. (I may be fat, but I'm stronger than my brother who lifts weights for fun).

I am literally stuck her for 2 years. It will take 2 years for me to pay off my debts and fix my credit score, and I'll be leaving for school again at that time to pursue my Master's.

Two. Years.

I would like to find a therapist, but I can't afford a single dollar on a copay, and I lose my coverage for therapists and psychiatrists in January. I'll have to see if there's anyone in my area who offers a sliding scale, but last I looked, there was only a handful, and they weren't accepting new patients.

I'm also ""accepted"" for a freelance job I applied for, but I have to wait a couple of weeks for them to send me a test to make sure I'm capable of the job.

Also, I have been on and off anti-depressants that never seemed to do much of anything for me.  I have lived a life riddled with an obscene amount of impulsive, terrible decisions.  Many times it felt like I was not able to even control these decisions.  They would happen in my manic phases and I would almost be blinded by the mania... then after the fact I look back and say ""What the hell??? Why did I do that?!""  I won't go into my darker days and the choices I made during those times... but I can say that I have ruined relationships, hurt my family, cost myself and my family plenty of money, etc.  All the while... I never felt like anyone believed that many times I felt (after the fact) that I was almost powerless over the choices I was making at times.  It was scary and very disturbing.  

So, I met when a psychiatrist who specializes in bipolar just the other day and his words, after talking to me for about 30 minutes, were ""Jesus... So I'm guessing you've lived a life full of terrible decisions... and you have felt like you couldn't even stop many of those times.""  I almost started crying in his office. No one has ever recognized that.  I'm not saying they need to pity me.  It just felt amazing hearing someone say that.  He made that statement after I informed him that I had taken one form or another of amphetamine for almost 20 years now.  Apparently drugs such as Vyvanse, Adderal, etc. are TERRIBLE for bipolar and especially so if you have much more pronounced and severe manic stages like I do.  Anyways, I am just glad to (hopefully) be getting into the right kind of treatment and medications now. Better late than never, right?


So, I do have a question.  He said he usually does a 2 medication combo for bipolar patients.  He pretty much always prescribes Lamictal for increasing the time between manic/depressive episodes and then prescribes something else to actually help when those episodes do happen.  


The meds he listed for me to check out were: Depakote ER, Tegretol, Lithium, Zyprexa, Seroquel, Risperdal, Abilify, Geodon, and Saphris.


Have any of you had really good or bad experiences with any of these? He wants me to inform myself on these medications and decide which 3 I find the most attractive to me ""as the consumer"" and we meet again this Thursday to go over them.  I figure user feedback is a great way to get some information on some of these.  Any thing you all can give me is greatly appreciated! Thanks so much!

I got a kick up the butt two months ago from my psychiatrist to improve my lifestyle and use ratings to get more objectivity in how I am going.

I've been rating my mood, sleep, exercise, diet and social contact for the past six weeks. Much of it confirms my opinions. Exercise is good for you, who knew. But it also seems to say so far that sleep is less important for me than I thought (I thought it was the most important thing). It also kind of says that social contact is most important to my mood. The readings aren't independent as I'll rate my enjoyment of hanging out with people higher if I already have a good mood. 

I write it out on pen and paper then put it into excel. My meds recently decreased in level.

He also ignores the anger bouts, and is always willing to move right forward, because he knows how embarrassed and ashamed I get about it.


Recently, I've been having paranoia about him cheating, when in reality he quite literally would have no time to do so. We discussed it, and agreed that some extra medication would likely help the issues I'm having.  (At that point, it was only 400mg of lamictal daily.)

My doc started me on Lexapro (escitalopram), 20mg, and I took it for three months, at first noticing improvements in my anxiety, and some improvement in my depression. I asked the doc for a referral to a psychologist, and found out that CBT is not covered by my insurance to the extent that it would be affordable, so as much as I'd love to see a therapist, I just cannot at this time. 

About 1.5 mos. into the pharmaceutical treatment, I noticed what I believe to be rapid cycling. Extreme mood swings, with highs lasting about 2 days, and then return of deep depression. I trucked on with the medication, until I just could not stand it any longer, and scheduled a follow-up with my primary. 

When I went in, I hinted at the fact that I think I may be bipolar, though she did not seem to be concerned about it. She told me that the rapid cycling is very rare, and very extreme, and that I may just have had a bad reaction from the medication. Now, I studied psychology, and have a BS in the field; I know what rapid cycling looks like, and I know how SSRIs exacerbate the effects of bipolar. I am not uneducated in these matters, I just happen to have horrible insurance and I desperatetly want ot be able to conrol my D/O. 

She recommended a new medication for me, another *newer* SSRI, called Viibryd (vilazodone), primarily for my anxiety. I accepted the prescription tentatively, doing my research first. This medication, I might add, is so new that I had never heard of it, and that its mechanisms of action aren't well understood. It is an SSRI, but not a classic, 3rd gen. like Zoloft or Lexapro. 

Though I was skeptical, I gave the drug a shot, thinking that perhaps the doc. was right, and that I just had a poor reaction to Lexapro. I guess, at that point, I was just so desperate for *something* to help me out, that nearly anything seemed worth a shot. 

It appeared to work the same way as the Lexapro had for me: reduction in anxiety/depression, but then I experienced the most severe manic states I've ever experienced. About two weeks into my trial of the drug, I was staying up for days at a time, taking three to four hour naps during the afternoon, and cleaning house or painting/sketching all night long. I just was not tired. Not in the least. 

About two weeks ago, I got sick with a viral form of meningitis, and was hospitalized for a week, during which time I had difficulty keeping any food, and thus, any medication that was not delivered via IV, down. I did not take the Viibryd while hospitalized, and I have not taken it since. I know the dangers of discontinuing psychoactive drugs, trust me, but... I also know that, with each episode of mania that occurs, the worse the D/O becomes. The more damage is done.

If the meds are exacerbating the D/O, I shouldn't take them. Intellectually I know that, but part of me still wants the alleviation of at least the anxiety. I am searching far-and-wide for a psychologist who will accept my insurance, so I can go through some CBT, and perhaps be referred to a psychiatrist, who will help me fond a medication that allows me to better cope with the D/O. It is so frustrating living in a country whose health care is provided based on monetary value, and not altruism. 

Thanks for sticking it out with me this long, if you have. I guess my question to you all is: if you are on a mood stabilizer, does it help to a degree that the pros outweigh the cons? I'm sure I'll be up all night (and day) fiddling about online when I am not working because, wouldn't you know, I just cannot sleep.

I am posting under an alternate name that is sort of my throw-away at times.  The name explains it pretty well.  I think I might not be bipolar.  It isn't an irrational feeling because I am up or down.

I had a nagging feeling for some time because I seemed to see some difference between others' experience and mine.  The posts I see here, it had much more major effects.  I had some major ups and downs, but even through those, I could keep jobs, though I did tend to go through a lot.  I did pretty well in high school, finished a degree in engineering, did some grad school, and got a job before seeing a doctor.

I started feeling much better after starting medication (lamotrigine), but I think that I did for a lot of other reasons as well.  That job I got was pure hell and I refused to quit.  The job broke me down and I learned a lot of very hard lessons about life.  I realized that I had terrible friends that made it a sport to tear each other down, and I got rid of them.  I saw that I had absolutely no self-confidence or self-worth. Once I did, I saw that it let girls use me and just be terrible to me.  I realized that my mood is very sensitive to food and sleep, and I completely neglected my own well being in many ways.  I don't know how it happened or how to explain it, but somehow I'd taught myself to ignore sleep, hunger, and most physical signs that you need to do something for your body until I felt like it.  So I started paying attention to that.

Making all of those changes made an enormous difference in how I feel.

However, I could feel that the medicine makes me sort of... hazy.  I don't know how to explain it other than that I feel slow.  I just didn't have much in the way of emotions, either.  Doc put me on buproprion.

Memory is slightly better, but now I seem to have more emotions again.  At first I thought the medication didn't work sometimes.  I'd get mad, or sad, or too happy.  When I met my current girlfriend, I realized something.  Feeling those things is normal.  When I got laid off and had trouble getting a job, was blowing through money, had to put to sleep a cat who I loved all my life, had few friends left, had trouble with my girlfriend, and my grandmother went downhill fast and passed away all in a few months... I should have felt depressed.  When in the coming months my girlfriend and I made up and I started a new job, I felt invincible.  Those were correct responses.

But I grew up in a family that always wanted a very tempered attitude.  My dad is the very definition of level headed.  I somehow came away from it feeling as though I should always be on an even keel and completely emotionally flat and objective.  I don't think they ever meant for me to feel this way, but it felt wrong to lose your cool or be sad.  

I look back now.  I had so many factors that will throw you off all going on at once.  No wonder I couldn't tell up from down.  And many of the things that cause my depressions were likely completely rational responses.  You lose a girl who you thought was the love of your life in an emasculating way when you have no self esteem, you will collapse.

And the truth is that I think the medicine makes me forgetful.  I normally am, but I just feel like everything is fuzzy sometimes.  It's really hard to explain.

Lastly, about my doc.  I know your first response will be to talk to him.... but...  I don't say it... but I don't think he is that great.  I don't think I've talked to him for more than 15 minutes in a visit in the last year.  Probably less.  We MIGHT have taken a full half hour my first visit, and I walked out with a prescription.  Now maybe that is normal, but he doesn't seem to talk much except to make sure I am not flying off the walls or crying in a corner (so to speak).  Hell, even when I was, it isn't that hard to see through his questions and manipulate them if I wanted.  Don't get me wrong, I don't.  Never would.  And when I did try to start a more in depth dialogue, he said I should go see a counselor.  To sum it up, it seems to me that it is clearly just drug management.  From reading here, I am pretty sure that a doc should do much more than that.  For that reason, I doubt he would be willing to entertain any of this.

I have had this idea now a little while to give it thought; I don't want to just decide I am okay and go off medication suddenly.  That's now what this is about.  After months of real thought on this, I am truly wondering about it.  I don't know how well I communicated it, but here it is.  I don't know if I am bipolar.  Maybe I was some iron-willed, bullheaded, hot-head who just refused to sort himself out until shit got bad.  Whatever you want to call it.  Maybe I had some hard lessons to learn about myself and about life and a set of unrealistic standards for ""normal.""

http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/2g73ik/its_all_falling_apart_again_a_rant/

TL;DR version is that I have an extremely erratic and unpredictable type of bipolar that makes medication difficult, and so far impossible, to get right.  Lately I've been in the worst depression cycle I've ever experienced.  It's impacting work, primarily my attendance, and it's become a matter of time until I'm dismissed for absences.

I had another sit down with my boss today.  No official discipline this time; I'd called to ask to come in an hour later, he'd declined, so I'd gone in a mess but missed no time.

""It's been a few weeks and we haven't really seen any improvement,"" he said.

No shit?  I wasn't able to eliminate the ill effects of a lifelong disorder, currently the worst it's ever been, in the course of single month?  Color me shocked!  I tried to explain it one more time.  I tried to use an example he might understand.  I wasn't gentle about it.

""You know that girl you're in love with?"" I asked.  ""You know, the one who broke up with you three years ago, but still convinced you to help her move to the other side of the country?  The one you still call and text and e-mail?  The one that, just last year, convinced you to fly out there, buy her dinners and spa retreats and jewelry, only to go back to fucking her new guy the second you boarded the plane home?  The one you say you'd still marry today, even though you know it'd be the worst mistake you've ever made?

""Tell you what.  Why don't you go home, take a day or two, and sort that out.  Just stop feeling that way about her.  Just don't ever think about her again.  Because that's basically what you're saying to me and it doesn’t work that way.  You can't just fix it.""

""I know that,"" he told me.  Probably the least true thing he's ever said and I wasn't satisfied.

""No,"" I said, ""you don't.  You still think that this is something that can be resolved by attitude or willpower.  And you'll always think that.""

I went on to explain how things would go from here, as I did in my original rant.  The bad days keep coming.  No matter what I do, I'm going to miss a day now and then.  I'll get written up, I'll get a final warning, and I'll be fired.

Given the business and HR's general excessive cautiousness, that could take some time.  Do I want to wait for that?  The job is putting so much stress on me at this point I'm not sure I can take much more.  The daily panic attacks and extreme depths I'm feeling are intolerable.  A week or so ago I cycled up into a pretty mild mixed state, then fell right back down.  Hard.  Suicide has *never* been an option for me.  I'd *never* considered it, but for a few hours a few days ago, it came close to being on the table.  It was terrifying.  I can't remember ever feeling this low.

If I'm fired, I have a chance at unemployment benefits after several weeks.  But will I be able to keep up with the claims every week in this sorry state?  Is it worth carrying the fault for my firing?

If I quit, I can make up any bullshit excuse I want in future interviews.  Maybe I had an extremely ill relative.  Maybe there was a death in the family and I was the only person who could see to the affairs.  I give up unemployment benefits, but I gain the ability to lie.

Right now I'm leaning strongly toward quitting in the coming days.  It could be financial suicide if I can't find something new, but that's a whole lot better than a real one.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

The first few weeks it was rough. I lost my appetite, wasn't sleeping well, having super intense and crazy dreams, and it TOTALLY nerfed my sex drive. Boyfriend &amp; I went from having sex 4-5 days a week to maybe two. Which is a HUGE decrease. (We've been together 8 months and from the start we've had a very active and satisfying sex life.)

I keep a mood-tracker on my phone at the suggestion of my therapist. It rates on a scale of 1-10. The last few weeks I've been sitting around the middle- around 5-7. Well, the last few days it's rocketed up to being 8/9/10 almost every day. And my sex drive has kicked back in (last four days in a row and a couple of other days last week to boot). I'm in an excellent mood, I have tons of energy, I want to have sex again, and I'm just all around up. And he even commented that I seem to be feeling better.

However, it makes me wary that I might be gearing up for a hypomanic stage. I see my pdoc next week to discuss how the new medicine is working out in my regime.

I just would like to know if perhaps this recent upswing might have something to do with my new medication finally kicking in and the side effects wearing off? I know that zoloft is known to create insomnia and decreased sex drive- which I definitely have experienced. But the last week or so I've finally been sleeping better and feeling good all around. (Was prescribed the zoloft to help combat my anxiety issues.)

Has anyone else had a situation similar to this? I'm definitely going to mention it to my pdoc next week. But in the mean time I want to be vigilant in case it is the start of a period of hypomania.","['nsubj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

I'm pretty stressed out about this. The two obvious problems are that I'll have to pay more than double what I've been paying for my meds and I'll have to get a new psychiatrist. For those of you who don't know, kaiser is pretty much only good for doctors at their handful of locations(only one near me has a small psychiatric dept), you just get what they have there, and then we get to the third problem which is how their approach to treatment was explained to me: almost everything is group therapy (only ones applicable to me are ones for mono-polar depression and one that's basically ""intro to bipolar"") and I'd only be able to see a therapist or psychiatrist 6 times a year. So what happens if I become unstable again and need the have my meds adjusted and have the changes monitored sooner than two months from then? Group therapy wouldn't be able to provide me with medical support if something bad happens. I'm scared that they're going to treat my disorder like it's some other illness that magically goes away with therapy -- it doesn't! I feel like the only choice I'd have would be to hospitalize myself if I needed help, rather than having a pdoc I can call and actually depend on to make sure my meds are always working the way they should... I'm especially worried about this because I'm still only ""close to stable"" after a breakdown in February.

So any of you out there with Kaiser: What has your experience been? Have you been forced to almost solely depend on group therapy? Are you able to get help when you need it?

I'm going to have to try to find a pdoc there either way, but from what I've been told (by a Kaiser social worker who didn't seem to know shit about bipolar), I doubt it will be a good fit for me... so I may wind up having to pay for supplemental insurance once money isn't so tight (SO is unemployed at the moment :-\ )

And on that note, for people without Kaiser: What insurance has worked well for you? At the moment I'm looking at Cigna, which is what I have through my parents... but of course I'd have to get a cheaper plan than what they have.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I don't know what I'm looking for here: sympathy, advice or just a place to rant. I'll take any, I suppose. My story goes like this: I met and fell in love with a man with severe mood swings. He would range from fine one minute-- to waking me up to go on a car trip at 2 o'clock in the morning to a place 500 miles away-- to utterly depressed and pissed at life-- to throwing tantrums to the point of verbal/emotional abuse. He couldn't keep a job, had a different plan for what he wanted to do with his life practically every day and went from loving me intensely to saying that I was a horrible human being and claiming he hated me. We had a lot of fun together. He made me laugh harder than anyone had ever done before... and he also made me cry a lot. 

I didn't understand what the hell was going on or why his moods and thoughts about everything changed so drastically. Some days we would be the best couple ever in his eyes and the next he thought we should break up and I was a horrible girlfriend because I did this and this and this, when the day before I was walking on water. As a trained social worker, I started looking more into it. His mother had very severe bipolar where she was hospitalized for being catatonic at times. I met her many years after this phase of life and mostly she sat and got numb and watched television by the point she came into my life, so I don't know about her manic swings at all. I do know however that my fiance's (ex-fiance.. whatever) father would hold this against her and use it to control her (he sold her car out from under her when she was in the hospital once). So growing up, seeing his mother like this and how his father used it to control her just screwed up his vision of mental health. He now believes that if you tell someone they're sick that means you're calling them crazy and they should be locked up and using it to control them.

Things in the relationship went from bad to worse and it ended with me breaking off the engagement and moving down south. He was just pushing me out of his life and pushing and pushing and pushing and eventually I just left. We continued to talk a bit and eventually he realized that he loved me and he had “made a mistake” and he wanted to get back together. At this time also I had a cancer scare (turned out to be benign) and he traveled to visit me in the hospital and asked me to marry him again. I said yes but I wanted him to get help for his bipolar. He has absolutely no trouble saying that sometimes he has manic moods and sometimes he's depressed. And he finally agreed to go get help. I was so happy and relived.

I wanted him to take a screening test on the Internet first. I had taken several with the information I knew of him and they all came back with high marks for bipolar possibilities and suggested talking to a doctor. One day when I was talking on the phone and he was annoyed because he had another fit at work and ended up breaking a broom while he was screaming at work. I sent him the bipolar screening test that night and he took it and it came back for him with the same 'bipolar possible, seek a doctor' results as before.

I told him that maybe he should do that and said I didn't know how I could be with him if he didn't get help. I really thought he had come out of his shell of denial long enough to listen. He didn't. Instead, he started screaming at me that I was the problem with his life (even though my life has gotten better while he's been gone, meanwhile he's still having fits at work) and once I was gone his stress would be gone and that's all he needed-- he needed life to stop stressing him out and then he could go back to being okay again (he hasn't been okay for years now, so good luck with that I suppose). It was all everyone else's fault, because that's always his excuse. He can't handle life because everyone else is out to get him. He ended up telling me that we needed to break up because I didn't love him unconditionally and if I couldn't accept his anger issues (which he's been trying to apologize for and “change”) than I obviously don't love him enough. He said he was going to go live with his sister who cares about him enough to accept him the was he is (she just won't tell him no to his face). And all about how I'm a horrible human being who's trying to stick the break up of the relationship on him and how I should just shut the fuck up. Then he laid into me for having depression and how crazy I must be then. Because everyone in his eyes who is sick with any kind of mental illness is just crazy and a horrible person and a monster. And then he asked how I could love him and say this to him and how I could think that he was “crazy”. I only told him because SOMEONE needs to and I love him enough to try to get him help because he tells me he pretty much hates his life all the time. A lot of my friends have mental health issues, myself included, and knowing that he's so bigoted against them really just shook me up a lot. He said I should just move the fuck on because I'm just trying to change him. I told him if that's the way he felt then he's welcome to leave but he's breaking his word to me when he told me in the hospital that he would go to a doctor. 

My roommate is married to a nice man who was hospitalized once and has depression. She went through a lot of the same stuff before and has gone through this whole process. She always says that the best thing that ever happened for them was that her husband was hospitalized and they found the right medication for him to be on so their life could settle down and they could be happy together. I told her some of what's been going on. My fiance/ex-fiance trusts her and I told him he could still keep in touch with her which is what she wanted. She really is hoping to talk to him at some point about all this but he has been ignoring us all (not calling, not answering his phone) for the past few days. She thankfully keeps reassuring me that I've done nothing wrong by trying to have an intervention with him.

I'm at my wits end. I know I can't go back to a situation like that without real change. I also know that I still love and care about him. I also feel like I'm right back in my family of origin because my father, mother and sister all died of substance abuse and never listened to my interventions either. It's my own stupid abandonment issues keeping me in this spot, I know. 

I think my next step might be contacting his sister and giving her all the information that I have collected. He'll see it as a betrayal but it might save his life. And if he's not talking to me anyway then there's really not much more that can be done. Then I'll just have to walk away.

So yeah, if you're out there and you got help for yourself and you listen to the people around you that care about you, then you're doing an amazing job because some people don't end with those happy endings. I'm kind of amazed at people who are able to battle such a diagnosis and face it with such bravery. I applaud you all.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

The mental health care there was fantastic- I was referred to a psychiatrist who over a period of time diagnosed me with bipolar 2, general and social anxiety disorders and PTSD. I was given counselling and access to a support group that really made me feel supported. 

I decided to move back to the UK this year to be with my so and near to my family. This side of things is great, however, I'm really starting to struggle with a lack of professional support. When I went to the Dr upon my return I was told that a diagnosis in another country is meaningless (despite being told I have bipolar by two independent specialists) and that essentially I am wrong. I showed them my psych report and it was dismissed. Conversely he still gave me a prescription for my meds.

I'm feeling like my meds need adjusting as my moods are really unstable at the moment. Alternatively I need a support group and counseling reinstated. The problem is that I don't have the confidence to go back and convince the Dr that I'm right. I know it is stupid but I'm struggling to even consider ringing the Dr for an appointment without stressing. Does anyone have any advice?

Also if anyone knows of where to find counseling or support groups in Cambridgeshire I would be appreciative.

Hope this makes some sense and sorry for the essay!",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Recently I wrote a letter about all the things I haven't told her, such as hearing/seeing things, thinking the universe isn't real, violence, etc. I'm so conflicted about giving it to her.

A few months ago I was prescribes Valdoxan (algomelatine) by my GP. My moods have been really good since then, although sometimes I hear things, see things, think something is manipulating my life, or just have this HUGE energy that I cannot use up, walking circles in my room for hours. My thoughts just wont shut up sometimes.

I've had a loooong stream of very good moods. My moods used to flip everyday and it was awful. These days I can get so much more out of life and I've been doing some amazing things lately.

I still get depressed, and the depression is a lot more dangerous than it usually is, I'm even self harming, which is something that I just do not do. I get suicidal most times I'm depressed and I've been very tempted to take all my medication at times. But the depression is always short lived, and the highs are long and good.

My gp doesn't want me to come off the valdoxan because it might be dangerous because he saw how low it got and he said it might exasperate things.

Anyway, I'm not here to talk symptoms, that's just letting you know where I am at.

I know after typing what I have typed, that I know there is a reason to keep seeing the doctor, but when I wake up tomorrow, and start my day, that's not what I'm going to be thinking. when I'm out running, I'm going to think about how nothing should jeopardize this, how good everything feels and how this is just what happiness is like.

More often these days, I think I'm fine, and that the medication is just working; I'm happy. I think that all the things that happen to me are just imaginings because of this possible 'bipolar' diagnosis.

Sometimes though I feel like I see things clearly, and I know that not everyone experiences what I experience, and that maybe I should try to figure out what is going on.

I honestly don't even know what is real in my life anymore. If I get diagnosed, I still won't believe in it. 

I just can't be bipolar, its impossible.


Well, I guess this is a rant, but if you have and advice or support, that would be really great, as I'm so confused and I don't know what or how to think anymore. I hate this. My psych appointment is in 5 weeks.

EDIT:
I've written everything down. I recorded my moods for a long time, but when I showed the pdoc (not my usual pdoc), he didn't seem too interested in it so i gave up.

Honestly what I have said here is the tip of the iceberg. 

My usual pdoc was away on maternity leave and is now only coming back. She is a really great person and has been the only doctor who actually understands me. until now I have been seeing a different doctor each time. One doc, there was somethign very wrong with her, she accused me of making everything up, she stared me down, even though she knows I have anxiety, she agrued me on everything I had to say, even things that were personal experience. I have never felt so small and so much a nusance as I have then. It was so traumatic, and I thought I would never be taken seriously again so I tried to commit suicide. I failed. The doc in the hospital gave me an evaluation.  I tried to tell her what was goign on but my head was so messy that I just ended up bad mouthing the other doc. I went home that day and got dumped. So I had to go back to hospital. At this point the doc in the hospital had spoken to said pdoc.

She said ""are you sure you just weren't over reacting?? She's a very nice lady.""

After this incident I feel like I haven't been taken seriously since. I have mentioned voices and pacing in circles briefly and its skipped right over.

I've spoken to other peopel who have seen that doctor and they have all said that she is defensive, condescending and seems like she has an agenda. These people that I have talked to also switched doctors and are much happier now.

I feel like my chances at help are already blown.

I don't know what I'm going to do if my new doc has lost faith in me too. I'm scared the letter will look like I'm trying extra hard to 'prove' somethings.

Today, I'm a paranoid obsessive mess.  Mostly because of a girl.  These negative thoughts can get so loud, its extraordinary hard for me to concentrate on my work.  I'm taking calculus 2 and I've got an exam on Monday.  I just can't sit down and relax long enough to do the work.  I'm having severe suicidal thoughts once or twice a week which is a big improvement from everyday since I started taking my meds.  My doctor has me on the highest dosage of effixor and rameron.

I start my new job on Thursday.  Everybody keeps telling me I will be happier with a job, so I've been actively trying to pursue one despite the fact that I really don't want one.  Or maybe I do want a job, I just don't want a boring job and because I lack experience, I know that's exactly what I'm going to get.

I feel like this medication is helping a great deal, its just not helping enough.  Like I went from a 0-5 and I'm stuck there when I need to be at least a 7 or 8.  Also it's helping with some symptoms, but its doing serious damage on others.  It's helped a lot with depression but it has jump started my anxiety.  And sometimes I'm fine, and sometimes I'm not.  The slightest bit of uncertainty, drama, or conflict will shatter me to pieces.  So I'm fine as long as I don't work, talk to people, and exercise every day.  But life is not like that is it?

It wasn't until a police escort to his psychiatrist appointment was required that he was admitted to psychiatric care for a week and a half and extra meds were added to his routine.

My daughter was now skipping school. She is in advanced placement classes and during this time her grades began to drop. She stopped doing her homework and sleeping all day. She is 16.

Or taking time off for his insane amount of appointments (psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, etc.) I was also about to go from short term contract worker to a full time contract. My boss kept not-so-subtley hinting I was ruining my chances at getting the contract with all the work I was missing. But what could I do? He's my son. I finally signed the contract at the beginning of the month bit now I wonder what they must be thinking.

Also, while my son was on the ward, I was going straight to the hospital to see him, to work, back to the hospital, then home to sleep every day. It was exhausting. 

After he got out, I picked up extra shifts any time I could to make up for times I missed for his appointments. I also lost track of my finances. Big time. Nature of the disease, right? 

I became suicidal. And I had a plan, and this time there was no way pumping my stomach was going to fix it.

I've been quite recently diagnosed with bipolar type II and it scares me. I always knew there was something wrong with me, that those sudden breakdown didn't come of nowhere and it explains all the time I couldn't get out of bed. I should be glad to finally know the cause of all my problems, but knowing makes it more...real. I have to face the truth though. It's nothing new to me and it's as if I couldn't recognized myself in the mirror.  

Since 16 yrs old, I've always dated guys online. It's weird, I do not understand. I'm just incredibly awkward in real life and it's as if I had no social skills the moment I needed them the most. In the relationships I had I'm constantly doubting everything. Whenever I get into a new relationship with someone, friend or romantic, I hate them. I hate them dearly. I am not sure why but it makes me distant from anyone. I hate being this super friendly person and acting like the biggest bitch afterwards. Even if the ""one"" came along I would ruined everything and run away. My heart has been broken so many time and I can only blame myself for it. I am my own problem. So I stay alone. Yet, isn't it better to love and have a broken heart than never living again this feeling. I lack of faith in love, in myself. I hate this disease. The meds they gave me don't work.  

I remember the rare time I was truly happy. Whenever I'm happy, I start realizing that I am and suddenly, it makes me sad. I'm so lost right now and I don't know where to head to. I just go out of the psych ward and I have no idea how to handle all of this. I want to start my life but I'm just this unstable, terrifying mess that only causes trouble.

well i had my biggest manic episode ever about this time last year and had no idea how to cope. i got super paranoid and thought people were watching me and that the police were after me. i would get high and write down all of these things that i thought were profound insights in pieces of paper and then hide them thinking people were reading them. i thought i was figuring out a system or something. i wouldn't sleep or eat for days and when i was around other people i was clearly not okay, talking incredibly fast and saying really grandiose things.

this episode ended with me crashing hard and sitting in the corner of my room with all of my electronics unplugged to make sure no one was watching me through the lenses on my computer or phone. i had run around the apartment earlier turning off all the electronics in everyone's rooms to make sure no one was watching me and scared the shit out of my roommate when i told him he had to take the battery out of his phone because the cops might be after us. i turned my phone on periodically to listen to the police scanner to make sure they weren't after me. my shrink called me to ask why i was 40 minutes late for our session and i told her i couldn't leave the house because i was being watched.

it was also then that i realized how crazy i sounded and was terrified to leave the house because i knew i wasn't right in the head. I ended up confessing to my roommate that i was not okay and that i needed him to just sit up with me until i felt better or went to sleep. he stayed up with me all night as i sat there, terrified of how crazy i felt, trying to distract me with movies and such. i ended up passing out exhausted after being up for several days straight and slept on the couch for like two days. i remember that in the period right before i ended up falling asleep, i was so far gone that i was starting to have visual and auditory hallucinations. my roommates would wake me up to give me my medicine and feed me and such. (GGG roommates, dealing with all of my bullshit and taking care of me without judgement.)

when i woke up from my two day sleeping binge i felt much more sane, thank god, and i got it together long enough to go to my doctor and get my medicines adjusted. now i'm fine, but i was going through my old notebooks the other day and the scribbles were a little bit disturbing. it was like something you would see in a movie about someone who had tons of paper plastered all over their walls caught up in a conspiracy theory that doesn't exist. threw those away.
so yeah, i definitely questioned my own sanity. i can honestly say i didn't feel sane at all in that moment. but i was still there experiencing all of it. its like watching your own mind go out of your control.","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

I feel like I can channel my energy into something productive, creative, and innovative; but I don't know how to go about doing this.


I have frequent musical hallucinations. They have become more prevelant over time; I hear them every morning and they are playing in my head for several hours a day- they are usually songs I've already heard before; I attribute them to some sort of hearing impairment (as I used to play drums frequently and there have been a few times where I was almost certain that I have some sort of permanent hearing deficit). I sometimes hear ""voices"" for the lack of a better word, but I am 100% aware that they are not really there and that I am creating them, perhaps out of loneliness or to guide me.


I live with my mother and sister and I plan to go to college soon. I was actually feeling good about attending college soon, but I get in these MOODS where everything is fucked. My attention span is terrible- generally when I read something, I forget what I was reading when I jump to the next paragraph. I have extreme difficulty focusing on words and their meanings.


My first ""manic state"" was after I used MDPV/mephedrone ""bath salts"" for the first time. I became very addicted to this drug and I don't feel like I have ever been the same since I first used it, in spite of the occasional ""stable/normal"" states I have felt since then. I generally do not experience MANIC STATES. I sleep TEN TO TWELVE hours a day for the past month or so. I sleep excessively. Occasionally I will sleep only a couple hours for a few days, or not sleep at all, but this generally doesn't last long enough to be considered a MANIC STATE.


I want a fucking hug. A god damn slushie. A fucking beam of light into my brain to activate neurons to help me see outside of myself. My thinking is negatively introspective and outwardly inverted; at least I am aware of this! But I don't know what to do. I don't know who to talk to. No one fucking listens. My ""friends"" insist that there is NOTHING WRONG with me and I am apt to believe them at times. They all insist that I am causing problems for myself and that once I get busy and active and start doing things I will feel much more in control of my life and of my emotions; I agree that activity will make me feel better.


But I fucking hate everyone. I am an empty shell. I am full of bitterness and hate. I hate myself: everyone becomes brighter. I hate everyone else: I become brighter. I am always wearing a mask; I am always transparent. 


There is never a balance of yin and yang. I have tried meditation; I am trying to learn yoga but I get extremely frustrated because I have always been  terrible at learning new information and reciting it; I am trying to learn more about the world around me.


I CANNOT AFFORD MEDICATION OR PSYCHIATRIC VISITS!~~ :(
I don't trust doctors. I just want the medication. I just want the fucking medication but I can't afford the visits to their fucking terrible ""services."" I have never met a doctor who has helped me. They all give me SSRIs which have fucked me. I took Lithium once and should have stayed on it; after I stopped taking it I experienced a ""MANIC STATE"" for three weeks.


TL;DR: How are your meds? How's your life? Do you feel like this? Do I sound insane? Do you care? Has anything improved for you since you began treatment? I can't hold a fucking job or stay in school. Have your meds helped you with this? Are there any programs you could refer me to in order to help with my inability to pay for treatment? I want to get ""stable"" so I can feel comfortable enough to make something of myself. I want to feel comfortable in my skin and in my brain. That is all.

Here's what's happening.  I started to panic because suddenly it seemed like my hair was falling out and I'm afraid it is from my meds since I'm on several that can cause hair loss even though I've been on them for a long time and haven't really noticed any.  I don't know if it can start at any time and can't really find an answer to that.

 So I just saw my dr last week and she actually gave me an appt for a longer time than usual, 6 weeks instead of 4 so I won't be able to discuss anything with her about meds even though I probably wouldn't want to because I know she would flip out if I want to change anything!!  They seem to think I will go running down the street naked in traffic  or something!  That is a quote from someone at the clinic, I forget who.

So I thought I would start cutting back a bit on a couple of them and cut 2 of them in half and dropped one completely.    

Yesterday, I felt the most wonderful sense of clarity and I believe that perhaps the meds I've been on have been stifling me and dulling my brain way too much.   I was actually driving to my therapist appt. and was nearly overcome by the beauty of the day and the sun on the trees and the formation of the clouds and I could once again see shapes in them like I used to before I started taking all these.   It has been hot and humid and thundery for days but yesterday was clear and sunny with puffy, white clouds and it was just sparkly! 

So anyway, I was describing this to him and how exciting it is to just feel so much that it is bursting out instead of just going along through the day.  I told him that I started to cut back because of my hair and how I now realize that I've been weighed down a lot by so much of the medication and that I think it might be a good thing that I had to do this and maybe a sign that things should change!

His opinion is that it is not at all a good thing and that it sounds like I should get right back on my meds all the way and that I'm actually hypomanic and he's concerned about a manic episode if I let it go, etc...

However, I do not feel out of control at all.  I feel wonderful and I haven't done anything stupid.  
The only things that have changed are that I'm appreciating the beauty in everything more because it all looks so much brighter to me and I think it may be because of loosening the hold the meds have over my mind.  I've been able to help people more because I've been out more and even taking people from my group at the clinic to places where they need to go and things like that.  It's awesome! 

 I am sleeping a bit less, though, I know that could be a warning sign so I need to keep an eye out. That's the only thing and probably because of not taking all of them.

I'm taking all kinds of vitamins and trying to eat food also at the same time so hitting this from all sides along with dropping some of these so hopefully my hair will stop falling out!!!  I think in part it might be from some malnutrition because of not eating properly. I'll have to wait and see.  

If you got through all this, thank you for reading it!  I just realized how long it is!!

Some medicine advice/experience please?

I've just been put on Quetiapine (instant release) by recommendation from my psych, but to be administered through my GP....

His instructions were to start me on 25mg TWICE per day, building up over a week to 100mg twice per day. So 50mg - 200mg over a week, but spread out.

This stuff puts me to sleep already, on the 25mg dose! I'm taking it at night and I'm asleep within an hour, then during the day I take it and I'm like a zombie.

From everything else I've read, most people seem to just take a full dose at night time, avoiding the day time sedation...

I'm on a day time dose now and I feel like I've done a bunch of Valium and like I just want to fall asleep. Speech is slurred and writing this is difficult. Auto-correct to the rescue!

I've not yet come across anyone saying they have a split dose like this... Has anyone ever been told to take theirs this way?

I was prepared for the sedation effects, but taking it during the day (if it continues to effect me like this) is going to make work etc v difficult!

I've only just started it and haven't gone up from 25mg doses to 50mg yet either.

Does your body build tolerance to the sedative effect? Because if 25mg makes me feel like this, then 100mg at lunch time is going to knock me out!!

People that take their dose at night time (as is the general concencus given what I've read), is that with IR or XR version?

 I have a bit of a weird question that, I'm forewarning you, will not be worded properly.

Whenever I see my psychiatrist, I always get the traditional ""any thoughts of suicide?"" And, technically, no. I do not really get suicidal thoughts. So she just writes me off.

But here's the thing. While I don't think about actually killing or harming myself, I VERY often have thoughts of just giving up. Not giving up in a deathly sort of way, but just crawling into bed and staying there, avoiding my education, any future careers (I'm currently unemployed), hygiene, etc. The only reason I get out of bed in the morning is the fear of being the ""failure child"" in my (large) family.

I guess my question is, does this warrant a second consideration from my doctor? I'll admit, she's not very good and obviously does not enjoy her job, but she's all I can afford. I've told her these things, but she dismisses it as if I had said ""yeah, my medicine is causing me dry mouth."" I feel like this is a little bigger than that.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

He was in the ICU for a few days and then in inpatient treatment and he just got out today. I also just moved 300 miles to somewhere I'm happy to live, and was offered a job I'm excited about (see, it's not all bad!).

While he was in inpatient, he called me at least once every day he was there. He seems to be doing much better, he says he's happy to be alive and his new meds seem to be working much better than his old ones, and he's going to be going to full-time outpatient therapy for awhile. It was kind of strange that he called me so often from inpatient, but I was happy to hear from him (of course I love him, and I wish we could be together right now, but the timing doesn't seem right for a serious relationship because we both have things to work on). I've also been speculating as to whether he broke up with me to isolate himself enough to attempt (which is a thing he has admitted to doing before -- if he's occasionally irritable or sassy with me when he's really depressed, he'll take a step back and realize it's a subconscious attempt to isolate himself). At the time he told me a huge part of him was telling him it's the worst decision he ever made, but he felt like he had to give himself a chance to work on himself alone, in case it's what he needs.

The conversations we had while he was in inpatient were pretty brief, but he kept bringing up that I need to go back to therapy (I have bipolar 2, I was in therapy when we were in school, but I haven't had health insurance since then so I haven't continued with it. I'm fully insured by my new job, so I'm planning to go back once I start work -- he doesn't know about my new job, I got the offer in the middle of all of this and I didn't want to give him the news since he should be working on himself instead of comparing his situation to mine, which has happened in the past). He was also bugging me about a few other things, which I later realized were the things we had talked about me needing to work on before we could be together, should we decide to be together in the future.

Although I'm so glad he's okay and he's feeling better, I was kind of pissed to hear him, from inpatient, bugging me about getting therapy, which I fully intend to do the second I have the means (and he knows that, regardless of whether he believes it). I feel like given the circumstances I am doing relatively well, and although this week especially I could have benefitted from being in therapy, it was weird to hear that from him. I know he's trying to look out for me, but it just seemed odd and made me a bit upset. It also seems a bit strange to me that he is contacting me since we weren't really talking in between us breaking up and his attempt (my decision, although I didn't let him know about it, and thank GOD I answered the phone when he needed me). 

I'm just looking for any insight or advice into this situation. I'm starting my job and going back to therapy next week, and things are really going well for me, other than this situation with him -- I ultimately do want to be with him, and I understand that we both need to take care of ourselves, but I feel like we could do that within the context of a casual relationship (i.e.: dating, not FWB), until we decide what to do from there. 

I have lots of feelings and I don't really know what to do with them (other than go back to therapy ASAP).

My psych. put me on depakote, and I'm currently working my way up slowly to the 1500mg does (500 x 3) that he wants to start me at.

I've gotten mixed replies from people I've confided in, some seem sympathetic, other just comments based on a lack of understanding. (example: ""Well if the meds work, maybe you wont need them long!"")
Some even made the comment ""Hey I probably have that too!""

I've had a lot of mixed feelings about it all. One one hand, I'm glad my illness has been narrowed down and that hopefully they can treat it properly (I've had some horrible reactions to ssris), On the other hand its hard to be diagnosed with something that you can't ever completely recover from.

I wasn't exactly the king of the school but I had a car, 4 year varsity letter athlete in our schools strongest sport, got the hottest girl at school, no fucking shit. 
I was still kinda depressed, but only had a few manic episodes that were pretty ""successful in terms of epic debauchery, squeezing out some ideas. I was known as ""crazy in a cool way"", I had a strong group of friends and stuff and a quasi support system in a family wrecked with mental illness and addiction.

My parents aren't exactly rich. I was seeing the school psychologist and let it slip one day that I was on pills and whiskey that morning. bad mistake, got kicked out of school a month before graduation, sent to rehab, got brainwashed that i was powerless over my addiction. in the ensuing 8 months i wrecked my car got kicked out of 3 relatives house and was homeless, and got a dui and 3 drunk in publics.

Than I went to a county mental health place for 6 montsh. The meds they gave me, latuda and buspar gave me paraskinasia, crippling anxiety, and developed weird physical tics i have yet to get rid of. I left and have been couch surfing since, reputation ruined, basically penniless, half sober, half fucked up, confused and lost. I'm 20.

The fucked up thing is I have everything but my mental health and reputation.
- good looks, i'm depressed and i can't deny them

- outgoing personality, yeah but kind of abrasive and non professional, good for making quick friends and rarely keep them

- smarts, yeah everyone thinks that they're a genius but I read like a fiend and consistently school my ""bachelors degree as a means of economic utility"" buddies from high school on everything from how 1973 was the beginning of the end of the american experiment because of conservative reactionaries, a loss of trust in government, and the oil crisis, to how the tumblr feminism they engage in after one women's studies course is outdated and ruins the movement to the Nietzschean Last Man as the center of our reaction to the death of God. Yeah try me motherfucker, when i have a sad sack rant I get to show off a bit.

Meds? no fuck that I've been taking them on 6 week + cycles since 15 and I have yet to see an improvement in my psychological symptoms besides less mania. are you fucking kidding me, stick me with self-hatred, suicidal thoughts, and anxiety, but i don't get to be hypomanic every  few months, die in a hole motherfucker

Therapy? that outdated freudian bullshit their pushing at the clinic? no it brought up every supressed memory of my child hood and made me explore them. i'm convinced memory suppression is a good thing. my friend who was raised by crack fiends says without memory suppression he could not function whatsoever. I got knives waved at me and shit as a kid, i experienced things no kid should be forced to remember, fuck you.

Friends and social engagement? two of my boys have held it down for me since day one, the rest can go eat a dick, their just scenery and are in it for a good time and themselves.

Career? are you fucking kidding me go get 3 degrees that are going to be increasingly meaningless as the gulf between the upper and lower class widens to an ocean and I have no contacts outside of the working poor and already ruined half my networking opportunities while learning nothing i couldn't learn through jstor and nexus accounts i have access to?

But that's life, it's useless if your not a perfect shiny wheel in a corporate/ institutional machine now that privacy is dead. i can't even go get my dick shot off in Afghanistan, for christ sake.


I'm hoping my liver gives out soon, i think alcoholic hepatitis is setting in, don't tell me i'm too young, i've consumed a mountain of perscriptions on top of the booze, my breath is bad, my digestion is fucked, my right sides giving pains, my skins too hot, my dick hurts when i pee, i'm having weird cognitive problems, if it's not alcoholic hepatitis its severe liver damage. why would i go to the hospital to rack up debt and poor credit on treatment i couldn't dream of affording? continue my cycle of poverty or die, those are literally my only options as MediCAL takes about 6 to 9 months to sign up and I've been trying for like a year.

some mental illness cases and life cases are hopeless without an aptitude towards hard work i never valued. 

America is in decline, the future is very bleak no matter what your slick talking heads and politicians and ""cool rich guys"" tell you. read up on economics, like a lot of that, and you'll understand that. China is going to combust pretty soon, automation of manufacturing + unsustainable growth, their wily though, they might pull it out if they can suffer the loss of a quarter of their population. we're still putting greenhouse gasses in the air at record rates and no one actually gives a flying fuck, we'd have to change our consumption habits and launch a covert attack on india and china to make them stop using coal, that's what we used anyway, they say, why can't we do the same thing? a few may survive or the biosphere may just give up. 

growth by numbers will continue, if you aren't just fucking driven or connected i would say go start a survivalist community in 45 years.

 I was finally diagnosed with BD about 5 years ago after I suffered through post-partum depression after the birth of my beautiful son.  However, this past year has been the roughest of all of them so far.  My mother who is only 59 had a massive stroke in Early March leaving her unable to care for herself.  The doctor I had been seeing had me on Lamictal and Wellbutrin XL for many years.  However, when this happened to her I had a mental break down.  Everything that could go wrong went wrong and now she is in a long term care facility and not even 60 yet.  On the day my mother had a follow up surgery to open up her carotid artery in her neck. I had an appointment with my psychiatrist of 5 years.  (Her mantra for 5 years was always EXERCISE.  I am obese and she was correct it does help when I can accomplish it).  Since my appointment and my mother’s high risk surgery fell on the same day I called the week before and requested a phone consultation instead.  This is where things started going worse.  My appointment was scheduled for 8:45 am and I was told by the receptionist to call at my appointment time.  So I start calling and nothing.  No answer, the system keeps telling me the office is closed.  Finally I get through a 9am and I am told that the phone systems do not operate until 9 am and my doctor is with another patient.  I then ask them to have her call me and I will wait.  When my psychiatrist finally calls we around 9:30 she tells me that I was late for my appointment and would need to reschedule and she would do me a favor and not charge me for the phone call (which she ended up trying to charge me for in the end).  I was devastated, my mother was on deaths door my panic attacks were getting worse and the one person I thought I could count on just blew me off and hung up on me when I tried to explain to her in a very manic state what had happened.  The next week I had another psychiatrist.  He seems very thorough and more involved.  However, I went to a visit completely manic and freaked out and he prescribed me 80mg of Ziprasadone/day on top of what I already take.  I have been extremely unstable on this medicine.  I swing more than I ever had before.  I made the decision that it was not working for my body chemistry and called my new doctor’s office.  The receptionist told me they would get back with me.  When they did, it did not go very well.  My doctor was out of the office and she told me to not change anything.  I made the decision that moment that for once I was certain of what I needed to do.  At that moment I had to break it down that I was not calling as a joke and I needed to get off the medicine.  She begins to hound me on what happened and why I needed to quit the Ziprasadone.  This struck me the wrong way and I reminded her she was not my doctor and she had no business knowing that information.  Finally, they stopped messing around and put me on with another doctor at the practice who asked me to cut my dosage back to 40 mg and wait for the prescribing physician to return to the office.  I just don’t want to take it anymore…  I have been completely unstable.  Suicidal thoughts have never been a problem but I was so hopeless last night that they popped up.  My desire to live for myself and my family has always been so strong and this new medicine tried to rob me of that.   

All I want in this life is normalcy, rational thoughts, and to be able to trust my own perceptions.  I’m not sure what I hope to gain from sharing this with you all but I felt a need to get it off my chest.  Due to my illness I have 0 real friends and I lack any reasonable real world social skills to make any.  I also feel like no doctor will acknowledge my panic attacks and try to help me deal with those with immediate relief medication, they would rather keep putting me on extreme chemicals.  Anything (advice, criticism and encouragement) from this community would be very much appreciated.

4) i only started doing this recently honestly. i never played the guitar seriously until i was 21, same with writing actually. am i still an early bloomer?  do i still need to ""keep at it"" keep practicing? all those years of playing video games must of kept me from being creative.

I'm 28 years old, currently I see a therapist who helps me a lot, but finances stops me from seeing her more than twice per month, which is far from enough, I need to see her twice a week.
My meds are working pretty good, I think. It's better than ever at least.
I don't hit the worst mania or depressions. Still however I am very unstable every now and then.

I am joining a group therapy for children of alcoholics, which I know will help me a lot.

I have a lot of government support things going on, but it is hard getting any actual help out of that since I am doing too well to be put on a psychiatric pension or something like that.

Anyway, I'm really starting to think that I am not Bipolar 2 and just tend to suffer from depression and mild anxiety during hard times and after hitting the town too hard and popping pills twice a week and smoking weed every other day for about a year. Ecstasy twice a weed = bad for the brain lol.

My psychologist had me take a fairly comprehensive test which I scored above average in for anxiety, depression and Bipolar 2. 

I marked myself on the top scale for things like:

Having moments of being extremely high
Periods of hypersexuality
Not sleeping much
Enjoying alcohol and (party) drugs
Agitated nature

You know, the usual Bipolar stuff - marked most of it highly with little knowledge about Bipolar.

I have been slowly realizing that I was totally wrong. I mistook the test. I don't get extremely high, just happy when my life is good. Its completely 150% situational and environmental.  I don't get hypersexual, I was just a single male having fun. I enjoy alcohol and was taking drugs because I liked it, just like the other 5,000 people in my area who are into that scene and because my group does that. I stopped purely with my willpower and because I want to change my lifestyle due to having a girlfriend.
I don't sleep much (6 hours per night) because I start work at friggin 4am and do 10 hour days. I have never stayed up more than 1 night at a time. And always feel fucked from it and catch up the next day.
I get agitated, but only at smartass people and when my family get into a dispute or people start picking at me and being irrational over silly things.

I agree I have anxiety and a little OCD and maybe a mild borderline personality disorder or something, but I am starting to swear I don't have Bipolar 2. I can't relate to you guys at all really. I sorta tricked myself into believing it all cause I wanted to not feel depressed due to having no money etc.

Yes I am medicated with 200mg Lamictal, no it isn't doing shit all for me. I'm not doing this because the medicine is making me feel better. People have even commented that I'm not much different and it sounds like a load of crap and that I was just going through a rough patch and the drugs got to me. I CONTROL MY MOODS. AS I SAID, ITS 150% SITUATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL. I still get irritated and depressed and all that normal stuff when I am low on money cause works slow or something, but something as simple as ""eh, it isn't so bad"" snaps me out of whatever shitty mood I'm in.

What do you guys think? I'm gonna go get a second and third opinion.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I don't know, but I almost lost a friend of mine a year ago, when lamictal went wrong and I called and stuff happened...so he thougth I was just being overdramatic and stuff. I tried to explain, and we still remain friends, but I have never mentioned my condition to him anymore. He doesn't know much about it and right now he is sorting out his own stuff.

Blah, anyways, I was diagnosed about a year ago. I didn't even get a reference, I just did my own research and went to the psychiatrist, who was also a therapist. I can tell whatever I want to this guy, without him trying to belittle what I say I feel or do. You know, it's freaking annoying when you say ""I feel like throwing up from anxiety whenever X thing happens""and they say ""oh, that could happen to anyone"" 

I can say I'm high high functioning. I always had a personal hell going on, but everything else was just fine. Maybe I spend a little too much money sometimes, fight other people, get in trouble, and steal stuff, but nothing that has put me in the police. Things that have affected my relationships, yes, but I'm still around. Right now, I'm doing grad school and last week were my midterms. Lots of stress, I think I did well. 

At the same time, I keep wondering, does any of this matter? I feel like if I could, I don't know kick someone on the face or drop school, it doesn't really matter. Then, the next moment I feel happy, I sing to songs, I cook. Then, deppressed, I eat too much, move little. I'm in a better condition than I was years ago. Years ago, I would sit down and write short stories everyday until midnight, or I would just lay down on the floor, eating bread the whole day, plus several *about ten* daily showers.

Sadness is a beautiful feeling. But, depression is not. Today I woke up, tired, with that typical ""soul ache"" in my chest, and did not do anything until now. I know I'm supposed to cope and medicine will help me with it, but it changes up down up down up down. Yesterday I was the happiest kid on the block. While driving I bought some songs out of itunes which then I proceeded to listen and sing. But today, it's like I drank poison.

And don't get me started on how horrible I can be. I'm currently avoiding certain people because I know if I spend time with them or send them texts or anything I will end up telling them how ignorant they are. Complete idiots, and the hate will flow out of me. Fast forward the next morning, I feel healed and ready to love the world again. WTH.



It gets to a point in which...if I'm not careful enough, I just get tired of living like this. If nothing matters, I guess I put myself in so many things so I have strings attached so I don't go away so easily.

I see many people with bipolar constantly complain about the depressive aspect of it and how their medication doesn't treat it. Guys, medication can only help you on the biological level of the brain, but I think most of you are depressed for other reasons. If no medication helps you, it means the problem isn't biological but psychological : you're depressed because of an element in your life that bothers you. It could be your self image, a divorce, unhappy career, loneliness...etc

(A recognizable precursor to this occurred in June-July 2010, under similar circumstances, but corrected itself without treatment or diagnosis when I left town as a result.) Through the end of March, I basically wandered between Washington, Oregon, and much of Northern California, taking greyhounds between cities and compulsively walking 7-8 miles a day, alternately sleeping in parking garages and 24hr. supermarkets and booking rooms in expensive hotels until depleting my checking account and maxing out my credit card.

Parts of the episode were quite brutal. Early on, I spent a week and a half in Seattle during the blizzard that buried the city in snow, and late at night a couple hours before it struck I made it to the Union Gospel Mission Center literally moments before the doorman locked up and turned out the lights. I had nothing warm to wear except a sweater and jeans, and if he hadn't broken protocol by letting me in, I would have died before morning. There was only one bed left in the shelter. The next evening, there were none, but I was fortunate to receive a heavy snow jacket from one of the staff before leaving to find somewhere else to sleep. 

After a few more days of wandering I reluctantly called a former employer and convinced him to buy me a train ticket to Portland (this was after I emptied my bank account for the first time but before I obtained my credit card, which I had cut up the previous summer after finally paying it off), where I had lived for a while and knew people, and figured my chances for getting my shit together were high. I turned to a previous housemate for help, but she freaked out a little -- I showed up without warning, dirty and unshaven and quietly delirious; she fed me, but after conferring with the other tenants, sent me on my way, and I found out much later that she assumed I'd been using hard drugs. (I hadn't been, and had no history with anything serious, although now I take it for granted that my recent marijuana use likely contributed to my psychosis). With others, the story was similar: generous handouts but no place to stay, and although one person referred me to a directory of homeless shelters downtown, they were perennially full (this was Portland, after all). After a few days, I fainted one early morning and concussed myself on a brick sidewalk, and failing to walk it off I had a stranger call me an ambulance. I spent the next week and a half in the hospital with minor injuries (a fractured skull and some bleeding on the brain), recovered without surgery and forwarded the bill to my parents.

Wait a minute, my parents? Why didn't I call them before, ask them for help? They lived on the other side of the continent, but of course they would (and eventually, did) come running to my side in the event of any possible harm to my person. This, however, was one of many relationships in which my delusions interfered. For a while, I'd felt that they were bent on taking away my freedom in order to distract themselves from what I perceived to be a series of poor choices they'd made in directing their own lives. After Seattle but before Portland hospital, I sent them and my brothers a couple of nasty, rambling emails about their alleged sins. Several weeks later, I became convinced that my dad had molested me as a young child, and completely severed contact with my immediate family while enlisting the help of several relatives on both his and my mother's side to help ""bring him to justice."" Before all that, though, after leaving the hospital, I went to my bank, obtained a new credit card and booked an overnight bus ticket to Sacramento. My mother and father were waiting for me there at the station.

We went for lunch to an Italian restaurant and had a brief heart-to-heart, which to me was at best a cursory process. During the long weekend before I left Portland, my parents had flown in to look for me, mostly sticking to downtown and Hawthorne Blvd. around Mt. Tabor; I had holed up in a hostel farther north. But on the night that I left, they checked the greyhound station, and the ticket agent disclosed that I'd taken the Sacramento bus. When I found them there upon arriving, they were both visibly worried and relieved. To their eyes, I was bone skinny, having lost about 25lbs. in the past three or four weeks, dropping from a lean 165 at 5'10"" to an atrophied 140. On the other hand, I'd recently showered and shaved, had bought clean warm clothes and a skull cap to cover the head wound. I wasn't a picture of good health, but I wasn't a mess either. 

Furthermore, I somehow managed to mask the worst of my psychotic symptoms, which were still emerging, and persuaded them to let me have it my way and stay on the west coast for a few more weeks to ""ground,"" after which, I assured them, I would finally return to the east coast and stay with them for a while. My dad left that night; the next day, I went with my mom to my bank to arrange for the transfer of funds into my checking account for a couple weeks of living expenses, and sold her on the story that I would immediately be going to Sedona, Arizona to hike, do yoga, eat whole foods and that kind of thing. I went to L.A. instead. I was going to be a movie star.

It went downhill from there.

Long story short, I kept wandering. Feast first, famine later. Subsisting on stolen foodstuffs and the occasional complimentary breakfast at various hotels where I posed as a paying guest, taking generosity and cruelty in roughly equal measure. Waking up every day in a strange place. 

Six or seven weeks into this phase I was arrested for breaking into and entering an empty duplex while looking for a place to sleep. Two very instructive weeks in jail, a felicitous court hearing (felony charges dropped, stuck with a misdemeanor count of malicious mischief, a three-year suspended sentence and probation) and another two weeks in a local psychiatric ward. Somewhat against my original wishes, and without meaningfully informed consent, I began taking Latuda, a newer atypical antipsychotic, acquiescing to the treatment only after a voice in my head (belonging to, I shit you not, the immortal extraterrestrial vampire Virgin Mary, and by the way, also the occult basis behind V in Alan Moore's *V for Vendetta*) told me that the pills were ""power medicine"" and would level up my defenses against Aleister Crowley's malign army of sorcerers, who counted my ex-girlfriend among their number. (At the time, I considered myself a shaman.) For me, Latuda was terrifying. The medicine induced spells of creeping, suffocating anxiety and depression for several hours after dosing, a feeling of being drowned in a dim, molasses-thick malaise. But gradually, I stabilized. Following a Thermopylae-scaled final stand against my mom and dad, during which I legally barred them from entering the hospital,  I suddenly realized how completely *wrong* my thinking was. That, and another event that I'll come to later, punctured the abscess distorting my perception, and over the coming weeks and months, having returned home with my parents, I climbed out of the uncanny valley and returned to the land of the living.

Been spending as much time trying to understand all the symptoms: Mania, Hypomania, the depression and anxiety caused by both. The dozens of meds they describe, what works, what doesn't work. While some of the symptoms only minorly relate to me, others are way off base. And each and every inescapable conclusion I have is that I really don't understand this disorder.

I need everyone's thoughts here, why you think (or know) this disorder fits you, and how you justify the meds. I'm not being cynical, honestly, it's just that it's so hard for me to accept something which in my heart knows doesn't exist, yet because of my lot in life, I can't afford to get a second opinion, and medication is not only unattainable ($$$), I have a deep fear of them down to a fundamental level. 

The flip side of that coin is I will end up dead or homeless if I don't do anything. Don't look at that as a cry for help or sympathy though, that is not my goal nor do I want it, it is just an uncomfortable fact that I'm dealing with. I'm trying to establish clarity and perspective, and maybe with at least a dozen people's posts describing as accurately as possible their symptoms and how they make you feel, maybe I can find some correlation. Because I well understand everyone is affected differently, and because of the complexities of this disorder I just for some reason can't wrap my head around this issue and it's pissing me off.

I told him what he could do for me- it wasn’t overtly sexual but suggestive.

1- I've been mild/moderately depressed (not suicidal. intense self-loathing, guilt, crying) for a couple months with no improvement, I've just been keeping it as a part of my life and I don't like that. 
2- I recently feel like I've been cognitively slowed down. Forgetting too much shit, trouble getting other people to understand what I'm saying, stupid mistakes. I know that kind of fog is a common complaint, but for me I honestly thought it was probably just depression talking, I call myself stupid all the time. Now I'm not sure which it is at all. 

So maybe there does need to be an adjustment. I told my psychiatrist and she was talking about how, although the meds are clearly doing something (I'm not suicidal and not manic) we can fine-tune them so I start feeling better and more like myself. So the plan is/was to add a med until I get used to it and can start coming down off the Lithium, and the best bets she said would be Seroquel, Lamictal, or Latuda. I have nasty reactions to the first two, discovered when I was inpatient, so Latuda it is. You know how they're required to tell you ALL possible side effects first, well...yeah...

Scared the shit out of me. An ""irreversible"" facial muscle control problem (TD), seriously? I know the chances of are very small but it still threw me because what if what if what if. Also ever since I got a tattoo while manic the mere idea of permanence kind of sets me over the edge... anyway she said while it's very unlikely to happen I had to evaluate these things and weigh risk against benefit and all that and I can't. I don't know what to do even after crying in my car for an hour. Stay with what's semi-working and just deal with the chronic depression and being slower? Accept the risks of a different med, including if it just doesn't work at all and I go right back to where I started in chaos? Feels verrrrry stuck between a rock and a hard place kind of thing and also I don't trust my own judgment so I'm pretty lost.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I feel really kind of high and somethings very wrong but I don't know what it is and I did one of those test things that you're supposed to print off to show your doctor and it said there was about an 80% chance I had bipolar so I thought I should post it here. (are those things even accurate? The website I did it on looked really official and doctor~y)

 So I've been taking SSRI's for  about a month. 
First they gave me citalopram (Celexa in U.S) which was just horrific, I was a shaky nervous wreck, I couldn't sleep or eat and all the bad thoughts were so overwhelming that I probably would've tried killing myself if I was able to get out of bed. I ended up back at my parents house after two weeks of that, carried on taking it doctors orders in case it got better. I wasn't supposed to go back to my parents over summer. I was supposed to have a job and save up for my second  year of uni. Shit happens I guess

So that didn't work (I didn't tell the doctor how bad it was because I didn't want to wind up in hospital because the fucking meds didn't work, I swear I wasn't even that bad my therapist was just worried about me because I was hella stressed and worried and everything was going a little bit grey again but it was okay and anyway she told me to ask the GP for antidepressants.

I've been taking Sertraline (Zoloft in U.S.) for about a week. The first few days I felt kind of like on the citalopram but instead of being really low, I would lose my temper at the slightest little thing and I just felt like there was a massive storm building up in my stomach and I was getting desperate because I didn't know how to make it go away.

It got better and I started feeling really good. This morning I accidentally took 100mg instead of 50 and I feel really happy with life and I had so much energy that all I could do was lie down (does that even make sense) and I just laid in the grass and felt really at peace with everything and I just felt super connected and in touch with nature and I could feel energy flowing through me lol. Life is pretty good.

I think my mum is worried about me. She says I've been really easily distracted, and my crazy ideas are getting out of hand. I wanted to go on a walk today because it was raining and walks in the rain are the best and there's a hill about 10 miles away from where I live and I thought it would be really fun to walk up there and back. She locked me in after that...) I cleaned the whole house (she was happy about that but I'm not a cleaning person and IT WAS IMMACULATE. I wanted to throw loads of crap away but she wouldn't let me, I just don't understand why we have so much shit from when we were children in my house like what just get rid of it, there's no use even keeping it for grandchildren because they'll probably have computers implanted in their brains by then and they definitely won't want my old barbie doll that I gave haircuts and drew makeup and tattoos on it. UGH)

My insomnia is worse than ever. I didn't really sleep last night and I just had a little nap today and now it's 3am and I don't feel tired in the slightest and I'm getting quite bored but I need to be quiet because my family are sleeping and I need to behave because I don't want them thinking I'm batshit. I just feel really hyper and I have so much energy and I want to go and do something really reckless. I don't have any appetite and can't eat until about 6pm and I wouldn't eat if my mum didn't make me but I'm just not hungry adn it's just boring to sit down and eat when there are better things I could be doing.

I feel great though, I feel a lot better than I have in a long time. I  feel really really happy. Like I've taken a shit ton of MD and I'm just endlessly coming up. It's quite fun. I like where I am now, because I've done so much writing in the last few days and I'm halfway through the jumper I started knitting on the weekend and I even tried painting but I'm so out of practice it was rubbish. So it's all really fun.

But then I'm kinda worried because what if I keep getting higher and higher and higher. I mean at least with MD I still have some semblance of rationality and still have some form of control. Now I feel really out of control (but it feels really good atm) and I'm just worried what I might do. At least I don't have any money to go on any adventures. That might not end well.

I'm rambling a bit now aren't I? I don't actually know what I was trying to say but that turned out to be an essay and a half, wow. Also, where has the punctuation gone? I swear I know how to do grammar and writing properly; I don't always sound like a five year old who accidentally got hold of their big brother's red bull. 

I have a doctor appt tomorrow to see how I'm getting on. I want to ask if I can carry on taking 100mg for the rest of the time because it feels really really great. But maybe that's not the best idea. I'm also really worried that I'll end up in hospital. I'm acting weird but I'm not fucking crazy I'm just really happy and I'm not doing any stupid shit I just want to be peaceful and live in some little cottage somewhere and just become a flower child and escape and hide away from modern civilisation because it's just really draining and awful and wow okay that's complete nonsense but yeah. I guess I'm kinda asking what do I do?

Reading back over my posts, I see there have been a lot of 'wishful thinking' about that. But, I think so.

The big issue now is I have a looming deadline, and I don't know what's going to happen. Basically, after 15 years safely at home, I need to get a job. No, I *have* to get a job, by October, or we will probably lose our house. I just need a part time job, minimum wage would work. Sounds so simple, doesn't it?

I haven't really been out of the house much for years. If I can, I will take either a kid or my husband if I have to go the store, for chrissake. I can and do go alone, but I it takes some pretty intense mental ""baby steps to the door, baby steps to the caaar"") What About Bob behavior for sure. I do try to hide it, because it's embarrassing as hell. I panic whenever my phone rings, and I have to answer it. I only feel safe in my home. It's the only time I feel remotely normal. 

I guess it was easy to not notice this when I was busy being out of control or engulfed in depression (or drinking), but now it's feeling like a tooth being drilled on without anesthetic. I can't hide. I can't get out of this, but I don't really know how one gets a job when one can't even face the idea of going into somewhere and asking for an application, and that's on top of not working for a decade and a half (and that was in dentistry, a field that's not only left me behind, but one that's really intense and stressful.) 

This is really starting to mess with my mind. I'm working with my psych, and we are talking about benzos to help me get through the door, but I just don't know if they will be enough. Yet letting my family down is not an option. I think if it gets to the wire, I'll have to take a fast food job, and I know that will be my unraveling if that happens.

Not really asking for help here, I just wanted to rant a little in a safe place where no one irl can hear it.  I know this might belong in r/anxiety, but it's not a familiar sub, so I don't feel safe posting there. See that? I can't even handle going to a virtual place that I'm unfamiliar with. Gah.

It was exacerbated symptoms due to a bad concussion. The event brought to light a lot of things I was hiding. It was a needed event in my life.

But that was years ago, and treatment has been painful and long. I think I am stable, or at least stable enough to function. I have been through a few doctors had my meds played with enough that I have a good cocktail. My biggest fear is that I will fall back down the hole to where I came from.

So, what kind of questions are useful to ask? I'm going tomorrow and compiling my thoughts tonight. I want to make sure I get to the point. This is our first meeting. I have a lot to cover and I know that a lot of this meeting will be rather austere; what medications do I take? Do I have any allergies? Etc. I know it's got to go through this, but a big added feature is that I'm not going during a time of tranquility, but turmoil. I have important questions, and shaky emotions. I need to be able to talk about this. So, in a way, I have a secondary question. How do I get this to go in the direction I need it to? Can I say, I know we have preliminary information to go through, but let's jump right in? And, honestly, that's not exactly easy for me, I need to be comfortable with this person and that doesn't happen in 15 mins.

To reiterate, though, I also want to be organized and if we must go through the preliminary stuff, then I too want to ask the right questions of them. I mean, what's common? Should I ask about their credentials? What school they attended? Are they capable of dealing with my problems specifically?

Also I don't know how triggers work but this might trigger someone so if your family's consistent suggestions to you about how to deal with your mental health trigger you, skip this post or if you could, drop a comment about how you deal with it. 

So I've started medication finally and it seems to be working I guess, definately more level but it might need a tweak. I don't know that's for the doc to decide. Anyways, my family is not really down with mental health. My mom is actively against medication for it and is always affraid of it, my dad is always talking about X study that solved people's ""learned depression"" with out meds. My SO is always bringing up ""when are you going off your meds?"" ""They change your brain chemistry. It's scary!"" and also brings up studies about no meds.

I never wanted to go on meds! I never wanted to feel the way I do! I didn't want any of this but it happened. But guess what, this medicine lets me function. Without it I shut down. I already don't want to take the damned stuff so when they tell me all of this stuff it feels like they're telling me I don't actually have anything disordered, I'm just not thinking right or thinking myself into it. 

It seems like everyone freaked out when I told them I was going on lithium and I don't know how to deal with that. To try and justify taking the meds is hard enough, having to figure out if they're working or not is even harder as I don't realize what's happening to my mood and behavior if I'm in the thick of it. If you add on top of that the feelings of guilt and anxiety my family is putting in my head with their suggestions, it really breaks me down.

How have you guys gotten people to back off from suggesting you don't need meds or should try some sort of alternative? What was it like for you when you started medication? How long did it take you to find the right thing?

I've been unmedicated since then without incident. I think the fact that I know I have bipolar is enough, even though everyone says medication is a must.

 I now understand that if I'm not sleeping and feeling extremely happy I'm probably going hypomanic and should probably get some sleep/ take it easy for a few days.

* I was just recently (at 25 years old) diagnosed with Bipolar (NOS). This explains a hell of a lot in my life. I started on Depakote, (worked my way up to) 1500mg ER a night.
* So far, my life has been much better. I have handled certain situations very well that would have normally thrown me into an episode; but it's only been 3 weeks since my diagnosis/since I started medication.
* I'm still getting bad anxiety. Social anxiety is what afflicts me the worst. Just being in a room with a lot of people makes my heart beat bad. I avoid going out for this reason and am a social recluse. Just texting a girl I like can become a struggle because this shit will happen. I have had panic attacks pretty badly in the past, but I don't know if this is from having anxiety or from being bipolar, now. I have not had a panic attack since I started the Depakote, however, but I have had once instance where I felt I was close to.
* My next appointment with my PDOC is in 3 weeks. Last time I saw him was the second visit. I mentioned my anxiety to him then, he asked me if I wanted something for it, he gave me hydroxyzine, but so far it has not been working at all. But it's only been less than a week. How long should I try it for before I give up on it?

**My question?**

Is my anxiety bad enough on its own to get on medication? Could it be a symptom of my bipolar disorder, and if so, will that go away with time? How do I bring up to my PDOC that I ""researched this or that, and I think this or that will help.""?

Worst, when I have tried to talk to him about this void, this falling into the bleak hole in my heart, he tells me ""I know that feeling. Everyone feels that way once in awhile."" I realize he truly has no idea. And I feel very badly for talking about it. 

So, here I am. Two benadryls later, I find myself wanting to take the entire bottle. I find myself wanting to be self destructive. It is so ridiculous, this entire thing. Seems like so much energy wasted.  So pointless. I find myself wanting nothing more than to simply dissipate, my atoms simply let loose of their bonds and I am like smoke in the air.

 I am tired of talking about myself. I am tired of the medications because all they have done is bring me painful, brutally honest clarity. I have been made to look into the goddamn abyss with predictable results. It not only has stared back, it seems to have me in a choke hold.

I have no desire to draw anymore. Simply don't care. I can't fucking spell anymore-have to keep looking things up or using auto correct because I simply cannot recall the proper spelling. Am not having sex, because although he would never admit it, I have skeeved out my husband. I can't even do myself, because all it does it remind me of the latter, and how I am intolerable even to myself.

So, yes, I guess I can't say the meds haven't been doing *something*.

Ugh. Thanks for letting me rant. Better than digging a hole and screaming into it, right?

I feel like if I truly accepted myself and my disorder, I would face it dead on and be able to realize that I need help. I decided to do group therapy this week. I even called and set up an evaluation for this week. I feel determined to keep it but who knows how I feel in the minutes before I have to go?

I have been feeling pretty good today because I finally feel like I am going to get help. I truly want to become a better person and stop running from my issues. I feel super motivated, and super exuberant. I hope this good mood and focus lasts.   

I have no idea how to accept the fact that at any minute something, (a mere bad thought, a minor annoyance, a BUNCH of minor annoyances piling up high, ETC) could potentially piss me off so badly, make me feel so depressed, or make me feel so done with life that I want to hurt myself or be self-destructive. 
 
I honestly don't know what being mentally ""well"" means. Does it mean I DON'T continuously overspend my money until I am in the negatives every month? Does it mean I actually consider my safety? Does it mean I actually consider the fact that I am a person who deserves respect and love?

I found out that the panic attacks were likely caused by my brain trying to swing into a manic cycle. My medication (lamictal) was trying to stop it from happening but it wasn't doing the job by itself. The doctor put me on lithium and seraquil to work with the lamictal and it seems to be working. 

I was hospitalized for a week and I was feeling so much better. However, I got out this Friday and in one night I went from being ecstatic and excited to crashing into a hopeless crushing despair and frustration. 

I figure it's because I was numb to my situation until I got out and now I'm trying to process what happened to me. I went from a structured environment to not knowing what to do with myself. I went from talking to multiple therapists every day to having nobody that can handle the gravity of my thoughts and feelings. I feel so alone with all of this because I can't talk to anyone except my therapist because it's so heavy. It drags people down and I don't like to do that to my friends and family. But I'm so lonely and scared and I feel like I'm drowning in this.

I'm proud that I got the help I was needing. But I'm so frustrated. The last year has been one of the worst cycles I've had since I was 15. Usually I at least hit the manic part and everything is great and awesome and exciting for a while. This year it has been a deep unrelenting depression.

The medicine is starting to help and I'm hopeful that it will. But I'll have to live with this and manage it and be aware of it for the rest of my life.

My sister has just been diagnosed with Bipolar I and I'm scared about how I can help her. She is 25 and experienced a manic episode on Saturday. She went out to get fuel and ended up driving for 4 hours. When she called my parents she claimed she didn't know where she was and how she got there. She was erratic and was taking to a professional who diagnosed her.

Some background on her... She has always suffered from depression, but in her teens and even to this day she has been a white liar. Nearly every second phrase out of her mouth was a lie. As a outcome of this we have grown apart over the last few years, and I struggle every day to speak with her as I do not know what she is saying is truth.

Now, I understand she has been given this diagnosis and is on fairly strong medication which is being administered by my parents. The doctor did want to admit her to a psyche ward for a week so her medication could be corrected but the family decided that home care would be more suitable. So my parents have taken the week off to help her out. 

I don't know what I can do to help.. When I saw her today she was walking around in a drug induced haze and I just feel like there is nothing I can do to help her out....

If it truly is bipolar then what can I do to help?

She knows I love her and am here for her but I'm feeling lost and useless.

I am severely worried I'm going to wake up tomorrow and she has killed herself. My parents let her go out with a friend tonight to the movies but is this really a good idea at this early stage? Should she be under house arrest until the meds start working.

She's on a pretty good cocktail of medications, Abilify Sertraline and something else, that have kept her pretty stable until this point. She just upped her abilify dosage (which might explain some of the tiredness) but the point remains that she's been in a depressive slump for the past couple of weeks.

I am planning on proposing next month.

I know that this will continue to be a stressor on our relationship and feel like my expectations are aligned with that - but it's still scary to think that this is going to be a recurring thing for the rest of our lives. It's not scary enough to make me want to reconsider the proposal itself, but it is causing me to think about the timeline some.

I know the statistics on bipolar divorce (Never tell me the odds, kid), but I also know that it can be done. Her illness is really well managed, and for her I think work is really more about having a healthy routine than the money (especially after we get hitched - we could comfortably live on my income alone), but it's still unsettling to hear that she's that far into her depression that those kinds of choices would happen.

I also went through 2 year period where I was clinically depressed, and medications really helped me put a floor on my thinking and stand back up. I don't want to judge her for not being able to do the same, but I also don't know what my place is in those moments where she doesn't want to get out of bed or do anything.

I have a dual diagnosis of Bipolar II and Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm not sure where the BPD plays into this process, but I know that when I'm in a mild manic state due to BD the effects can be really beneficial for my creative output.

I've recently begun treatment again, and this time I hope to stay on course for as long as possible. I've been a little ambivalent about treatment in the past. My biggest worry is that any medication that effectively levels out my mood will also eliminate the times where I feel especially lively, motivated and able to make a decent amount of artwork.

Right to it, I'm bipolar with severe anxiety and ocd tendencies. I have been on and off a slew of medication since my first hospital visit, six years ago.

I've been medicated with different things right up until I got pregnant with my son almost a year ago. During the pregnancy I went medication free, besides 100mg of Seroquel at night. During the whole pregnancy I was really great. My moods weren't bad, I worked through the problems I had and I was managing, almost drug free. Two months after my son was born, I went to the doctor seeking help because I had crashed.

Now getting to current and my problem at hand. I now take a few medications: 

Lithium 900mg
Seroquel 300mg extended release
Zoloft 50mg
Ativan 1mg as needed
Clonazepam 1mg as needed
(Now discontinued) Oxeazepam
Imovane 5mg

A few days ago I started hallucinating and having short term memory loss. My hands trembled and I sweated and felt hot. I babbled about random crap that made no sense and I would sit and stare off into space for hours on end. I couldn't take care of my son and I couldn't drive.

Now, at this moment, I am weening off the oxazepam by hospital and doctors orders as that was the only thing that was recently added to my roster of meds. But as I go through terrible withdrawals, I get scared, sad, and worried for what will happen next. 

My father whom is manic depressive, told me to start at square one. Completely start fresh and add meds IF I absolutely need it. But I don't know how I can do it without the lithium and zoloft. But I did it without them while pregnant? 

I'm so sorry for rambling or giving you guys a head ache. It's so hard to keep my thoughts together and in line. I just need help. I am basically socially handicapped and don't have many friends to talk to, and none of my family can really relate. So please, if you have experience, advice, or anything, I could really use help from people I know who at least understand some of this craziness.

You normalize me to the point that normal people think I'm normal when I am clearly not and never wanted to be.  If high school me met me now he'd kill me.  Maybe I was a silly angsty rebellious teen, but at least I was myself and had real, reactive, fluctuating emotions.

But I can forgive the mood stabilizing frustration because mania has its negatives that you relieve me of.  But the reading comprehension?  No way, dude.  I'd rather run nude through a public park and stab a homeless person I thought was reading my mind too closely, then get sent to prison and read in the library there than not be able to fucking read.  

How the hell am I supposed to get a graduate degree or get into med school not being able to read more than 5 pages an hour?  I'd rather start sawing maniacally into the gut of a patient I believed was working for the NSA during my residency and get sent to do family practice in Arkansas for eternity than be stuck in a dead-end job, because so few BS's in a hard sciences find decent paying or satisfying work in their field.  

I'd rather get caught making DMT in my graduate lab because I thought I needed to reach the green little men on the other side of the edges of the universe to achieve true enlightenment, then get kicked out than be stuck in my parent's house unable to find a job because I can't study hard enough to continue education.

And yet, psychiatrists think the meds they give us are working and they're making good citizens out of us.  Get that garbage out of my face.  Being functional in a dysfunctional world doesn't make me sane, it only means I am now compliant.  Nothing more.  Was I insane?  Sure, delusions of increasing complexity over the course of 3 months is difficult to snap out of, but undeniably ridiculous in hindsight.  But the logical progression and worldview I crafted in that time is rooted in more truth than any shit I live through in day to day life.

I have a theory that mentally ill people, such as schizophrenics, bipolar, autistic, and depressed people, simply view the world in such a way that the hypocrisy of reality and the irrational, inconsistent cultural and social values simply doesn't add up.  Our lack of coping skills over time leads to pathological irregular brain function.  But the true schizophrenia is the daily acceptance of the shitty amoral life that we all live in the face of all the hideous corruption, overwhelming materialism, and nonchalant dehumanization of nearly the vast majority of the globe and everyone below a certain socioeconomic standard.  All the while we're seeing ourselves in a golden, glowing light of goodness wrapped in a blanket of religious vows and shallow, desperate encouragement by others in the same situation.  But I digress.

As much as I respect psychiatrists' work and admire their service, I don't think they realize how debilitating, humiliating, and costly these meds are.  I've only been diagnosed for a year, but I've tried at least a 6 drugs and even though lithium is the most favorable of them all, I'd really rather not take it.  The only reason I don't quit taking them is because I simply don't give a damn not to anymore.  If I stop, maybe I'll feel better and get to another hypomanic state and start getting my life back together.  But life will still be an experiment in nihilism: a truth I was convinced of long before I showed bipolar symptoms, and will continue to regardless of my mental state.  So fuck it.  And fuck you, lithium.

One of my best friends is a medicated bipolar person. I apologize if this post comes across as condescending or ignorant due to my lack of bipolar disorder, but I don't know where else to turn except to others who have experienced this for themselves and can give me some insight. (I can't really ask my best friend because she has received treatment since her diagnosis.)

One of my roommate's most prominent symptoms is her wide-ranging mood swings. She laughs and jokes when she's in her ""normal"" (elevated?) state, but ten minutes later she is extremely irritable and takes it out on me and our other roommate.

She told me about another symptom that really bothers me: hearing voices. She says she ""can't hear them"" when taking her medication, which is why she won't let a pill pass her lips.

She is quite reluctant to talk to me about her condition/illness, but I got her to tell me those two important pieces of information.

While I understand her brain is not in balance (at least that's what I've read about BP) I am tired of her walking on me and snapping at me during her depressive episodes. I want to stand up to her; however, I am so scared that this will send her into into a rage.

I also read that suicide rates are up to 20% for untreated bipolar disorder. My roommate has never experienced suicidal thoughts or actions (that I know of), but I don't want her to go through a major depression and try to off herself. 

Is there anything I can do for her? I know that just straight up telling her ""You need to get back to your therapist and take your meds"" is a HUGE no-no that could trigger an episode, but she's really wearing on me emotionally. I've been told to ""keep the peace"" by other people, but there is not much peace here. Being assertive doesn't work. Avoiding her when she's depressed doesn't work. Just ""taking it"" doesn't work. 

Once again, I am not trying to bash my roommate. I want the best for her, yet I feel that I don't deserve to be her doormat/emotional punching bag.

^(I'm waiting on disability to come through so that I can get a bit more assistance than before. Read: insurance, meds paid for [or at least assistance] etc.)

^(I'm currently not working and I dislike working with the public. I prefer behind a desk and behind a phone. See: call centres.)

^(My SO is the only person in the universe [other than you guys] that knows I have this disorder. She's still learning about how it works and how it affects me and stuff.)

^(She works [basically] full time and brings in enough to support us here and there. But we do live with her family. [Her mother, stepdad and brother.] I have no family. [I don't know my dad, I have no siblings, and my mother passed away four years ago this October.])

^(We do not have a car. Everyone shares one car. If the car isn't available we either are unable to go anywhere, we walk within the immediate area, or we take the free tram. Busses here are insanely expensive.) 

^(Today set me off slightly. When my SO wasn't working and her family pressured the issue some, she ignored it and said she was looking. That was true. Prior to this I had some five or so interviews for call centres which happened to be way too far to borrow the car for or to catch a ride, as well as much too far for a bus.)

^(Regardless, if they pushed the issue with her she would claim she was looking. I put in every single application for any job she ever applied for. I wrote the essay portions. I told them why they should hire [me] her. I was the one who did it because, honestly, at the time, she was pretty unmotivated to do anything about it.)

^(She has a job now, [thanks to me] and obviously thanks to her interview skills. Not that we didn't spend days on end going over interview questions specifically for that company. I didn't go over specific techniques. This had been a long time coming. She has worked at another company before, and would have basically a guaranteed position with them if she wanted. But she refused.)

^(Now that she has a job and I don't- everything's been fine. We help out with groceries. We help with whatever they need if they need it. We offer constantly to assist, to take them out to eat, to put gas in the car, to take the car to get cleaned, to buy rug doctors to clean the carpets, we take out the trash [which is literally, no lie, riddled with around {easily} four or five, sometimes six or seven, boxes of empty beer bottles].)

^(We don't complain directly to their face. When we used to ask for money we didn't push the issue; if they could they did. And if they couldn't they wouldn't.)

^(I'm getting off track. Today, more specifically when my SO was getting ready for work and went into the kitchen to make a quick breakfast and to fill her water bottle for the day, her mom and stepdad ask her if I ever intend to get a job.)

^(My SO defended me somewhat, but eventually, [as she tends to do] gave in to what they were asking by turning around and [thankfully] telling me what they said. I apologized profusely and began to feel utterly guilty about not having a job.)

^(I reiterated that once I had/have disability [assuming all goes well] that I would get a small, part-time position. Maybe something miniscule. Even if I'm against it, I could probably put up with it for a few hours a day, two or three days a week.)

^(She agreed wholly and left for work. She's there around fifteen minutes early. She calls me, [I have slight attachment issues and seriously dislike being alone] and we are having a nice chat. I text her a list of things to do today that she forgot, how much we miss each other already, etc., etc., etc... Then she asks me, ""So... do you plan on getting a job- ever?"")

^(I'm kind of taken aback by this statement. I tell her it's not like that. It sounds worse than it actually is when you say it like. She says ""Okay, but, do you? Maybe you could work at xx location. Or what about xxx? Or there's even an xxxx over near where I work, you could work there."" I'm kind of silent and trying not to be rude so I just say, ""Maybe. I'd rather just wait and see I guess."")

^(This is my second time applying for disability. Previously I was denied so I appealed and all that good stuff.)

^(She starts in again, ""You know, if you get denied this time, you should stop trying. Just find a job. It'll be better anyways."" I wish I could just nod and she would know what I meant. But I just say, ""It's really not as bad as it sounds."" She just kind of brushes it off and then has to go into work.)

^(Now I'm sitting here, feeling like a failure. I doubt I'll approved for disability. I can't and don't want to tell her family. [They are hugely hispanic and people spread rumours and lies about anyone any chance they get. Plus, there's one other person who bipolar in the family and she refuses help. She's done some pretty stupid stuff regarding the kids she has with my SO's uncle and etc. So the only experience anyone in the entire family has with the disorder is with her.] I feel like I should just get a job and stop sitting around being useless. I feel so epically pointlessly useless at this point. I'm officially at my lowest point in a long time.)

I see it as a good thing because for the first time in SEVEN YEARS I don't want to die. My medicine kept the suicidal thoughts coming on a daily basis.

Saw my Pdoc today and it was like 'things are legitimately a lot better'. Memories from the manic episode and feelings of shame are starting to feel distant.

Anyways, this is great. I think this forum helped quite a bit as there isn't a support group nearby really and I felt a lot better knowing what a variety of people's experiences and thoughts were.

Just to throw it out there, for what its worth-
Lithium has worked really well for me supplemented by Fish Oil and a supplement/over counter called NAC (N-Acetylcysteine). I started taking both of these daily over a month and a half ago. My Pdoc reccomended the NAC and it has some solid if emerging studies for its effectiveness on bipolar depression- if you aren't having any luck in the downswing and other meds aren't desirable perhaps ask your Pdoc about it.

ANYWAYS-
I know very well this is a lifelong illness and maintenance is key- and unfortunately its a reality that at some point 'This too shall pass' and being prepared to deal with that somewhat is key. Anyone have any experiences on this? be real/blunt. Come out of nowhere again? Im worried a bit about that

I've been diagnosed with severe anxiety (the symptoms themselves are not severe, but the fact that I have so many symptoms from anxiety makes it severe.) and I am now being told I'm on the bipolar spectrum. 

**Back story:** 

I could believe that I am bipolar, I've had some crappy days where nothing would make me happy, I mean who hasn't? And I've had very few days where I've been in a good mood for no good reason. But the majority of the time I've been a big chubby goofball who is considered to be very lazy. Everyday I would have to take a nap, and I'd be pretty unmotivated to do things, and I was a big time procrastinator. But other than that, I wasn't sad or anything. I've always wanted more, the kind of person who thinks about the things they don't have instead of the things that they already do.

**When it started (The possible down):**

 Alright so a few months ago I started having some strong anxiety. Heart palpitations, always feeling like I was about to throw up, couldn't eat a bite of anything. I think this was actually onset by a stomach bug I had. Some doctors think it might have been because of my new found seasonal allergies. Anyway, I went through about a month of this, being bed ridden, hopeless because of the anxiety, couldn't eat a thing. I lost 20 pounds. The palpitations occurred all the time, every time of the day and night. I was always dizzy also. 

**First Medication:**
So I couldn't take this feeling anymore, the anxiety, the palpitations, I just wanted it to stop. So I went to the doctor to ask for klonopin/clonazapam. I've taken them in the past, and they worked miracles. He says no, it's short term, if you take even two pills you'll get addicted. There is no way I'm giving you klonopin. Mind you this was the doctor's assistant which is a RN. So not being able to convince him that this medicine worked for me, he gave me Buspar. Buspar gives people very very mixed results. Some people get more anxious, some people it cures them like a miracle, and some people think it's a placebo or a sugar pill. I took literally a crumb off of Buspar and within hours I felt like I could run 10 miles. I was super energized and somewhat happy.. The next day going off of the same crumb from the day passed, I was super energetic, and extremely euphoric, I was so happy about life. Then that night it went away, and I started feeling a bit down. The next day (day 3) I took the same crumb, and instead of lasting two days, the feeling only lasted me one day. I was extremely social, talked to my girlfriend's parents (this is absolutely not me!) and excited about things. The feeling wore off later that same day. I go on to take the same crumb on day 4 and the feeling wore off mid day. I go on to take bigger doses never exceeding 2.5mg of the recommended 10mg a day dose. After 3-4 weeks, what I thought was the medicine started making me feel really emotional. I couldn't tell if it was because I wasn't taking enough of it, or because my body was telling me not to take it anymore. So I stopped.

**Ups..:**

Ever since I stopped I've had severe bouts of what I would think is mania. (This is what I need you guys to confirm.) Mind you that I've never had these feelings before I took Buspar. I mentioned it to my psych and she said that Buspar increases seratonin indirectly, and definitely could have threw me into mania and this bipolar roller coaster. 

The feeling sometimes comes late at night around 11 or 12 before I'm about to go to sleep. It's sort of a tingling feeling in the head, and all my tiredness goes away. I feel like a kid crying who is being tickled to hush up before they get in trouble. I don't want this feeling, but I'm being mentally tickled to feel happy. I get super energized, not necessarily body wise, like I want to run 10 miles. But like I want to organize my whole bedroom, now, at 3-4am. I have no sense of tiredness and my brain feels like it's about to turn into cotton candy and unicorns. I don't want this feeling at all because sometimes it's very overwhelming. 

I've noticed sometimes in the mirror that my pupils will contract and dilate very fast back and forth. I think it feels awful, especially at 4am and you feel like wandering through your house but you don't want people to think you're crazy by seeing you up that late wide eyed. Sometimes I get the feeling I'm going to do something bad because I have more fuzziness and energy in my mind that I can handle. I don't think I would actually do something bad, but coupled with anxiety I can't help but over think that scenario. I also sort of get the feeling at my upper back and neck, I can only describe it to sort of being like a chronic chill. Not exactly like getting the chills but a light sensation that resembles it at all times while in these episodes.

**Summary:**

My psych says she wants to put me on lamactil but gave me 3 weeks. It might be because she wants to see if I sort of settle down by myself if it was truly because of Buspar. Some reviews of Buspar say that they only took it for 8 days, and they're still feeling horrible side effects a month later. I took it for about 3 weeks with an energetic sensitivity to it. A few days ago I felt completely normal again. No unnecessary not explainable energy, but my anxiety which was sort of mostly absent throughout my mania came back a bit. This lasted for 2 or 3 days. Being my normal sort of lazy self. I went to bed yesterday and woke up at 3 or 4 extremely happy for some reason, but was able to go back to sleep. Now I'm on a much milder form of what I think is mania compared to when I got off of buspar. My brain doesn't feel like it's about to explode into cotton candy, nor does it feel like somebody is tickling it all over physically. But I do feel really awake and alert with the chilly upper back and neck feeling.

I think (I'm hoping) that I may have been bipolar my whole life, but had it so little that I wouldn't even think twice about myself being in a bad mood or just a little irritable one day. And that Buspar took me up up up a rollercoaster and my butt just dropped and now I'm on a crazy loop until I slowly settle back down. 

There have been some days (The aforementioned few days where I felt normal) where I was planning on marching into my appointment with my psych and telling her thank you for your help but I seem to be back together again. I may have acute bipolar that was just flared up by Buspar, but I'd rather live my life unmedicated. But then there are times where I feel like calling her office right when it opens and demanding the prescription to lamactil right then and there.

**Extra question:** Is anybody having memory problems? This might be related to anxiety or my mind being under so much stress from this all. But if I say something, the millisecond I stop speaking, I have to question myself if I actually said something or if I was just thinking it. And if I am in a room sitting down, I wouldn't remember the walk into that room. It's sort of like when you drive somewhere and you get there, but you don't remember driving and you're like holy crap my brain was on autopilot. It's constant right now, sometimes it's mild but sometimes it gets really bad to where I don't want to speak because I'll freak myself the hell out. Even if I concentrate on myself talking, I'll immediately have to question it after I'm done talking.

I was never rewarded/praised when I did well, only severely punished/beaten if I didn't make first chair in State Honor Band as a mere freshmen, or couldn't master Chopin Ballade No. 1 in G minor within a month, and/or other very very challenging things in that nature. I remember I started bursting in tears in public when I saw a commercial of a young boy doing falling asleep on his desk while finishing up his homework, and his mother comes in the room and puts a blanket over him, kisses his head, and turns off the light smiling; I was forced to do extra work/study for SATs/AP tests years ahead of time until 1:45 AM every night. If I were to fall asleep on my desk out of exhaustion after hell week in water polo / marching band camp when I have to be in the pool by 4:30 AM in the morning, have class 0-7 periods, swim practice immediately 2 hours, then 4 hours of field marching, 3 hours of piano, finish up school work, then I would violently be awoken with her hand slamming my head on my desk. 

Anyways, Senior year of high school, after sending all the applications to various Ivy Leagues in November, needless for me to say, I was just in constant fear of rejection until March. Thankfully, Harvard contacted me saying they were interested in interviewing me for further consideration, and I went til the very end of all the stages of interviews but unfortunately ended up getting an email that told me I was wait-listed. Simply put, I was annihilated mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, just completely shattered. I only had maybe a couple hours at best before my mother found out, for she monitors all my personal emails/texts. To my surprise, when she personally read the letter from Harvard saying I was wait-listed, she was unnaturally happy. She called everyone right away, bragging that her wonderful son got wait-listed to Harvard. She told me I did a good job. 

Ironically, though all my life, I've always always wanted to be approved by my parents, when I heard them approve of me for the first time in my life, I fucking hated it. My mother noticed that I wasn't quite as ecstatic as her and was confused and remarked, ""You should be happy. This is the happiest moment of your life."" Out of all the wrong things my parents did throughout my life, that remark was the absolute worst they did to my 17 year old self. I immediately planned to commit suicide in the most vengeful, spiteful way possible to destroy my parents. I wanted the whole world to know my parents do not deserve any respect for raising a prodigy. Intrinsically, my soul/ego/concept of self literally ended the moment she said that remark. My mother changed too, she ~~encouraged~~ forced me to go to that beach trip my fellow senior peers have been planning. I went. There were drugs. I was the stereotypical kid who knew nothing about drugs and thought kids who did  them were absolutely very bad people. But I didn't care about anything anymore and took 2 pills and smoked marijuana for the first time that day.

Everything changed when I started feeling the roll. The artificial feeling of happiness was just so ancient to me. I remembered happiness. I was in love. I forgave. I appreciated. I wanted to keep living. I felt hope. Even after I came down from the ecstasy, this overwhelming new positive mentality remained. From here it just goes down hill. I literally conclude that ecstasy is nothing but a positive connotation and in 2 months I somehow managed to drop 35+ pills, with my ""goody/proper"" reputation among society I managed to make dozens of good kids to try ecstasy for the first time. One close girl friend of mine, properly raised who I convinced to try ecstasy,  [this is a whole another story] but in summary, she ended up committing suicide in front of me 3 days before my senior graduation day which also happened to be my 18th birthday. So essentially I was depressed all throughout my childhood, took ecstasy, became manic, which eventually turned hypermanic, and then the suicide, which triggered the beginning of severe delusional psychosis.

Though heavily influenced by the Asian taboo/stigma where any sign of mental illness is just absolutely fucking unacceptable, it became bad enough where it was undeniable to my parents that I cannot go far across to the Ivy's in the east coast by myself. Regardless, to try to hide any irregularities from church/family members, they decided to send me to UCLA which is close by, and told everyone our family decided UCLA was the best choice for financial reason. 

My first year of UCLA, I became insanely religious (read the bible way too many times over and over again, it was completely annotated/highlighted/sticky notes, from original translation, books that were taken out of the bible i.e. bel of serpent, mary, judas, etc. ALL of it.). I gave myself an extremely hard time because me desiring to be a truly genuine person was selfish but eventually I managed to transcend that ego problem and somehow destroyed my ego and believed to be a genuine person. idk i was really into theological crap like that. Eventually, Christianity wasn't ""perfect"" enough for me and I found all these new age spiritual crap (indigo/crystal children I desperately wish I never ever found out about this bullshit information...) which highly associated itself with the new world or the new world order or all the conspiracy crap and the world ending in 2012 and illuminati, annunaki, david icke, etc. etc. etc. I watched hours and hours and hours of conspiracy videos in front of my roommates without sleep. I completely detoxed my body, stopped all drugs cold turkey, became vegan, stopped masturbating, was obsessed with the law of attraction, OOBE, astral projection, meditation, chakras, etc etc.; I became one of those crazy activists who held signs, I became a radical libertarian (aka anarchist). After I ""discovered"" I was truly an ""indigo/crystal child"" I eventually realized with 100% (but I really mean 150%) pure faith I was actually the second Jesus Christ and I had to warn everyone in UCLA that the end is near, Swine flu vaccines are governments way to microchip and put us in concentration camps, etc. etc. What was hilarious, however, was compared to other crazy mentally bat shit crazy people out there in the world, I was extremely coherent and fluent with my presentation of information, I radiated with overwhelming amount of positivity, charisma, passion, and pure pure pure faith that I attracted a dozen *followers* throughout UCLA. I can go on and on and on about all the embarrassing things I did my quarter of college. I went to literally every. single. christian club campus ministry. and prepared my own sermon, and called out their pastor leaders in front of hundreds for not being a real disciple of God, with back of evidences quoting from the bible practically memorized. Looking back to it now, it's truly terrifying how I was walking around earth with 150% pure faith with absolutely no doubt whatsoever. I still remember how it felt like 5 years ago. I walked around mother earth with a overwhelming spiritual connection with every molecule in this ""world."" I walked around and saw miracles everywhere. Everything ANYTHING mundane was extraordinary and my mind somehow magically connected the dots and KNEW it was a direct sign from God. Everything around me just reinforced that I was RIGHT. It just felt real. It WAS real. It was my reality. How can any of my delusions be fake when i'm overwhelmingly drowning in this very very real feeling of intense direct connection with God himself every moment?

But of course, though I deluded myself in thinking everything in my life is perfect, miraculous, beautiful, fulfilling, etc. at that moment, there were many consequences/realities that my mind completely blocked that was inconsistent or threatened my 150% pure faith. I had severe headaches, dreaminess, complete detachment from reality, restless leg syndrome, blank stares, and just weird neurologically abnormal things, and of course  I didn't always radiate extreme positivity, charisma, beacon of hopegiving light all the time. But UGH! I somehow stumbled upon this New Age Indigo/Crystal Children crap that basically is this bullshit new age crap that gives false hope to parents who have children who have autism or other mental illness. You can google research yourself. There's a lot of detail but essentially all the neurological abnormalities I felt were apparently normal cleansing transformations indigo children feel when they *evolve* into crystal children. I desperately believed it fully. and I think this was the biggest factor that prevented me from seeking psychiatric help, even though I vaguely possibly may know deep deep deep somewhere inside my completely traumatized conscious that quite possibly, there might be something wrong with me.

Anyways, one typical outrageous day in UCLA I got this idea (probably from God) that I need to offer my genetically resonating/activating/evolving indigo/crystal children brain to science. I went to the neurology department got emails of all 15ish neurology-related professors and emailed them that I am providing a great opportunity to the world of my new evolving brain phenomena. One of the professors after reading my email sent an email to a counselor who emailed me to see her. What was I to fear? I had absolute confidence that I could convince anyone that though this is all shocking news, I am 150% right. That counselor referred me to a psychologist, who referred me to a psychiatrist, and my parents got notified, and that's when my very very spiritually elevated happy self felt attacked, and became paranoid. 

From here there's a lot of my parents actually facing their problems for the first time and admitting they fucked up big time. I accused them of all sorts of inhumane things, believing my mother had always been possessed by Satan all this time, etc. And a lot of wild emotional rollercoasters for my family. As a result our family was sent to a family psychologist, who referred my mom to a psychiatrist and she is now on proper meds and she truly is a different person now then she was for 20 years of my life. I eventually gave in and decided to take my first 25 mg Lamotragine pill on January 1, 2010. (because numerology and all illogical things like that were a significant deal) From that day on, it was me realizing that things I thought were pure white paint was actually a very very dark grey paint, and I (who had been completely out of touch in reality for 9 months)  then had to figure out what was normal/real and what was not, separating black and white out of the grey paint pixel by pixel, one step at a time. From that day on, was a constant testing to see what i should be labeled as, and constant trial and error battle of getting the right dosage and mixture of anti-psychotics and mood stabilizers which had a heavy polarization effect on my mood sometimes;  took 3 years to finally get it right for now. I took up to 400 mg Lamictal, 1800 mg of Lithium Carbonate, 900 mg of Gabapentin, ??mg Risperidone, 12 mg of Abilify, 72 mg of Concerta, 80 mg of Propranolol, but in the end the medication caused more problems than my diagnosed bipolar disorder, and I cut everything except 200 mg of lamictal. My new psychiatrist believes I'm not even bipolar at all for I've been completely stable, functional, normal healthy adult for more than a year. 

Anyways, back to my question. My GPA is low because the first year I was a psychotic anarchist who believed in God rather than grades, the second year was better but still not consistent because of me adjusting to my meds. 3rd and 4th year were a lot of actual grown-up decision and changed majors so it was a bit chaotic. 
I found out about the Actuarial profession and how it was a very stable, stress free job which is good for my potential condition, and I passed my first exam and got several calls from insurance companies.... GPA is a BIG factor in major insurance companies and the cut off point is 3.2 to 3.5 at least, but my GPA is a 2.9 and I don't know what to tell them when they ask why it's so low. Telling the company, I take antipsychotics so I can function normally and talk to you is honest but seems detrimental. What can I say that is honest, and euphemistic and politically correct, and understandable/forgivable?  ","['pobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

However: I go through 1-2 week periods of being unable to shower or get out of bed and my hypomanic episode were usually on the back burner to debilitating depression.

The past couple months however I've noticed a cycle of depression, a normal week or couple of days, and then slowly built hypomanic where I clean up the mess my depression left and am super productive. However the depression feels like it's still there lurking. But sometimes the hypomania leads to questionable decisions, a year ago I would drink a lot and sometimes smoke etc. Sometimes in recent months I've drank as well (I am only 20 so it's questionable taking of alcohol). I have been pretty good with this the past couple months but I still make questionable decisions as far as my spending and texting people I shouldn't or saying things I shouldn't.

I bring this up because I am at work right now and was exhausted and didn't want to be here. I still don't but I can feel myself skittering around doing unnecessary cleaning and such and just want to go home even though I know I have the next two days off.

I know that come my next workday I will have a lot of anxiety about having to get to work leading up to eat and won't want to be there, but also feel that hypomanic buzz.

Does anyone have any tips on how to stop the full blown hypomania? I become very productive but I also burn myself out so much so that I end up depressed.

I'm looking for a new psychiatrist and therapist at the moment because they seem to think my medications are doing me well right now and that these are just small scale symptoms that will never go away even though I have two bipolar I family members one of which has been very stable for some time.

It's clear with this wall of text I'm quite up right now and feel almost disattached so any words of support or advice would be much appreciated, I don't share this kind of stuff often.

With gratitude,

I found some support in here and decided to check myself into a mental clinic. I would like to post updates about my recovery, to maybe help others, but to also really keep myself positive. I want to start by saying that the week in the hospital was probably the toughest week of my life. The in take process was especially hard. First I was examined in one mental hospital. That part was ok. Staff was really nice, and caring. They let me have a cigarette which was against their policy. The next step was to have a medical review at a local hospital. That was pure hell. I was there for about 18hrs. I was secluded to a small section, pretty much a corridor, where they kept high risk crazies. I tried to get some sleep, but then they started playing light jazz over the speakers. The music just drilled into my brain. I had no sleep, was crying periodically and overall insane. The nurses there paid little to no attention to us, and I had no one to talk to. They had to have a security guard in there as well. They were even worse. Most of them looked down at us, and treated us more like an inconvenience. Nothing to read, nothing to do, just stare at the walls, and perhaps pace around for a few hours. I had no updates about my situation until it was almost time for me to be moved to my treatment program. The clinic that I went to was a breath of fresh air. All the staff was super nice and helpful. They let me smoke as soon as I got in, and let me tell you, no cigarette tasted that good in my life. I was put into an acute care unit. There I met with a psychiatrist every day. After I told them the drug combination I was on previously, the doc informed me that this combination is known to cause mania. When I heard this I was floored. It was so frustrating to hear that. They changed my meds, and it was like night and day. I became clear headed, and my mania symptoms were going away. The until was somewhat strict. They had to check up on me every 15min, and we could only go out for smokes at designated times. They did not let us keep lighters or ciggs, and would hand them out when we went outside. But overall I liked it there. They had a piano I could play, and I met some other fellow crazies. After four days there, I was moved to a less strict unit. They needed a bed, and apperently they thought I was ready for the move. Im not quite sure they were right. It was hard to get accustomed to the new enviroment. The new unit focused more on addiction issues. They thought I was a good fit because I had addiction problems in my past. I felt a little cheated, as I wanted to work on bipolar rather then my addiction. For the first two days I made no friends. I just paced back and forth in the hallway, looking at the clock. It was getting pretty bad. I figured out a way to hang myself in my room. I even wrote a suicide note. I decided to call my friends and say good bye. However they gave me a little bit of hope that I desperately needed. I held on and made an attempt to make some friends. I ended up organizing a game of spades with three other loonies. We played and laughed and talked. It was really wonderful. For the rest of my time there we all played the game religiously, and kept each other sane. My meds worked better and better. Every day I got a little bit more clearer, and my depression got a little bit less. I just got out a day ago. It was such a relief to be out of there. My friend picked me up and I spend the day with him. Today I made a list of all the things that I needed to do, and did my best to complete them. I ended up going to an NA meeting, which was ridiculously hard to sit through, but I did it. Tomorrow I start my IOP, and I again made a list of all the things that I need to do. I am hopeful for the future. I never want to end up in this situation again. I need to make an effort to take care of myself, and see my warning signs. I will not be a statistic. I am bipolar but that does not mean I am doomed. I got through today, and I will get through tomorrow. ",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I fold my laundry after I do it, I brush my teeth and am regularly flossing, I shave more often, and I also do my hair more often.  But lately, I just don't want to be around people and I feel more anxious out in the open.  For example I was shopping for groceries and I started feeling anxious.  This is kinda new for me as I'm kind of a tightly wound person but not generally anxious in situations like that.  I'm becoming a hermit and I find that being around other people is very draining.  My Dad lives up North and he came into town for a few days and I like him being around but even then I just like being alone in my room.  Not sure how I can stop feeling this way.

About a week ago, I slipped up and forgot to take my meds one night.  I've done it two or three times before, and my psych doc definitely scolded me those times.  However, she also told me that skipping one dose very rarely wasn't too bad, but that if I missed two or more days I'd put myself at risk of the Dreaded Lamictal Rash.


Anyway.  Like I said, I missed a dose about a week ago, but it was one night and I've been taking it regularly since.  But two or three days ago, I noticed a small red itchy patch on my neck.  That small patch has turned into a splotchy, extremely itchy red rash about four inches long across the front of my neck.


I'm obviously not here for a diagnosis, but what do I do until I can figure out if this is from the Lamictal or not?  I could call my psych doctor, but she's only in her office on Tuesdays so it's going to be a while until she gets my message.  I might as well just schedule an appointment to see her and show it to her at that rate.  But in the meantime, do I quit taking the meds?  I'd hate to start from the beginning, titrating back up from nothing, when this medication has been so helpful to me.  I don't have a general doctor - should I go to an urgent clinic thing tomorrow and get some feedback there?

I woke up in a rage this morning because I had to take my son to school.  

I obviously over slept, didn't wake up with my alarm and neither did the kids.   


*(This medication is fucking up my life.  It isn't helping symptoms but rather seems to be making them worse.  I tried not taking it for two days, but my insomnia came rushing right back and I was too addicted to the sleep that the pills gave me to just stop them, so I got back on.  Was that a mistake?)*   


I had to drive him to school **AND** get out of the car **AND** go *inside* the school to sign him in and the thought of that just riddled me with anxiety and the extreme desire **NOT** to do it.  

I felt as if I was being judged by the lady at the desk because this isn't the first time I've brought my child to school late in the past couple months *(I just can't seem to get it together)*.  

I felt guilt because of this - like they viewed me as a loser mother.  


But alas, I can't allow my bad mental state to effect his schooling.  

He's doing so well and I don't want to screw it up for him like I did the others.  

I mean, they're not doing bad, but I feel they would be doing better if I wasn't so wacked out all the time.  


I got mildly suicidal yesterday because I am so tired of this roller-coaster *(for lack of a better word)*, and I am not sure how much longer I can take it.  


I blew up last night over my older son not wanting to lend us the mouse to his computer to check our other computer - long story.  

The point is I went to his room and screamed at him to let us use the damn mouse.
Stupid I know, but I felt legitimate rage because of this.  


I've been contemplating since last week if I should admit myself to the hospital...
Any time I bring it up to hubby he is a bit dismissive of it as if he doesn't believe I am *that* sick - or not *sick enough* for being admitted as an in-patient.  

But most days I feel just that sick.  

I can't do this anymore and death just seems like a sweet relief and I can't stop thinking about it - it's almost as if I am waiting for the right time to take myself out.  

I don't want to hurt him or my kids by doing something like that, but my love for them is killing me slowly from the inside out.  
It hurts too much to live.    

This is no life to live.  

I just can't do it anymore...  

I am a total burden.  I can't work and social security doesn't seem to want to help me - although I am still fighting for it because I simply cannot work.  

Because of this, I feel tremendous pressure, sadness, guilt and feelings of being worthless and simply in the way.

I've been lurking for a couple weeks and I've learned so much!

I've been debating whether I should see my college's psychological services office to get an evaluation. I'm really anxious about rocking the boat (side effects of meds) because I'm a senior and I'm going to have a very busy rest of 2014 (4 classes and working PT).

I've only told one close friend that I think I might be BP, and she was pretty supportive. Although, my mother saw me researching BP and had an awful response (told me to pray more, it's all in my head, meds are bad, it'll go away, etc.). I'm afraid to tell anyone else right now because of the social stigma around it, and hey I don't even know anything yet.

When I actually stared reading about BP2 and rapid cycling it just makes so much sense. I thought I was just fucked up in a really unique way, but I feel better knowing I'm not alone... even without a support system. I thought I was just getting burned out 2-3 times a year from school, and randomly feeling great in the summer and shitty the rest of the time because of SAD. But after dealing with a bout of depression before summer &amp; now, there doesn't appear to be any way I can control my moods, or sleep cycles.

I think I just need some encouragement to get some help. I'm afraid I'll say something like ""I just don't want to exist anymore"" to the school shrink and I'll get kicked out of school (a few months ago, I read an article about this happening).

* Reading (sometimes I spend money on books, and then i don't read the damn books until half a year later -_-)

* Learning Japanese

Titrated up on my generic welbutrin from 100mg/2x day to 150mg/2x day on Tuesday morning. After 3-4 hours, became *seriously* dizzy, almost passed out and developed major MAJOR stomach cramping. Seriously. As in, nothing but blood was involved. So bad, my son called an ambulance. Checked my vitals: normal. They left. I ended up making an appt. for the following morning.

Next morning, I go to the doctor, explain the situation. I told him I don't get sick-ever. As I had felt perfectly fine and I had eaten NOTHING remotely questionable (other than the bupropion), it seemed probable it was a side effect, and I wanted to make sure things were ok.

Ok, now, here is the important part: He told me that the medication would **not** have caused the symptoms, and I had what was a simple case of gastroenteritis. Blood work was normal, and it was simply a coincidence. Okay then.  HOWEVER, being the curious cat, I went home and Googled the symptoms + welbutrin, and guess what? Severe cramping *is indeed* a possible side effect!

Luckily, temporary. And indeed, today, I'm back to feeling normal. Whew.



Tl;dr: Heads up: severe cramping and extreme dizziness CAN BE A SIDE EFFECT OF WELBUTRIN/GENERIC WELBUTRIN. Doctor was wrong to diagnose gastroenteritis. Medical derp.

I found a sliding scale place, which allows me weekly therapy at $45/session - the cheapest they offer.  That's about $180/month - a steal!  Then add the psychiatrist visit - $90/visit, once a month.  All together, $270/month, out of pocket since I don't have any kind of health insurance.

Honestly, though, that's a steal.  Let's be honest here.  It's not so bad.  It could be SOOOO much worse if I wasn't at a sliding scale center.

Without health insurance, my medications cost me approximately another $200/month.  So, in total, I'm paying about $470/month for my brainspace alone.

This is not accounting for my other medication, such as birth control pills and inhalers for my asthma.

I make barely above minimum wage for my state ($8.50/hour) at a part time job (20 hours/week).  My rent is $550/month.

Before I could even think about what I was saying, I replied, ""I've been unhappy for 13 years and I just wanted a few days where I could just forget about it all and be happy, even if for a little bit.""

I don't know where the answer came from. I had suspected it and had been connecting the dots for a while (I've always had unhappiness and my ex-girlfriend was bipolar, allowing me to observe similarities between us; naturally, however, I know that association is not equality and wrote it off as observation bias) and only saw the big picture when my mother mentioned how alike we are (she has manic-depressive disorder.)

Like I said, that's a highly simplified version of things. I don't know what to think; on one hand, if I do have some disorder, there is an option for treatment and things can get better for me (when done properly, of course; medications that aren't right for me will be awful, which is what happened to my mother.)

I'm extremely restless and irritable. The Lithium seems to be doing nothing even though I'm on 900mg. The risperadal calms me down but im too tired to do anything.  

Keep punching myself in the face/head really hard since I don't easily bruise. I do it until I get dizzy and that the pain makes me more present.

Some Background: After previously being misdiagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and Major Depression, I made an unimpressive suicide attempt my sophomore year of college and was diagnosed with Bipolar II.  Before the bipolar diagnosis, I went through a miserable two years being prescribed every antidepressant every created (Zoloft, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Effexor, etc. etc.)  The best ones did nothing at all, the worst ones were truly hellish.  After being diagnosed with Bipolar, I was put on Depakote (AWFUL).  After that, Abilify, which made me sleep about 18 hours a day.  Miraculously, I managed to graduate college, but got booted from my parents insurance shortly after.  It was over six years until I had insurance again, and during that time I reflected on my experience with all the drugs I'd been on, and said never again.  There were okay times. There were some really hard times.  Once I met my fiance, I stabilized for about six months, but  but eventually started cycling much more intensely than I had in years.  Since I finally had something in my life that I was determined not to lose (people don't always stick around that long), I decided t give meds a try again.  I found a psychiatrist and he put me on Lamicatal.  I have heard really good things about the drug (aside from the whole death rash thing, which scares the ever-loving shit out of me).  However, when started on 25 mg, I found I couldn't sleep for more than two hours in a row, which will leave you a little unhinged after two weeks.  After upping to 50 mg, I started having really intense tightness in my chest, and had a really hard time taking a deep breath.  It started driving me crazy.  I assumed it was anxiety and tried to yoga breath through it, but after about 8 days of feeling like I couldn't breath and again not sleeping, I called my psychiatrist in a ball of tears and essentially begged for mercy.  Mercy, thy name is Ativan.  It is finally helping me sleep, which is wonderful. But the breathing and chest tightness aren't getting any better.  I have always had a high susceptibility to side effects, and chose lamicatal with my doctor as it seemed to have the lowest rate of them (again, aside from the rash).  However, I feel like if things don't get better in another week or so, I am going to come completely unhinged.  In the past few years I have managed to put together some solid relationships, and even excel at my job.  I am terrified of losing this.  I used to think if I could just get these things in my life, my mental state would just sort itself out.  It turns out what I was really doing was holding it inside.  I learned not to speak, to go out to my or behind a door when I needed to kick and scream and cry and panic, so that no one would know.  And it worked, in a sense.  People stuck around.  But it did nothing to quiet my mind, and eventually it was too much to take.  But these medications are making everything so much worse.  Is there something wrong with me?  Has anyone else had this reaction to Lamictal?  My house of cards is falling down, and I am not sure how much longer I can do this. To All of you who who managed to stick this out and finally figure out which cocktail works for you: I bow down to you.  You are fucking badasses, and stronger than I can every hope to be.

I'm 22 female and live in California. I have been struggling with Bipolar Disorder since I was 18. When I went to high school I was an all star. I got amazing grades, took the hardest classes, ran cross country, participated in clubs and had good friends. When I was accepted by UC Berkeley I was beyond excited and couldnt wait to start my college career. 

Then the bipolar hit. I'm type 1 so all I really experienced was severe depression but it started me on the roller coaster that has been the last fuck wow FOUR years. I would try to do well in college, a job, a relationship, and/or living independently and I would start to be successful, start to feel like myself again and then..I would just stop. Like a light switch would go off and the idea of taking a shower became too exhausting to even consider. My world would properly fall apart as I was barely functioning and I would hit rock bottom and my parents would be forced to bail me out. Eventually my dad got tired of bailing me out so my mom -who is also bipolar - has stepped in. 

Currently I live with her and spend my days watching TV/movies, working one day a week as a nanny and playing with my cat. I'm 210lbs (5'5"") and trying to lose weight through weight watchers. I'm taking an antidepressant and taking lithium. I've been in and out of therapy but haven't really found the right therapist. 

I'm fucking miserable and I feel like no matter how hard I try or put into fixing my life, eventually it will just fall apart again and be worse then when I started. I hate myself, I hate how pathetic I have become. I AM SUPPOSE TO DO SOMETHING!!!! BE SOMETHING!!!! I'm tired of failing and letting other people/myself down. I'm tired of this fucking disorder, it stole my life. 

I don't know who to talk to because my mom is a waste of space herself. She just sits around the house doing crafts. I'm thankful she took me in and I tell her so but I in no way want her life. I don't want her unhappy marriage, her crafting away her days till what she dies? If I was 50 and still hadnt gotten my life to mean something I would off myself without a second thought. The only reason I haven't is because of this sliver of hope that maybe my life won't always be this way. MAYBE the meds will kick in and I can live my fucking life. MAYBE I'll have some amazing break through in therapy that will change everything. But it has yet to happen....And feeling like shit gets really old.

Since then, I spent 1 year on heavy medications in a zombie state, the next year losing all the weight (75 lbs) I had gained, and then was hospitalized again at the end of that year. The weight came back, as did the zombie medications. And thus my recovery cycle restarted again.

Over that time I went on a few exciting vacations, finished my senior year of college, worked a white collar job, and lived in 3 different states. Although I was heavily medicated for 50% of it, the amount of time I spent in a *normal* state of health was &lt; 10%. As a result of this, I can remember very little of my early 20's.

I lost some friends when I was sick.

I made some new ones too.

But everything that has happened feels like a dream. A time distortion, if you will.

The trips to Montana/Wyoming, Costa Rica, FL Keys, North Carolina, and Idaho all seem like they never happened, and at the same time, feel like just yesterday. It's the strangest thing, I feel like I could wake up tomorrow in my bed by the river in Montana or in the sweltering sun down in Florida.

As it relates to school, senior year is a hard thing to watch slip by while heavily medicated and overweight, especially for a social guy. I remember feeling at the time like I was missing out on so much.  And that feeling has only grown with time, as I reflect on the girls I very likely would have dated and the events I never experienced. It's a hard reality when you realize everything you once held close has gone. Especially when it feels like only yesterday.

The memory loss is not complete and sudden, but rather a continual blurring of reality. The underwater feeling of the medication plus the general chaos that is recovery makes for muddled thinking and a poor grasp of the past. It is even worse when others around you realize you're not as sharp as you once were.

It's a sad reality to be living in, and while I'm in an improving state now, it still hurts to look back and realize not only what I missed out on, but also that I cannot remember some of the great things I've had in my life. I wonder if it was worse to be heavily medicated in a great environment - such as college - or be healing in a substandard one. Some days I wish I could go back, others make me happy with where I am now.

My struggle isn't as bad as many of yours, I realize, but I hope you've enjoyed better clarity of mind than I have since my diagnosis. It's been an incredibly difficult time.","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

I take my daily sacraments unerringly, but I'm not doing well, I'm just scraping by. The meds decrease the amplitude of my cycle but I still cycle and I'm white-knuckling it as I wax and wane. 

I've seen number of therapists in the past but always end up extremely annoyed with them because rather than sharing their techniques with me I'm _subjected_ to them which makes me feel as manipulated and out of control as my disease does. (Cf. attached)

Subsequently I alternately walk out of a session or fail to reschedule an appointment. Is it just a matter of finding the ""right one""? Has anyone found self-help books that work?

Many people don't know that bipolar depression is usually just as destructive to your life as ADHD, in the same ways, plus a lot more ( just compare the suicidal rates and major symptom severities between them ). In my case I know it's true, because I was given both - ADHD mom &amp;amp; bipolar dad.

Quick note: I can control my hypomania, and our family does not have addictive personalities. If you are not the same - beware.

I grew up an ADHD kid. Emotional problems became evident in tween years. Suicidal depression began at 17. Depression worsened until it stabilized at ~21 - My life was mostly affected by depression, not ADHD.

Early 20's I kept seeing doc after doc to get help for depression. Counseling didn't work - meds made things worse. 

By 23, I had worked everything from call center to railroad conductor. I was going back to college for the 4th time, and was seeing another counselor ... I had already given up. The counselor believed I had depression caused by ADHD, and gave me Adderall IR to try.  

I flew through the rest of college. I kept jobs for more than a few months. The depression still worsened, but taking Adderall during the day gave me a much needed break for a few hours. It allowed me to keep a job I did not despise ( bye bye Target and farmhand ), and I burned out more slowly. 

Woke up and couldn't get out of bed? Took Adderall - an hour later I was omw to school or work. Those were the days that truly saved me - they affect your life a lot more than you think. 

Without a doubt, Adderall was my life saver.  It's not a permanent solution for bipolar depression, but I still haven't found a drug that is ( currently trying Latuda ).

I'm certain many with BP2 could benefit, even if they ""technically"" don't have ADHD.  But, honestly, what's the difference between ADHD and long-term severe depression? ... besides the fact everyone would pick ADHD, if given a choice.

It does suck coming off the drug at night. It does make it easier to trigger hypomania. But, you know what - the nights were a lot worse before ... lying in bed, thinking about going nowhere, and which fields I had to water in the morning.

I posted here a while back, as my meds gave me crazy panic attacks (Quetiapine). It stripped me from my personality and ability to give a shit about anything. I told my psychiatrist that I will no longer take them.

Just before she prescribed Quetiapine to me, I donated blood at the local blood central. I do that maybe 3 times per year. But this time was the first time I donated during a depressive episode. The nurses asked me if I was alright after they looked at my blood levels. Then they gave me iron supplements (Fe2+ 100mg) to take every morning and evening. 

I had crazy mixed episodes after I stopped taking Quetiapine, but it eventually faded out. 

Now I take 100mg Fe2+ (iron sulfate) every day, and I have never been more stable in my entire life. I feel as if my life has come back and I can operate at 100% like normal people, without dipping and isolating myself from the world.

Here's a screenshot of the last 30 days of my moods. The green line is my sleep pattern and the purple bars are my moods. Usually when my moods dip below ""baseline"", I am knocked out and can't be a useful part of society.

My parents separated around this time when I was a kid, my brother was sent to foster care around this time of year, and I was kicked out of my home around this time of year around my 18th birthday. So I've always had a special level of self-loathing right about now.

And in 2011, it was very nearly rock bottom. I had a job I hated, I had an apartment I hated, I'd just finished destroying my one good relationship in 5 years. I was on a hypomanic that just kept growing, but at the same time, my self-image was cratering. It was probably the closest I'd come to ever taking my own life.

But wwo years ago today, I sat with my sister in an emergency room, talking with a charge nurse about checking into an inpatient mental health facility.

I spent just over a week there, getting my meds figured out, getting my coping skills rebooted, and generally decompressing. I followed it with 6 months of twice weekly therapy and weekly sessions for 6 months after that.

And today? No issues. I'm not hating life, I'm not wishing I was somewhere else, I'm not on edge about a single thing.

I love my job, I live with friends who are nothing but supportive of me, and I'm okay being single right now, for the first time in a long time.

All in all, my sister and I deciding that it was time for me to get checked in was the best decision of my life.

Doctors often don't give out a diagnoses unless you ask for one, and I think that's one of the reasons. They want you focused on getting well rather than searching the internet to define who you are. Only you know who you are, no label can tell you that. 

Another reason is you may have multiple diagnoses and the doctor doesn't want you focused on what that means. Why? Because for the doctor a lot of the diagnoses are just there for coding for insurance companies. The doctor may have a very different view of what they are treating you for other than what's on the DX sheet.  In order to prescribe certain meds they think will help you, they need to add in another DX so insurance companies will pay for it.  A lot of insurance companies won't pay for something off-label for a DX so your doctor just adds on the corresponding DX for the medication their experience tells them will help you.  They can get burned for doing this, so just go with it- especially if the meds are working.

My doc is open about this but many aren't because technically they aren't supposed to do that. So if you have some DX on your sheet that you feel doesn't fit you and your doctor is saying don't worry about it, well then don't worry about it :)","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

I feel like a twisted caricature of myself, or a robot without a soul, or like with taxidermy when an animal is completely hallowed out, that's how I imagine myself, I'm physically present but internally there is just nothing there, like the color black in space.

I try to be stable now because I lost everything from mania, friends, relationships etc. It's fairly difficult for me to have friends or relationships because I dissociate a good amount, like if I get pushed to far I enter this wierd state of mind which is especially not good with anger. I feel practically no emotion, no guilt or remorse and I say extremely cruel things and jokes to people while laughing at the same time, and put people down HARD. Sort of like the joker from batman, I'll go from being really depressed to that really fast when people push me too far or do something that hurts me. And then afterwards when my emotions return I start crying really heavily and experience this heavy almost unbearable wave of guilt because of the things I said and did. I feel like life isn't completely real, and that I don't entirely exist, as if a piece of me is missing and I'm never getting it back. Life sort of feels like a dream to me that I am just floating through my medications are the only things that really keep me going, without them I would probably kill myself. My medications are the only thing that really makes me feel happy, it's almost impossible for me to form emotional connections with other people because I think I have PTSD my last therapist said I did. I push people away because feeling emotional connections with other people gives me a tremendous amount of anxiety and fear, I'm very detached emotionally, so it's actually difficult for me to feel emotion because it's so suppressed. My fears of connection with others are so bad that girls who like me I push away because the emotional connection gives me THAT much anxiety and fear.

I'll attempt to make a summary here and more detailed explanations below. I have been diagnosed with Bipolar and OCD (The doctors say it’s mainly Pure-O, but of course there are some regular OCD tendencies in the mix) about 8 years ago. I always knew something was weird with my thoughts and decision making since I can remember, but could never quite understand it. Many years and lots of unexplained stupid decisions (buying and selling multiple cars/items/moving to a different city on a whim). Suicidal and homicidal thoughts the entire time. In the new city a year later I went to the doctors and was prescribed anti-depressants for the first time (Wellbutrin). Everything was going great until a few weeks later when I made a gigantic ass of myself at work by telling everybody that I was going to start my own company amongst other things. I booked a flight home and called my friend and asked him if he would want to work in my company. He told me that I didn't make any sense and suggested that I go to the hospital as I told him I was recently put on some new medications. I took his advice as we have been friends for over 20 years. During that time period I also made a lot of stupid decisions and spent/gave away thousands of dollars....oh did I mention I made a gigantic ass of myself at work?......one of the most embarrassing moments of my life, but the most recent one was the worst as I sent an email to over 1100 people and made videos and tweeted as I made yet another gigantic ass out of myself...........anyways.....I went to the hospital and was admitted for 1.5 months until they found me fit to go home and put me on more meds. 

So far I have been hospitalized about 9 times and have cumulatively been in the hospital for about 2 years. Since then I have been on countless medications with insane side effects (Mania, I couldn't control my arms (they raised up and I couldn't feel my arms. Had to get a shot to negate the effects), seeing demons at the end of my bed, suicidal thoughts, SJS, couldn’t see, my legs would randomly stop working, throwing up, massive weight gain, massive weight loss, lithium poisoning, etc.). Nothing has worked except for the Wellbutrin during a short time period, before it made me go manic. It was the best thing I have ever experienced, for a week I was the person who I thought I was my entire life. I have tried countless medicines, one-on-one therapies, groups, extended hospital stays, crisis lines, ECT and so on. At this point I have been off work for almost 2 years. 

I think the tipping point was when my best friend from the hospital killed herself on a weekend she went home. A few days before the weekend there were a few signs, but nothing serious. She was the most amazing person I have ever met (gorgeous, intelligent, everything) and most of all - most of all she was the only person that I have EVER been with that I didn't think about killing, and for some reason didn't have any suicidal thoughts when I was with her. She taught me so many things and made me face a lot of my fears. Even though I was extremely depressed at the time, she made it as good as or perhaps even better than the week while the Wellbutrin was working. Everything reminds me of her even when I do everyday tasks. After that my hopes for getting better were crushed as her and I were similar in so many ways. I never knew her diagnosis or what she suffered from because we agreed not to mention it. I still regret making that agreement.

Lately my homicidal and suicidal thoughts have been worse than ever, if there is a scale. I suppose above I didn't even mention any of this though prior to this, but it's pretty much the motivation to die. I never get a break, its 24/7, even in my dreams. I'm pretty sure I would never hurt anyone else and that it's just the thoughts. However, distinguishing between reality and my thoughts is lately harder and harder and I don't want to hurt anyone else other than myself. I used to play computer games to escape and get some relief, but over the last 2 years(ish) I get no relief or enjoyment out of anything. Crying during the day and crying myself to sleep almost on a daily basis.

I WILL NOT BE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL AGAIN! If somehow I am forced to, I will be doing ANYTHING necessary not to go. Being locked in a room for weeks and/or strapped to a bed doesn't help. It just prolongs my life to make others happy that I am still ""fighting"" in my opinion.

**----------TL;DR (before the detailed stuff, because who wants to scroll down a wall of text, well, I guess you kind of just did)----------**

I'm 98% sure that I'm going to kill myself, I've exhausted my options and my level of give a f**k is about 1/100 at this point. I've lost every reason to live and see no possible positive outcome for the remainder of my life. I will be doing a will this week and making a final video for my family and burning it to DVD + upload to YouTube. May 26, 2015 is most likely going to be the day if I can hang on until then because I want it to be the same day (not the month) Chelsea died. I'm not sure why I am posting this here, perhaps just to collect my thoughts for the video sadly. Maybe someone will have some information and I will have an ah-ha moment, but I sincerely doubt it. I am a good and intelligent person, and this illness has just screwed me and everyone that interacts with me. I can't continue to put my family or myself through this emotional rollercoaster anymore. 



The rest........



(Not going to paragraph this, it kind of flows........sort of....plus I'm kind of sick of typing at this point)..........but here is a detailed explanation of things.

**Chelsea ♥:**
On my last forced hospitalization, well not really my last I guess. I entered the building and saw this girl sitting at table. The sun was shining on her hair, sort of looked like she was an angel or something, I dunno. It's very weird for me to think that because I'm not really religious. I was like........wow......maybe I am in the right place after all and this was meant to happen. She is the prettiest girl I've ever seen and I didn't really know why she was in the hospital. I was really nervous and didn't really talk to her for a few days. Then I was like screw it, just talk to her, just say hi or something. Turns out we had a lot in common. Seems like we both had the exact same path and it's really strange. Over the 2 months that I knew her we hung out almost every day for a significant portion of the day. The best memories I have of her are when I had to get home but didn't know how to take public transportation. I was reluctant to do so due to my thoughts of jumping in front of the subway/bus/streetcar. Needless to say I was very anxious about the whole situation. Without hesitation she offered to go with me and comfort me the entire way (I think we only went a few stops just to try it out), but that meant a lot to me that she would help me out like that. We played board games together; we played snakes and ladders but didn't have any pieces. We used a cheerio and a medicine cup, haha. It was epic. Played piano, watered plants, went out for countless coffee's and had amazing conversations together. We both pushed each other to do some things we didn't really want to do. I helped her out with her resume. Physically I hate people touching me, but we did hug a few times. It felt like we were one person.........(I dunno, that’s just what it felt like and I have no reasoning for that). The best memory I have of her was one day I was really down and asked her if she could hold my hand. She did. Something so simple and insignificant to other people, but that meant the world to me. I don't remember everything due to my ECT treatments. But I know the time I spent with her was the best moments of my life. My suicidal and homicidal thoughts were nonexistent when I was with her. It was truly amazing. Prior to her killing herself on one of the weekends we could go home, something was weird and she was a bit sandofish. I had no problem giving her some space. We both sort of had an agreement with each other that we wouldn't tell what our diagnosis was but were free to discuss if we had any issues like I did getting on the public transit. We talked a little bit about things but didn't really get into detail. She didn't come back on the Monday and I was concerned that she left the program. It didn't even cross my mind that she killed herself while she was at home on the weekend. On the Thursday they brought me into the room and told me she killed herself over the weekend. I was devastated to say the least. I was put on a form 1/3 or something like that as my suicidal thoughts were as bad as they have ever been. I couldn't go to her funeral or even go outside. I definitely would have killed myself if they let me go home. I'll never know truly what was going on inside her head prior to her killing herself. I will never forget her and check her Facebook almost every day for some reason. I'm glad she added me, but at the same time I feel that I need to unfriend her. Never going to happen though. I think about her hundreds of times a day as the suicidal thoughts trigger thoughts about her. It's just a vicious cycle.


**Suicidal and Homicidal thoughts + OCD:**
A long time ago when I was a kid the only signs of the OCD I had were the thoughts of hurting other people and counting stairs out loud. My parents thought the stair counting was cute, but it was sooooo annoying to me and I had no clue why I was doing it at the time. Over the years my OCD has developed to something I could have never imagined. It all seemed to start when I was a kid and had a huge asthma attack and my heart stopped for about 4-5 minutes or something like that. I had massive memory loss, couldn't remember how to wash myself amongst many regular everyday tasks. Since then I have had basically constant suicidal thoughts, it was occasionally prior to that event. Every situation triggers my thoughts. Bathing, driving, doing the dishes, talking to other people, watching TV..........ALL THE TIME! It's been overwhelming lately and gotten much worse. If there is a scale. I wipe myself until I bleed every time, counting stairs, having to step on certain tiles in the kitchen, wiping my face with my hand and retching on my lip, sometimes until it bleeds. There are a few other ones that are too embarrassing to share with totally random people, and I'll never tell anyone them. The one medication that did help with some of the physical things was clamipromine. However after getting it to a dosage that was effective, I couldn't see. It was basically like looking through a water bottle. No other medication has helped with these symptoms. Nothing has stopped the suicidal and homicidal thoughts. For example, I was getting lunch and had to walk across the street and see a police officer and a few lawyers scoping out a location of a prior accident scene. I thought to myself, wouldn't it be great if I just had a knife and stabbed that officer in the neck behind his back while he isn't looking. Best thing that would happen is if he shoots me and I die by suicide by cop. Now, I know that it would be wrong and I would never hurt anyone else. I get these thoughts all the time in every situation I'm in. Whether it be walking down the street and wanting to kick a kid in the head, or at the subway station and wanting to push someone in. The only relief I've had is when I was with Chelsea........I have no clue why. It's like I'm in hell!


-----(Might add more notes to these if I have the energy)-----

**School:**
Public and high school were stupid easy and I got honors without trying. Went to multiple colleges for multiple programs and failed some of my courses because I was just thinking of hurting my classmates the entire time, the courses that I didn't fail were really easy for me. Never could study because I was thinking of stupid crap the entire time I attempted to. This occurred in high school and public school as well, but everything was stupid easy.

**Finances:**
I worked when I was young and paid for everything myself (car, college, insurance, etc.). In my episodes I have bought many TV's/gaming consoles/electronics. However the most expensive mistakes I have made was purchase 2 brand new cars ($25,000+ each). I was making enough money at the time to pay them off and currently have my 2nd new car as my current. During my manic episodes I gave away thousands of dollars to homeless. Even have a vlog of me doing it when I was manic, super fun. The steering is messed up now and looks like it will cost $1100+ to fix, and I need new breaks on the front ($300?). I owe $500+ to work for some stupid disability payment crap, they haven't bothered me about it since I sent them the last payment like a year ago. If I wanted to move that's about $500? That pretty much destroys the remainder of my savings which have been dwindling month-by-month. I am on LTD from work and get paid almost enough to cover my expenses. I don't go out of the house or really do anything, so I can't really decrease my expenditures unless I move. I have never gone into debt and don't plan on it.

I’m tired of this world and all of it’s bullshit.  I’m tired of everything.  I’m just tired.  Tired of my kids, tired of my wife, tired of my life.  Tired of school.  Tired of living.  Can’t I please just sleep?  Why the fuck did God have to do this to me?  Why am I cursed to have bipolar? Why me?  Why can’t I just take some medicine and be rid of it?  

Am I manic, or depressed?  I can't tell anymore.  The medicine has been fucking my world up to the point where I can't tell anymore.  At least before I had a blanket of security at least knowing that I was depressed, or manic.  I could tell that if I wanted to kill myself, I was depressed.  If I wanted to stay up all night and do something, I was manic.  Now, I can't tell anymore.   

So, fuck this shit.  I'm going to smoke a cigarette, stare at my damn computer screen and hope it all goes away.

I'm gonna try to make it as short as possible.

I've been dealing with ""depression"" for the past 4 years, but I just started taking medication 4 months ago (Citalopram 20mg, now 30mg). Before that, I was completely ignoring the problem.

I always had moments in my life where I had a huge amount of self-esteem and would do everything I want. 2 years ago, I woke up one day and decided that I wanted to be a dj, so I went out and bought for 1000$ worth of equipement. It lasted a couple weeks and I sold everything after. That's just one example out of many.
When I wasn't in such a high, I was highly depressed (no self-esteem at all, feeling useless, hopeless, no one understands me, suicidal thought even though I would never do it, etc.).

When I started taking medication to treath depression at the beginning of november, I got a HUGE boost within days.
I wasn't the kind of guy who likes to read, but all of a sudden I felt the need to buy as many books as I could.
Result: I had 7 books, a month later, I had almost 90 books.
During that shopping frenzy, I was planning too many projects. More than I can handle. I felt... invincible, and it felt so great. I thought the meds were working perfectly for me, even though I bought for hundreds of dollars worth of books in just a month.

At mid-january, things started to fall again. I stopped reading and I couldn't enjoy even the most simple things. It's been like this since then. We increased my dosage to 30mg at the beginning of february, but nothings has changed.
The last 3 days were horrible. HUGE mood swings during the day.
Today at work, I was feeling really happy and then someone made a constructive comment about my work and it made me switch mood completely. In a matter of seconds, I went from happy to absolutely depressed. I wanted to quit my job, punch everyone, burn my appartement down and then jump off a bridge.

After talking about it with a friend and reading online about bipolar disorder, i'm starting to think that depression might not be the issue afterall.
I've had these mood swings for as long as I can remember.
I just can't take it anymore...
I never really talked about it because when I'm in a ""high"", I feel like everything is OK and that I don't need to talk about it. But then the bad periods keep coming back...

I have an appointment with my doctor on march 26th. It's in a month... I hope i'll make it until I get to see him.
I don't know who I should call, who I should see. I wanna know what the real problem is and fix it so I can FINALLY be REALLY happy!

I'm desperate... I need your opinion, please.
Thanks for reading.","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

So the last times I posted on here I was fighting a manic episode while in a mixed episode.

I'm happy to say that two weeks on an antipsychotic...or either just time itself...brought me back to level.

It also caused me to gain 10 lbs.  A dear friend, trying to help, told me ""The medicine didn't make you gain weight, your eating did.""...Right.  Okay.  Let me rephrase that.

The damn medicine made me constantly hungry where no food could satisfy it and if I didn't eat when I was hungry I'd be sick.

Hows that?

Anyway that's off topic.

Yesterday I was getting dressed for my internship and...my clothes didn't fit.  I'm already self-conscious about my weight because I AM overweight and guys...I've been trying to lose weight.  I've been trying to stick to this diet that I was on a few years ago that actually helped me lose weight.  I've been doing yoga every morning and building up to the cardio..I can only do a little at a time.  

And those damn clothes.

The clothes didn't start this...depression?  I hate even calling it depression, I want to call it senioritis because..I'm not sad.  I just don't give a...damn.  

When the doctor put me on the antipsychotic he upped my antidepressant and told me that he understood that I didn't want a different one, but if this one wasn't working that I would have to.

I want to will this medicine to work.

But especially since yesterday I just...I feel like a fat little blob that has absolutely no will power to do anything.

I didn't even GO to my internship today.  I called in 'sick.'

I stopped taking the antipsychotic, with doctor's...half..permission.  He told me to cut it in half and if in a week I didn't feel better to stop.  He didn't understand how shitty that medicine made me feel.  It wasn't just the weight gain..I felt drugged, all the time.  I couldn't think straight, was lethargic..which didn't help with the losing weight.

At this point I'm not exactly sure what to do.  I see my doctor again next Thursday.  I have to be better by then.

And this *pokes fat belly*  THIS has to go.  I don't know how besides diet and exercise..I don't know what else to do or what I'm doing wrong or if it was because of the antipsychotic.  I'm to the point though where I'm almost willing to do anything to make it go away..and that's not good.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Mostly because for no apparent reason, after 8 years of being on them, they all of a sudden started having weird side effects. I would get really high from taking them and be happy and then crash and be super depressed. I couldn't take it anymore. I haven't seen a psychiatrist in years and had just been having my gp perscribe me the same meds i've been on with some slight adjustments, but I no longer even live in the same city as him anymore and didn't feel it was safe to continue doing that. 
Up until recently I've been pretty stable. But over the last two weeks I have had a major manic episode and alienated all my close friends (whom I also live with) and then plunged into a deep depression. I have been looking for a new psychiatrist and have found a few that are ideal in my area that accept my insurance. I called 5 of them. Two of whom told me that they were not accepting patients, and the other three didn't even bother to call me back. What the fuck kind of doctor, especially a psychiatrist, doesn't call someone back? Obviously the people calling them need help. 
So, in conclusion, can someone please give me some advice on where to find a competent psychiatrist that will actually return phone calls? Or even better, recommend a good one in the Seattle area? Before I go crazy...",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

They caused me to do things like get arrested.

I went for an emergency Neuro appointment (note immediate availability for patients) and was told by the same NP that she couldn't do anything for me. I needed a Psychiatrist.  

I call a place in bryant woods, williamsville, ny. They hand me over to a Nurse Practionioner. This one spends 20min talking to me and determines that I had BiPolar disorder and needed MORE citalipram (the drug that makes me get arrested) and 30mg of Seroquel. NO INSTRUCTIONS on how to take this medicine were given except 30mg at bedtime for sleep. I wigggggged out on this stuff. I felt like there were bugs constantly crawling UNDER my skin. Very creepy,  monster anxiety,  hell in a pill. Nope. Not doing this.

I go back and this woman NP gives me 5mg of Abilify.  It does nothing. I wait 2 months paying $30 a scrpt (as well as MS meds..meds are not cheap) and still nothing. She saw me once and never increased the dosage even when I asked her. 

I decided that this lady wasn't getting it. 

I went back to the office to ask for a new doctor and not a nurse practitioner because I have both MS and bipolar disorder with ADHD.  I need a doctor who understands neurology a bit more than most psychiatrists do.  Apparently the office policy prevents doctors from being required to hand over a patient's file to an in-house doctor (and one with a background in neuropathy), but the wicked NP from the East Amherst refused to do so. Not only that, she didn't get back to me for at least a month about it, leaving me with no doctor or treatment.
 
So I went on a search for my doctor again. I started back at my Neuros with an in-house Neuropsychologist. He was brilliant.  He administered tests and measured my cognitive abilities. He gave me physical vital examination. He asked about my nutrition and exercize habits. He addressed more of the actual physiology involved than the Psychiatrist. This blows my mind because psychologists are Phd and cannot prescribe medicine whereas psychiatrists are MD and can prescribe medication; yet, the psychiatrist never even weighed me nor took vitals and the psychologist conducted a slew of tests to determine the cause, severity and type of bipolar I had. Irony, right?  The psychiatrist (NP) didn't even provide counseling!   

I went through 3 other doctors before I found one that actually works with other MS patients. I was very encouraged, he wanted to work with my neurologist and make sure that the medicine would also help me with my MS. He suggested Lamictal. However, he wouldn't prescribe it until he heard from my neurologist. My neurologist is a research scientist who just had the rug pulled out from under her research and is trying to formulate a new study. She wasn't able to get back to him right away, and he still wouldn't give me any treatment except for Xanax and adderall. No mood stabilizers, and no antidepressants. 

I went along with him for a few months, until I found out that he was a 76 year old man who took 5 years of the year vacation. He's allocated his patient load to a nurse practitioner. Who already has a full case load as well as Dr. Boca Ratan's, and *see below, keeps limited hours and provides literally no off-hours access for emergencies.  Greeeat.

On our first visit, she was so late and I had to leave so I get my daughter off of the bus thus not leaving her standing in temperatures of 5ºF.  I never even met her that day and left the office without being treated. I needed my Adderal and Xanex that Dr. Vacation had me started on as a patch treatment while we await almighty word from neurology. I had to suffer withdrawal.  MS does not mix with withdrawal.  

During our second and most recent visit I was very prepared with what I needed to know about what I needed in terms of treatment. I decided that the lamictal was too volatile and it's side effects of long term use including cognitive impairment, (which is and is also a disability suffered from MS), I didn't want to get cog fog from two different sources. Instead, I asked for Wellbutrin and additional Xanax to help stabilize both ends of the bipolar just until Dr. Florida returned in April when we decide to pick a more permanent mood stabilizer. 

Things get a little too 'real' sometimes and I most recently have much more dangerous depression than mania.  I needed something to keep me alive until I saw another shrink (April).  Even after her vocalize about how my depression was indeed a severe case, this nurse practitioner person refused to give me any kind of antidepressant treatment because she was afraid that's my normal doctor who was vacationing in Florida wouldn't approve. 

She then decides to take me off of the .5mg xanex (which I could stretch with Valerian root) and replaced that with .5 milligrams of Klonopin. The Klonopin has less of a half-life than xanex and doesn't work with Valerian root at all. So instead of giving me a better dosage of xanex, she gives me this stuff, which doesn't last nearly as long but I'm only allowed the same amount.  I'm being under medicated even more so now. 

I also indicated that the 20 milligrams of adderall that had been prescribed to me was insufficient as well. Because I have MS, I have a special kind of fatigue called lassitude. before I started the Adderall regimen, I could not get out of bed in the morning. I also suffered from intense fatigue all day long and had regular bouts of insomnia that completely destroyed my sleep wake cycle. The Adderall helped in getting me up in awake in the morning, for most mornings anyway, but some mornings where is specially difficult because of extra activity the day before. I would take an adderall at 7am and then sleep until 11 a.m. I knew that I needed more of a dosage in order for this to work the way that it needed to work. I also found myself not being able to focus the way that I was hoping I would be able to with the Adderall as I am also diagnosed with ADHD. This is a great medicine for me but it doesn't go the distance because I'm still pretty scattered. I need a higher dosage. Again the nurse practitioner was afraid to increase the dosage without the consults of the Dr. Florida. 

These people think I can wait around forever for the proper treatment where really it is like playing Russian roulette. 

Needing to be my own advocate (because none of these doctors,nurse practitioners nor counselors seem to be stepping up to the plate), I called my primary care physician and told him I wanted to quit smoking and that I needed Wellbutrin. 

I actually had a visit with him and we discussed my psychiatry appointment and my disappointment in the new corse of medicine that this nurse practitioner who just met me decided that I needed to take. And he agreed with me that especially with Klonopin; it was an absolutely ridiculous dosage. although he agreed to give me the antidepressant under the guise of quitting smoking, which I intend to do, he said that I should call the psychiatrist office back and try to straighten out this benzo problem. I'm sure he assumed that they would get right to work on correcting the error of their way, however nurse practitioner woman only works until noon on Fridays and doesn't come back until Tuesday.*see 'overloaded with patients, above.

I call NP. 12noon, she went home for the weekend. Swell. She told me to call her back if there were issues.  That's what I did. She is unavailable. 

Was referred to counselor. 

Counselor woman refuses to call her on any private number telling me she has no way to call her which I know is complete bullhockey. These people want to leave me an a lurch until Tuesday and in no way shape or form can I get in touch with any of my doctor's all weekend long. I ask my counselor what I'm supposed to do if I have a crisis situation and I need them. She said to call crisis prevention center or go to the emergency room and get into the psych ward. 

So now I have 5 days where I am supposed to be under-medicated. I could probably get the drug that I need on the black market and be okay. I don't want to have to go to the black market to get the prescription drugs that should be provided by my doctor...but if push comes to shove in this becomes a life or death situation, I do what I have to do.

now my regular doctor understands that I'm having a difficult time getting these psychiatrist office workers on the right page with me, so he told me if they are uncooperative that I could take the recommended dosage of the Klonopin which is .5 milligrams up to 5/day, instead of just once a day, and if I were to run out and they were to refuse me anymore, that he would write me a prescription for the Xanax. Thank God I have at least 1 doctor who is looking out for me.

I have an appointment with the neurologist in less than a month. We will be exploring new medicinal therapies for treating MS, but I will also be talking about this bipolar issue and the need for mood stabilizers. I'm going to ask her about lithium because it seems to me that there may be some beneficial effects concerning the damage done in my brain by the MS. I have also been in contact with her office and had asked to be referred to a psychiatrist that is a close personal friend of hers so that I can get a doctor who understands neurology, who can communicate with my neurologist on a regular basis so I'm not waiting for months for treatment, and someone who's not going to be off the map for half the year in a speciality that is changing literally by the day.

I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder retroactively in May of 2011. I still do not have mood stabilizers this day. Hopefully, after getting another psychiatrist, and after speaking to the neurologist, I will finally be able to start some sort of long term treatment.  Its been nearly two years since diagnosis. Lord knows how long I've actually had this thing. Cognitive testing indicates that this bipolar thing was not caused by MS, it was indeed independent of that. That's how lucky I am.

My neurological and emotional problems are enough. I don't need doctors, nurse practitioners or counselors playing with my brain chemistry without really knowing what is going, how to treat it or how to prescribe certain medicines, and causing me what is certainly more harm than good. 

I find this to be extremely dangerous in very irresponsible on the part of these particular professional and there needs to be some damage control at some point here. 

They seem to be more interested in me as a potential addict rather than treat my illnesses effectively.  Bad medicine.  

Anyone else have issues with being 'messed with' by psych doctors?

Spins my head even more!

I was put on another that I cannot recall now but it didn't resolve the issue of not being able to ejaculate on the 2nd medication and it didn't help so I took myself off of it.  


Dumb thing to do I know, but by the time I lost my insurance by the time I decided to get back on it.  I since have gotten good insurance again and have just gotten medication again.  A completely new medication.


The thing is I fear taking it again.  I don't know why but I am just afraid to.  Worst case I have to try a new one.  Wondering if anyone else has this issue.  It seems so trivial to worry about taking something that will only improve me and at the worst I'll have to try something else.  The medication that I have been given is Quetiapine which is generic for Seroquel.  Has anyone taken this before?  Thoughts?",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I'm feeling full of anxious, irritated energy and I'm snapping into full blown rage at the drop of a hat. Rage is extremely destructive, I've punched holes in the wall, I jammed a fork in a wall outlet because I was fucking livid, I smashed someone's car window in with a hammer for parking on the wrong side of an alley way because it made it extremely difficult to maneuver my car in between the two. I felt fucking lit up, grabbed a hammer out of the garage and just bashed it in, felt so fucking good I couldn't help but laugh. I've started having sleep paralysis a few times a week and I just lay there and hallucinate. I've also been having some mild auditory hallucinations at night. Nothing that hasn't happened before, but it's usually not this consistent. I started having rolling nightmares that are so realistic and violent and vivid, I'm in first person and I rarely dream in first person. I'm just stabbing people over and over and I can her the knife plunging and I can smell the blood, and every time I freak out after and think that I can't go on and I have to kill myself in my dream. I've been waking up shaking and sweating and just bawling my eyes out every night for almost two weeks. I feel like I'm just jacked. I started tapering down to 50mg earlier this week because after a week in hulk mode, I just couldn't take it anymore. I'm seeing my psych tomorrow, and I know I need to tell her that this medication isn't gonna fly with me. It's been two weeks of me feeling like I'm about to lose my nerve almost every second of every day. It's impacting everything in a negative way. I've been shitty towards everybody and I'm just combative and angry. My mom knows what's going on, but it's hard when I'm just raging out over everything for almost two weeks. I haven't gone to class since Tuesday morning because I just sat there for an hour thinking, ""Don't freak out, don't yell, don't scream, don't punch or kick or hit anything. Don't freak out just don't fucking freak out."" It's exhausting. College is killing me right now and it's a me problem. 
I still feel fucking jacked, even though I'm taking less lamictal. I don't know if it just set something off in me and I need to let it work it's way out of my system or what. 
I'm not sure how to put all this together for my doctor. She's had me 302'd in the past and I'm afraid she might think I'm out of fucking control. I feel out of control, like I just flip a switch and I'm in angry mode. How should I approach this with her? I think I should suggest a med change. And I'm kind of reluctant to bring up the hallucinations...

THE GOOD:
Last week I was en pointe when it came to my self care. I was doing mindful stretching every day (that's what I call westernized yoga), logging my mood using this pretty snazzy (heh) app for the iPhone that I like (iMoodJournal), and I was doing a good job at staying positive/checking my thoughts. I wasn't manic or hypomanic. In fact, it was the first time I was able to identify what contentment feels like for me and in my body. 

Life wasn't going super well for me either. I desperately need a job and have no idea how I'm going to pay for rent, food, or any of my bills, but I stayed positive and worked to get a lot of applications in and interviews scheduled. I'm still working on this.

I even stopped shaming myself for having Bipolar. I decided I'm a superhero basically - not in the new agey don't take your meds sort of superhero. Every power comes with a price and a need to learn how to manipulate it yourself and not the other way around. I can go without sleep and still function extremely well for example. This comes at a price though, and being able to deal with said price takes well-established coping skills (which I don't have if I'm going to be honest).

THE BAD:
Saturday night I was assaulted by a drunk ""friend"" after I turned down multiple sexual advances. So he eventually tried to beat me up, and while he failed I guess, I'm still in a lot of pain. I got really depressed (for me, and probably not anywhere near as depressed as many of you get). My friend/sort-of-girlfriend/it's-complicated tried to comfort me and be there for me for the next day and the day after. On Monday I was doing okay sort of. I had a lot of exams, so I was focused on that. Yesterday was different though. She picked me up from school, and I was so irritable. I was ranting to her about everything non-stop. (This is a side effect of my Wellbutrin which I am not accustom to and struggle with frequently now. My doctor cut my dosage in half, and I'm still yelling at strangers.) I could see I was upsetting her, so I offered to leave but then felt dramatic so wasn't sure and back and forth and back and forth. She started expressing that she was upset with me, and I just checked out, not on purpose. It got exhausting to stand, so I sat on the floor to avoid falling. I became catatonic, sitting cross-legged into a deep forward fold that I normally am not flexible enough to do. I couldn't speak. Well, I could but I couldn't muster the energy to speak loudly enough to be audible. 

I asked her to come over tonight. I was embarrassed and hoped to make things right but didn't know how. She said she couldn't, that she psychologically couldn't deal with it right now, that she sucks up my depression when she's near me. She means well, but I fell apart anyway. I often feel like I'm constantly apologizing for Bipolar-related behaviors. I recognize that my actions are my actions, and I take ownership of them. It's just that I feel like I'm incapable of being good to people because of that. That added with an abusive family that repeatedly referred to me as a monster/told me that the people who get to know me are the people who realize that I'm not a good person quickly became a recipe for disaster in my mind. I said a lot of stupid things about how all I do is hurt people, how I don't want to be around human beings anymore, how I just want to do the right thing, and how I am just going to leave her be from now on. I told her I'd finally follow through with something (i.e. not talking to her again). 

I clearly want to talk to her again. I love her very much. My feelings still stand though. I feel like if I do talk to her again, then the things I said tonight are suddenly invalid, which in turn makes me feel like my future feelings will be cast aside as dramatic. 



I'm not really asking for advice I don't think. I just don't have any friends outside of her to whom I can talk about this. It's also the middle of the night. Part of me wants to feel better and part of me wants to feel like shit as weird as that may sound. I think I mostly feel like shit, because I'm extremely isolated and just pushed away one of the few people who cares about me. I can only say sorry without changing so many times, and I do try to get better. I really do. I just also feel like I'm making no progress despite weekly counseling and medication.","['nsubj', 'conj']",1,neu_vader

I spent the middle third of my life pondering whether everyone was this fucked up and just hid it better or there is really something wrong with me. I spent the last nine years learning that not only am I diagnose-ably mentally ill, but even for my diagnosis of bipolar 1 I'm unusual.

The standard meds don't work for long, if at all. I've tried almost all of them in various combinations. ECT (electro-convulsive therapy) has a 90% success rate and 14 treatments didn't help me at all. I'm lucky to have seen the same psychiatrist this whole time and he refuses to give up. Last winter he referred me to a published research biopsychiatrist for a second opinion. This guy claims to have at least two ""miracles"" a week where he finds successful treatment for someone ""treatment resistant"" and he's baffled.

I think about suicide often, but I care too much about traumatizing my nieces (4) and nephews (2) to follow through with anything, most of the time. I'm consumed with self loathing and I'd love nothing more than to get a break from being with me, but I am me, so that's not really possible, legally. I spend all my waking hours just trying to distract myself from my head and when my attention span is fickle it's even harder. Luckily I'm going back on Strattera, which does seem to serve its purpose, at least. I've been on intermittent FMLA since my ECT last September/October and last month I went on full time FMLA and started short term disability paperwork because the only way I could tolerate staying at work was self injury. I didn't work a full pay period in months.

I'm stupid-lucky that my parents are involved and willing to fill in the financial gaps while helping me figure out how to just tolerate living. They'd rather have less money and me alive, is what it boils down to. The rest of my family wants to help, I think, but I'm not sure if any of them quite get the extent of the despair I tolerate. My sister-in-law has jumped on me more than once about my negative disposition, disregarding that I never say anything disparaging around the kids, who adore me, for whatever mysterious reason. It's all that ever runs through my head. I'm supposed to keep all that silently inside? I can't handle it.

TL;DR: Turns out I'm the bad kind of ""special"". None of the standard treatments work for me and my case profile confuses multiple experienced psychiatrists, so when people are looking for reassurance in others' experiences I keep mine to myself.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Lately paranoia has been getting worse.  It started getting illogical about five years ago.  Thinking the police are after me, the FBI is after me, the IRS is after me, the NSA is after me.  I went on a weeklong trip out of country and kept thinking that the country I was staying in would find some way to detain me and deport me for some reason.  I'd have trumped-up charges, disgrace everyone I know, remain in jail for years, despite not doing anything wrong.

The thoughts aren't rational.  Example: yesterday I went to a local show, kept feeling like there was somebody watching me from behind.  When there was an extra long delay between sets I kept thinking it was because the police were coming to arrest me.  Sometimes my mind races and I try to figure it out.  My thoughts often turn to numbers/geometry, trying to discern patterns in them (prime numbers used to ""hide"" things, obsessing over certain numbers, etc).  Sometimes I am afraid of people I know, like they will hurt or poison me.  I can ""reason"" against this but it still makes me uneasy.

I am generally good at suppressing this and have not told anyone about this.  I have a reputation for being paranoid among my friends though.

I don't know if this is going to get worse.  I had an abusive upbringing, fought to escape, and have been on many, many psych meds for depression/anxiety/bipolar.  The meds have never done much and were extremely expensive so when I lost my job I stopped taking them.  I didn't notice much change in how I felt.  I constantly have nightmares.

I want to move out of country eventually.  I have been scouted for work multiple times which requires security clearances but stopped discussions after realizing that they would need access to my psych records.  I don't know how any of that can happen if I am falling apart or have a history of paranoia like this.  I have fought so damned hard to not think about it but I don't know if it's getting worse and I think it is and everyone treats what they see of my anxiety as a personal failing that I need to ""get over"".  I often, often, often think of suicide, obssess over it, so that I do not have to deal with any of this anymore.  It feels like the only way to fix my head.  I don't understand why I had to go through hell growing up and then have my brain falling apart further.  (I will not commit suicide until I extinguish all options and I still have things to try.  I'm not mentioning it here as in ""I am planning to do this soon"", rather as in ""I have had these thoughts for a long time"".)

I have been to at least seven or eight therapists over the years, and at least five psychiatrists.  My family beat the shit out of me so I don't have that to fall back on.  I have had doctors abuse me in the past and am terrified of them.  I don't feel I have a backup other than myself.  

The best part of me is my brain, the part that works.  I hate the rest of my body.  In the past I starved myself and cut myself but stopped largely because I wanted to nourish my brain.  I cannot reconcile that medication to calm me might dull my brain/wreck my memory.  The idea of it makes me feel even more broken.  I was recommended ECT many years ago but did not because I did not want to lose mental function.

I have tried many medications (abilify, zoloft, prazosin, lexapro, alprazoram, effexor, remeron, trazodone, paxil, among others), vitamin supplements, exercised to the point where I was very in shape, meditation, and other things.  I am losing faith in doctors to help fix me.

This is difficult to write.  Apologies in advance if it were hard to follow.

If you've been in the same situation let me know if you have any advice.  I don't know if this will get worse.  I am in my 30s now.  I badly want to ""get over this"" but I don't know how.

And that makes me ask myself if I've really hit my full level of crazy, or if this is just a preview. That leads into asking myself what I'd do if I got worse, what would happen. I mean, what if everyone can handle this mild version, but if I do go full bat, I'm not sure anyone would stay. I don't know. I don't even know who I am anymore. I can never tell if something is a symptom, or me. I never know what's the bipolar's creation and what's really me? Right now I hate myself and I don't know what to do about it.

I will stop taking my lamictal for a day and I will feel so allive, i just love that feeling.. like llife is good, music, the weather, people and just everything. Then of course I always end up crashing. 

Playing around with your lamictal dose will send you to HELL. I remember the only times i felt good when I was on ssri's was when I would stop taking it for a bit, but i never felt the horrible effects that I did with lamictal.

I am supposedly bipolar 2. I was abusing alcohol and adderall a lot, so I am not sure if that lifestyle just caused me to be like that. I also got manic on ssri's. Many medications make me manic.

I had looked up Bipolar I and II before. I noticed the similarities between Bipolar II and my own personal experiences. I even brought it to attention to my best friend that I might be bipolar II, but nothing was diagnosed.

I was still waiting to meet with a psychiatrist after my last episode. I was experiencing an intense and devastating bout of depression that lasted several months. I felt like I was dragging invisible heavy cargo on the ground behind me. No one could see it slowing me down, but the weight was real even to the point where I was catatonic on the couch for weeks.

Unfortunately for me and other people who have this particular mental illness, your road of recovery isn’t clearly one way or the other. Each day is full of sever mood changes. I would have temporary moments of clarity, joy even. A time when I thought I was capable of anything. This would last for about an hour or two at the most.

Maybe it was when I took my dog to the beach, as I took each step I felt stronger, happier and more capable; only to arrive home, filled with dread and hopelessness. Each Hyper-manic episode seemed like a white hot light, an escape and freedom from the darkness only to come face to face with the cold hard reality that it was a lie.

I’m no wife, I’m not a good person, I add nothing to society… I am nothing. Quickly the thoughts of suicide radiated my mind like an electrical charge that both thrilled and devastated me. Weak, tormented and empty it’s no wonder I hadn't showered or brushed my hair. I went to the doctor’s the day before my 26th birthday and begged for help. 

I couldn't live like this anymore, one way or another something had to change. This ‘thing’ wasn't just effecting me, my family was suffering and enduring  seemingly infinite cycling ups and inevitable plummeting depths of this debilitating depression. 

Fast forward to three months later. November was an anxious time. The medication my family doctor prescribed dulled the depression, but added an intense dose of panic and insomnia. This was a small price to pay, consider I’d have to wait three months before seeing a professional.

My Psychiatrist, reminded me of Mr.Miyagi from the Karate Kid. He was quick in speech and blunt. After a complex explanation of previous episodes, a trips to the mental ward and my family history he was sure of my condition.

He leaned over, and confidently shared his prognosis,  ”I’m 90% sure you dealing with Bipolar II, based on your history of depression and radical behavior. I’m surprised you weren't diagnosed sooner. Although I can see the reasoning behind the last psychiatrist thinking your were suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.” His response didn't shock me, I was amazed.

I remember just sitting back in my chair and contemplating the recent research I had already done. He handed me a questionnaire to be filled out for the following week to confirm his suspicions and my first session was complete.

I went home and cried. I was relieved, I  agreed with the diagnosis and I was petrified.

""I’m Bipolar, so now what?""

She has been in a depressive episode for months now and it seems like she is just now starting to get out of it. She is currently working with her doctor regarding treatment, she has been on all sorts of meds over the past year and we still haven't nailed down the right combo. So its been quite the rollercoaster over the past year. Her doctor recently put her on Haldol (Sp?) and it seems to be working for her so far (fingers crossed!)

Lately, I have been trying to help her get back into the groove of things but there are a few touchy subjects that I don't know how to bring up. She rarely showers, I don't know how to tell her that its common practice to shower more than once a week. Also, she never brushes her teeth, and I don't know how to get her to brush her teeth. I try to set an example and im in the bathroom brushing my teeth before we leave the house every day, but she doesn't catch on. Also, I have no idea how to get her to wear clean clothes. I use to do her laundry for her but it got to be a bit much for me to handle (I still don't understand how one woman can have so many clothes). So she said she would start to do her own laundry, but she doesn't. She just picks dirty clothes out of the dirty laundry pile and continues to wear them. I'm just not sure how to bring these things up, or if I even should. 

I do my best to encourage basic hygiene. I always throw in some of her clothes in with mine when doing laundry so she has some clean clothes, and occasionally I will draw her a bubble bath and tell her to have a relaxing bath whenever she is having a very rough day. I just don't how to get the idea of basic hygiene through to her, or perhaps she knows all of this, but just doesn't care how she looks. (which in that case, maybe the meds aren't working as well as she lets on). 

I don't know. Over the past year I have done what I can to be understanding of her illness. I have read books on bipolar disorder, I have talked with psychiatrists, I have reached out to her family and mine for help over the year. Her illness is very hard on both of us. More so on her, I can't even imagine the battle she fights everyday, but its also very difficult on me. Ultimately, I want to help her get back to a sense of normalcy. She wants to get to a point where she can be a functioning member of society again (her words).

I just want to know how to help her with this. I don't know how to bring up these hygiene issues to someone who's current mental state is as fragile as it is. Or should I just let it go for now and see how the Haldol works in the long run as shes only been on it for about 2 weeks so far.  

sorry for the wall of text, any insight would be great. Being in a relationship with someone with bipolar I is extremely difficult at times, but if you truly love that person, then you adapt, and you do what you can to help that person that you love. I have been taking care of her for the past year, and I've ended up learning much more about myself in the process. She is truly a blessing to me, and I just want to know how I can best help her.

   New to the Subreddit.  I was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder two years ago and I'm still having a tough time with my medicine.  I was just curious though, has anyone else noticed that when you are having normal days, you're REALLY good at socializing with people?  It's weird.  I've had countless people tell me at work that I'm really good with people and I articulate well.  I'm a total social butterfly when i'm at work (assuming meds are working), but when I have a downswing, it's horrible.  I can't even be around people without being anxious or depressed. 

For those that are curious, here's my medicine regime:

I'm finding that I have much more energy now and never require daily naps as I did previously, though my nightly sleep is still normal (8-10 hours a night).  I also seem to be retaining information better as well.

I personally know some people who have taken Seroquel with great success and with little to no increase in need for sleep.  However, I was sleepy the entire time I was on it.  Is this normal?

Also, now that I am on Lithium (I am also taking Paxil 20 mg, Vistaril 50 mg as needed), I find that I have significantly more energy.  I can stay up all day, do more, remember more, and physically have more energy so that I am able to run more and take more walks.

Is this due to the switch from Seroquel to Lithium?  I was wondering a few days ago if I was hypomanic, but I have no ""abnormal"" urges as I normally would.

I don't really expect anyone to read this. I am more so doing this for my own personal benefit. Most of the time when my brain is foggy and there are just too many thoughts floating around, I found that writing it out helps. If you do happen to read this, and wish to comment on it, you're more than welcome. I can get quite lengthy when I write though, just putting a warning out there.

I struggled with depression somewhat in high school. I never had a lot of confidence in myself and never felt that I was really good at anything, except art. Art has always been my one thing that I can take pride in, I love it, and it's my safe place. I would go sit in the art room and talk with the art teacher during my lunch and we were very good friends. She would let me do extra side projects and I was pretty much in that room every chance I got during my senior year. Don't get me wrong, I had friends. But I was also very much an introvert and was not your usual high school kid that went out to parties or even hung out outside of school with friends. Which there is nothing wrong with, that's just who I was. I started blossoming more towards the end of my senior year and getting to know more people, being more social. But then we all graduated and mostly nobody talks to anyone anymore. I moved a couple times and I really enjoyed the freshness of being in a new town and not knowing anyone. It was a chance to have a new start and better myself for the people I would know in that area. Anyways, I'm getting really sidetracked here. 

So, depression in high school. My parents sent me to therapy which seemed to help me a good bit. I think I gained a little more confidence afterwards and that's what helped me ""blossom"" toward the end of my senior year. I lived with my parents another year after I graduated as I was trying to figure out where I wanted to go to school, what I wanted to do. I was probably the most social I've ever been during that year, and I felt good. Occasionally I would get these random heart palpitations and I felt like I was going to die, so my parents took me to a doctor, who sent me to a specialist, who then put me on a heart monitor for month, to conclude that ""there was nothing wrong with my heart and that they didn't know what was wrong with me. See ya later!"" Now I know that these were just anxiety attacks, as I still deal with them on a regular basis. 

A year after graduating, I move in with my sister and her family who reside in another state. I wanted to move out, get a new start, and go to school. Then I found out I had to live there a year to get in state tuition, so I got a job and began the one year wait. In that time, my depression started seeping back in my life. It was worse this time, a lot worse. I couldn't figure out why I was struggling so much, because really I had a lot to look forward to. Not only was I taking a couple steps into adulthood, but I had also met an amazing guy who after a month of dating I just knew that he and I were meant to be and he felt the same about me as well. Granted, he lived three hours away from me and long distance relationships are very difficult, but that's a whole story in itself of how that happened. I did blame some of my depression on missing him and hating the distance that separated us. We would Skype every night, text nonstop throughout the day, and try to see each other at least every week, but a lot of times that wasn't possible. Sometimes though, nothing would be bothering me in particular and then I could feel it coming. It's like I was slipping down a very steep hill and trying to claw my way back up, but there was no way to stop it. I could feel it coming and when it did, it was crippling. I can't tell you how many times I sat on the bathroom floor and sobbed uncontrollably while trying not to hyperventilate and just wondering why I was feeling this way and how in the world to I get this to stop. 

I started talking to my dad more because he was really the only person that understood what I was saying. Most of the time I would struggle to even put into words how I felt, but when I would talk to my dad he would put the words into my mouth for me and I would exclaim, ""YES! Yes! That's exactly how I'm feeling!!"" It was such a relief in a way, that someone actually understood what I was feeling and could put it into words for me. That's when I started doing a little more research on bipolar disorder and began wondering if this was maybe the cause of my troubles. 

So, I moved again. This time it was to my boyfriend's town. After six months of long distance, I decided enough was enough, I couldn't handle it anymore. So, he agreed that I could stay with him until I got a job and got my own place. Everything seemed perfect and I was so glad to finally be with him everyday. I literally cannot express the joy it gave me. 

Fast forward a couple months. I had no luck in finding a job, and after doing some math I began to wonder if I could even afford my own place if I did get a job. And let me tell you, going from long distance relationship to living with each other, is stressful as it gets. Lots of arguing and tension in the house, along with crying and feeling at my absolute worst. However, through it all my boyfriend was very loving and caring. He has seen me at my worst and often would stay up with me in the early hours of the morning trying to console me and my uncontrollable crying. He's the best guy I've ever met, and I am truly very lucky that I am with him. But, not only was I having severe depression issues, but these thoughts that I just could not get out of my head. Racing, awful, terrible thoughts that I so desperately just wanted to GO AWAY, but as loud as I would scream that in my mind they would just continue. After an incident that I am not comfortable even typing out, my boyfriend finally sat me down and convinced me that I need to get help. Honestly, I don't know why I hadn't done it or even thought of it sooner. I began looking up psychologists and low and behold there was one right across the street from us. I began going every week and I started doing a lot better. My episodes were more manageable and I felt pretty good. I went to a regular doctor and they put me on thyroid medicine. I have been tested about 5 times or so for thyroid disorders because I am always tired and my hair just falls out in clumps, but it would always come back negative. Well, this doctor decided to experiment and thought maybe my depression had something to do with my thyroid too, so we gave it a shot. And, I felt really good! My hair stopped falling out and my emotions were so much better! My psych was very excited and I was as well because we thought we had figured it out, so eventually I stopped going. Which, it did seem like that was the solution to the problem, because I missed a couple doses one time, and I was a fucking mess. Like, exploding into a sobbing mess in the middle of Wal-mart for no reason at all. Yeah. So my boyfriend and I concluded, just stay on my thyroid meds and I'll be okay; he always made sure I never missed a dose again. Another main reason I quit therapy, was I finally started school and got extremely busy. Which busy is good for me, and my therapist even told me that. Sometimes I would get a little down in the dumps for no reason, but most of the time my mind was preoccupied with school, work, and trying to find time to spend with the boyfriend. But then when summer started, which was last May, I started just not feeling right again. I call my mom and talk to her about once a week and she even noticed it. She pointed out that I told her I was not feeling myself, or I was feeling down more times than I would actually be happy. Happy...I didn't even know what that word was anymore. I knew that I should have been, but I wasn't and that made me even more sad. Except for those random days where I would get this burst of energy out of nowhere and I just felt so on top of the world and that I could do anything I wanted. ""Why can't I feel like this all the time?"" I would ask myself. ""This is awesome!"" But in the back of my mind I knew what was next. It always happened that way... After feeling so awesome and wonderfully happy, I'd hit rock bottom. Like a roller coaster; once you go up to the very tippy top, you have to come down to the bottom. My mom and rest of my family urged me to go talk to my doctor about being put on bipolar disorder. And I did, and she put me on Lamictal after I told her about my dad and that's what he takes. 

I've been on it for about two months now. When I look back, I feel like the last three years of my life or so have been so wasted. Even before my medicine when I thought I was happy and doing well, I now see that I was depressed constantly and some days were just a little better than others. I am so amazed. I am so happy and never thought I could ever feel this good. Mostly everyone I know has noticed a difference. One of the biggest changes aside from not feeling depressed anymore, is my socialization. I'm still not a fan of large groups of people, but talking to people I don't know that well or hanging out with a group is now fun. It's easy and I don't cower in the corner and stay silent the whole time. I approach people and talk with them and make actual conversation. Even my doctor noticed a difference in that. She said before I would sit on the exam table hunched over and speak very softly to her without much emotion. Now, she said my posture is better, I look more alert, and and I'm over all just more radiant and full of life. Talk about a difference! I am so thankful for medication and how it is changing my life for the better. 

On that note, I found that I still have a couple manic episodes here and there. And they seem to be a little more...evident or noticeable. I talk so much and so fast and say things that are personal and make me cringe when I think about how I was acting. It's like I'm drunk. Anything can come out and I don't care. Even after the episode is over, it's almost as if my memory of it is fuzzy or hard to remember some details, just like when you're drunk. But it has only happened a couple times so far, and honestly I'm not really worried about it because I feel so good the rest of the time. That being said, on yet another note, for the last week or so I have been feeling a little down. It's not nearly as terrible as before, not even comparable. My anxiety has been higher and I haven't been able to sleep to well, but overall I feel pretty good. I mean, I know this medicine isn't a cure all and I'm probably still going to have a few down times here and there. I feel like I am coming out of it today, so I'm glad for that. 

The real reason I came here to write before I wrote my entire life story was something that has been bothering me and intruding my thoughts quite frequently since yesterday. My immune system sucks. I get sick a lot, but not nearly as often as I used to in high school. I missed a few days of work last month because I had a cold and then lost my voice completely for a few days, thus I couldn't talk to customers. So yesterday I was hesitant to call off when my stomach had been churning and forcing me to visit the bathroom frequently for the last 24 hours. I just feel guilty for calling off, even if I'm really sick and being that I had called off recently for a few days that made my guilt even worse. Yesterday I was still feeling pretty down and work was the last place I wanted to be but I told myself I needed to go. But when my stomach was still bothering me three hours before my shift, I started to debate whether to call off or not. As I said, I was going back and forth because I really wanted to, but I also felt guilty about it. My stomach persisted so I made the phone call. Now, the store asks that you call 2 hours in advance and I called at 1:50 when my shift was at 3:45. So, I was 5 minutes late, and I didn't think it would be that big of a deal. Well, I was on hold for ten minutes or so. When I spoke to my manager and told her I thought I either had a stomach bug or food poisoning, she abruptly cut me off and asked what time I was supposed to be there that day. I told her 3:45 and she told me that I didn't give her a two hour notice. I told her that I called pretty close to 1:45 and she abruptly told me that still wasn't a two hour notice to which I was confused and simply said, ""Okay?"" I'm still confused about it...I mean, correct me if I'm wrong but 1:45 is two hours before 3:45, right? Anyways, then she proceeded to tell me that I had not been on hold ""for no 17 minutes"" because it was 2:03 then. So, truthfully I had been on hold for about 10-11 minutes which is still a long time in my book. I didn't know what to say, so I just told her ""okay"" again and she told me to feel better and hung up. 

So, I can't stop repeating the conversation in my head over and over. I cannot stand it for people to be upset with me, I've always been that way. It just eats away at me. I already felt guilty for being sick and calling off, and now I just feel ten times worse. I'm off until Friday, and I honestly just want to never go back. This has kind of been a habit for me though. I've been through a lot of jobs. I need this job though because there are no other current opportunities and I'm literally living from paycheck to paycheck. I'm not sure if I'm going to get in trouble or not, but I'm really hoping the whole thing blows over and she doesn't even mention it again. Until Friday, I will just be sitting here anxiously awaiting work, playing the conversation in my head over and over. 

What gets me is...how do you have a job when you deal with stuff like this? I'm going to school to be a comic book artist/writer/illustrator which will be perfect for me because it involves me, myself, and I, along with my creative skills. No people, no bosses. I don't have to worry about calling in sick or missing too many days. Not to mention this is really what I want to do, aka my dream job. But in the meantime while I'm still in school, how am I supposed to handle these crappy minimum wage jobs that have such strict attendance policies and rules. I mean, how in the world do you call your employer and say, ""Hey, I can't come in today. My social anxiety levels are through the roof and it's just one of those days where talking to people is a no go. I really just need to have some me time and get through this funk and sadness but then I should be good to go in a couple days."" How do you explain a mental illness to your employer? You can't. 

I desperately just want to quit this job and start painting and selling those online. Or maybe get an online job of some sort although I don't know much about that. Or maybe do both. Anything that would allow me to support myself, by myself. ","['nsubj', 'pobj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

I haven't tried any harder drugs, but that's probably just because they aren't available in my social circles. 

I am terrified of having kids because I am afraid I won't feel anything for them. The only people I truly think I feel for is my husband and my mom, even then .... I don't know if what I feel is love or gratitude for dealing with me ....

I have never been abused. I have the worlds most supportive family and husband. I just want to feel some ""high"" or pleasure other than my mania that's basically ""I must get everything done right now because I am the most bitchin woman ever created!""

It all culminated this weekend into hysterical crying fits that last all day and emotional, raging outbursts. I've alienated people who have been nothing but supportive (especially this one person, but they're a special case. More on that later), been sent home early from my job, spent an hour sobbing in my car, and basically just been through an emotional hell, all within the past 48 hours. 

I don't want to alienate anyone anymore while I'm like this. I feel like I'm liable to mess up over and over again. I'm a university student working 5 classes in a major that I'm not going to pursue (I've been in school for 5 years and still don't have a bachelor's degree, and I'm switching majors AGAIN. I feel like such an absolute failure), so completely shutting myself off is not an option. I have, however, stopped talking to people and deactivated my Facebook. I hate feeling alone, but I know that if I don't, I'll just blow up again, at least until these meds take over (just started Lamictal and it hasn't reached therapeutic levels yet). There's also a special reason why I've been feeling this way for months now.

So, that special person? Well, it's a woman (let's call her Jill). I met Jill at the beginning of the school year last fall. We just had that instant connection, you know? We were so similar and had such a good time together, that everything just clicked. In hindsight, I was on a pretty long (almost 3 months) manic high from the past summer. I didn't care though, I was in love. Jill was so... perfect. If you had me describe my ideal woman, it would have been her to a ""t"". 

I had just been dumped by my fiancee that March, so life was finally starting to look up... Until I slipped. I had moved to a new city, transferred to a new workplace (same job, different location) while I was in school, took on a 15 credit hour course load, and gotten involved with the Student Government Association. Yea, I had my plate full... fuller than I have ever had. I just thought I could take on the world, ya know?

Anywho, I started to slip in classes. Like, I just wasn't getting it. I felt so... retarded. I'm 24 years old! These 200-level classes should be child's play! Plus, my manic high had reached the exhausting point where I couldn't stop my thoughts. Most of my thoughts revolved around ""Oh my god, you're not worthy of this girl"" or ""You better not screw this shit up, Deathnerd!"". So when I started to slip, I lashed out. Not a violent lashing out, but emotional, self-abusing lashing out. Worst of all, I lashed out to Jill. I had only been dating her for almost 3 weeks, but I felt like I could trust her, ya know? I guess it scared her. Her whole demeanor changed. She didn't look at me with that sparkle in her eyes anymore (that damn look... I'd kill to have that again). Instead, it was replaced with what could best be described as apprehension, a little bit of fear, pain, and disappointment. In her eyes, I was an infallible monument of confidence that just... crumbled away to reveal a scared little boy.

She left me a week after that. Hell, while we were dating, she even told me she liked other people. I just brushed it off though, thinking I could hold on to her and wow her socks off, ya know? She told me she wanted to remain friends though, and by the look in her eyes I could see that she really meant it. The next day I started getting pictures on my Facebook feed... Pictures of her and some guy... and she had that sparkle in her eyes; the one she used to have when she looked at me. Goddammit...

That sent me into my spiral. I tried not contacting her, but my mind seems obsessed. It's almost as if she's a drug, and I can't function correctly without her. Damn me and my big heart. No, damn me and growing another heart just for her.

So, I stopped talking to her last semester, and tried to collect myself. No avail. I finally caved in and started talking to her towards the end of November (she dumped me at the end of September). It was rough, but it took me till the beginning to January to get to where I could talk to her like a normal person (while still harboring feelings). 

We started hanging out when the semester started and things were going swell. I found out that the guy she left me for was emotionally abusive to her and he cheated on her with his ex. That left her pretty scarred. I was there for her when it happened though, and tried to help her through it. Things went along smoothly... until we started hitting the bars and clubs. Jill is one of those girls that gets really flirty and touchy-feely when drunk. She'd make-out with guys at the bar and give them that look with sparkles in her eyes... and it killed me to watch that. She'd leave me in the middle of the bar to go flirt with other guys (which I shouldn't have any problem with because I'm just a friend). Still, it was so hard to watch her get constantly swept off her feet, just like I wanted to do.

After a particular heavy night of drinking, I drove her home. I had only one drink the entire night, but she was plenty plastered. When I dropped her off, she thanked me for being so amazingly supportive and there for her while she got over her ex. She then said, with that loving look in her eyes, that she loved me, and proceeded to kiss me pretty passionately. I told her the feeling was mutual. 

I tried not to think about it much because of how pleasantly drunk she was, but it kept nagging at me for a few days. So, to end the confusion, I asked her outright what she meant by it. She got almost defensive and said ""I meant as a friend, Deathnerd"". This was over text, so I'm just guessing on the defensive part, but when she uses my name it's always to add emotional emphasis. Anyways, I slipped by telling her that I loved her more than that. Apologies were said; emotions were run through, but we came out with no hard feelings... or so I thought.

One night we were at a club. She was dancing with the bassist of the band that was playing that had invited her and me. I could tell right away that he was interested in her, and she was interested in him too (those damn eyes again). He proceeded to sweep her off her feet and all I could do was sit there and watch. She didn't even let me take her home; she stayed with them and let him take her home.

That night I slipped; I told her how I felt. I told her that I felt so bad that I couldn't be the guy she wanted, that I couldn't sweep her off her feet, that it pained me to watch her get taken away by guys like that. I immediately regretted it. She responded the next day saying that she felt like a bitch. I apologized and took the blame for not keeping my emotions in check. Hell she's even told me that she JUST wants to be friends, and nothing more.

Fast forward to recently and I can tell she's falling seriously head over heels for another guy. She laughs and smiles when he texts her, and her eyes light up. She'll never tell me, but I know when she's out on a date because she doesn't respond to my texts. Anywho, it all culminated Saturday night. I sent a text (I posted it and the accompanying feelings [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/188fgp/just_crumbled_under_the_weight_of_my_depression/)) that snapped me into thinking about what I was doing. I succeeded in apologizing to her and setting it right, though she was absolutely livid at me (mostly because I couldn't leave her alone and kept sending apology texts. My mind just doesn't know when to stop).

So, I've decided to stop all communication with her till I can get over my depression. I don't think I'll ever change the way I feel for her though, which makes it worse because she's been so supportive of me over the past month. She's gotten me out of my comfort zone and trying new things like being social and dancing. I get the feeling that she genuinely cares, but that I'm far too attached and unstable. I also deactivated my Facebook because I can't even bear to see her name in my chat box. 

Am I doing the right thing? Should I continue being friends with someone I love romantically, but they don't feel the same (she's told me it weighs on her conscience)? Should I shelter myself like this till I get better and properly medicated? I just honestly don't know anymore, Reddit. I come here because none of my friends know what I'm going through enough to give any solid advice. I know I probably should cut her out of my life, but it would be like cutting out my own heart. 

Sorry for the long post. When a heart like mine has so many holes, it's hard to keep everything in.

I am starting to feel like it was really wrong of my psychiatrist to give me a year supply of valium.

I am cautious about taking them and really only do if I'm having a panic attack or flying BUT what's bothering me is that he knows I was hospitalized for being suicidal and the reason I had gone in to get my meds adjusted (which was when I was given the valium) was because I had started cutting and feeling suicidal again. recently I have been a pretty dark place and can't help but consider taking the whole bottle. I dont think I will but the fact that its available to me is now puzzling me. How can you give a person with suicidal tendencies something that can be overdosed on?

and now its making me question my diagnosis because I'm not trusting him.

He's perfectly nice, but I have a hard time connecting with him, and he doesn't make eye contact with me (I'm not sure if he has a medical condition or what). I even mentioned seeing a new psychiatrist to him before I lost my last insurance carrier, so he knows I'm not totally satisfied with him.

I would find a new psychiatrist now that I DO have insurance, but it would be quite costly as my new insurance will not cover pre-existing conditions (like my mental health issues) until May of this year, so seeing him is $80 per visit, which is about standard for other doctors in my area.

I really think I have Bipolar II, but I don't want to totally self-diagnose. It just seems like it would make a lot of sense regarding my previous behavior and how treatment-resistant my depression is. I'm not demanding he change his mind, I just want to open him up to that possibility, but I'm not sure how to phrase it. I don't want him to think I'm so shallow that I read one Wikipedia article on Bipolar II and was swayed by that alone. It doesn't help that while I always have great rapport with therapists, I was told by a different psychiatrist once that ""we're running out of options here"" for medication, which made me feel utterly hopeless. While I think medication is an absolutely crucial part of treatment for depression and anxiety for many patients, I think psychiatrists themselves can be hasty and incomplete in their diagnoses and prescriptions.

I can feel my symptoms getting worse despite the constant increase in medication.

I would kill myself, but I have incredibly low self-worth and would rather live in misery than upset my friends and family. Oddly enough, I have high self esteem, probably due to exercise and a healthy diet.

I'm trying to file for disability, but that is the only real light at the end of my tunnel. I live in the country, miles from a city/town, at a family friend's vacant house, surrounded by memories and momento's that aren't mine.

Last night I didn't go to sleep until after 6am. I tried relaxation exercises, concentrating on my breathing, counting, focusing on things in my room..nothing seemed to work.  Tonight I'm feeling..different.  I'm tired.  I'm so tired, but sleep just won't come.  I've been laying down for about two hours, and I know that's not good for you, but I keep hoping if I keep laying here I will go to sleep.

I have Ambien I can take, but I don't have many and I'm honestly scared of getting addicted to them and not being able to sleep without them.  What if that's what's going on here, that I can't sleep without it.  I try to tell myself it's not so bad because I don't have anything to do but class on Thursdays. I took everything else off my plate this semester because of my bipolar.

Anyway, not really sure why I'm posting this except hoping that somehow getting it out will make me sleep.  Does anyone else ever feel this way?  Do you think it could be the change in meds?  Could it be the lack of Ambien?  Or could it just be a phase.  I don't know.  What do you think?

Edit: Update: So I fell asleep around..4 or so, do really remember what time. I had taken an ambien and I went to that song and made it play on loop.  When I actually fell asleep...I slept clean to 2pm.  I won't lie, I don't like sleeping that late, and I feel rundown today as a result, but man it felt good to actually sleep.  Planning on trying that song thing again tonight, that was awesome.  Thank you for that.","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

I am 41, my BP wife is 43, we have an 8yo daughter and a 13yo daughter.  I am telling you know that I am rambling here because I am just lost and do not know what to do.

I am at a crossroads with my wife and her sleeping.  I understand that her medication makes her tired and that she sometimes needs extra sleep but it has gotten to the point of affecting our families lives.

Her typical weekday involves her (sometimes) waking up at 7am to help get the girls ready for school.   I get up as well to get ready for work.  I drive my 8yo to school at 7:30 and my 13yo leaves for the bus at 8am.  As soon as the girls are gone she goes back to bed and does not wake up until our 8yo gets home from school at 2:30pm.  What kills me is that she ""goes to bed"" around 10pm each night but she sits in bed playing the phone games until 2am in the morning.

 Once she is awake she hardly does any house work at all and sits around and plays games on her phone.  She typically has 20-30 words with friends games going and if she is not playing that she is playing Candy Crush nonstop.  So much so that she installed the game on my phone and my daughters phone so that she can lay theme next to her phone and do something where she gets ""lives"" for the game.  I have had to take over cooking dinner because if I do not do it she will feed the kids something out of a box/can in the early afternoon so that by the time I get home they are not hungry and so no dinner is made.  She meanwhile will make an entire cookie sheet of Pillsbury chocolate chip cookies and that will be her breakfast/dinner.  Either that or she is eating Pop Tarts or Peanut M&amp;M's.  I decided at the beginning of this year that I would take over shopping for groceries and I would cook. We have a very tight budget on everything, including food, cause she does not work.  When she was in charge of buying groceries she would always run out of money but never had anything to show for it. 

I am at the point where I am not comfortable in my own house because it is always a mess.  I am not talking about just some clutter, I am talking about dirty, filthy type of mess.  I have pictures but I am reluctant to post them.   She wears the same pajamas and sweat suit all the time so she never really has an issue with her clothes but the girls and I are constantly running out of socks, underwear, dress clothes for school and work.  I try to go to the laundry room to do laundry myself and I can hardly walk around or even figure out what is going on in that room because it is such a wreck and there is mountains of laundry.  her deal with laundry is she just keeps buying the kids more clothes instead of washing them, maybe that is where the grocery money is going.

I have tried and tried and tried to talk to her about creating a schedule for cleaning and how she should readjust her sleeping schedule where she actually goes to sleep earlier and gets up earlier.  She gets very angry at me anytime I suggest changes to her existing schedule.

The above issues have affected our family deeply.  When I do come home from work that is when my wife tries to do some housework, but when she finally does housework it is because she let it go for so long we are eating cereal out of muffin pans and we cant sit anywhere in the living room because trash is everywhere.  So once she decides to do housework she wants me to suddenly jump up and be helping with everything after I have been at work for ten hours or more.  I want to spend time with my family at night, play UNO or other games with my girls, and spend time with the family.  I want to sit at the dinner table and have a family dinner.  If I try and do any of that then suddenly I am lazy and do not help.  And trust me, I do plenty.  Her back is always ""hurting or sore"" so she cant do anything that involves lifting, carrying or bending over. UGH!!!  I am so frustrated just writing all this. 

The thing that was finally the last straw was the fact that she finds time to always run errands with her sister and help her sister with stuff all the time.  Then, we had a friend that had major brain surgery last week and all of a sudden she is volunteering to go over to their house and clean and be there during the day while the husband is at work to take care of her during recovery but she wont even help her own family.


I just do not know how to get through to her.  I tried over and over and over to talk to her but I just do not get anywhere.

Thanks for letting me vent.  Hopefully somebody has some words of wisdom.

i'm just curious, but how did no one not one doctor realize it was the antidepressants causing my ""psychosis"" why on earth would i grow up randomly to be schizophrenic? i mean, its gone now and has not come back, i feel like a new, as new as whatever that means person. schizo runs in the fam, but still!! cmon. that's a great uncle.

i'm curious as to what people here would think. 24 yr old male here, curious, because honestly, i just don't get it, i'm the one that figured it out, and as i recount things i thought and experienced THEN to my current therapist, he's telling me that's what was going on. all i get is ""well that's strange, but those meds effect everyone differently""

seroiusly not one doctor. i did try to get off them sometimes but i couldn't do it because the withdrawls were so bad, and i thought they were helping me, didn't care (got off celexa finally last April).


yeah, guess what it fucking did to me? i was the fucking guy from Fight Club! 

worse, i don't know how long its been going on, because the way i feel now, is like still so new, but i know this is reality, obviously now everything i uttered then was insane. i mean, years. longer than six. is that even possible? don't schizo people have like an ""eye of the storm"" where the psychosis goes away for a little bit? then again, i wasn't schizo.

is it because of how new they are? they DID drive me insane! horrifyingly enough, i did NOT know i was insane.

I live in a completely dysfunctional and toxic environment.

For now, my SO and I are stuck living with my family until we can pay off some debt and save up for a deposit and a couple of month's rent for an apartment. We're currently students and I'm unemployed, for various reasons (can't trust my family *at all* with my dog, bipolar me isn't job friendly).

Since I've moved back in (May), every single one of them, my mother included, have targeted me and told me what an awful and useless person I am. I get one or two of these ""attacks"" every month. For 5 months.

They don't take me seriously, they don't consider my opinions, and they see me as subhuman. If I express any emotion at all, it's ""Oh, it's the bipolar."" Doesn't matter the emotion or occasion.

So I'm angry and depressed all the damn time. I don't even know if medication can change that. Every visit, my pdoc asks how I've been, and every month I tell her I'm stuck in a shitty situation, so she ups my dose.

I want disability. I want disability so bad. I need something that will help me get back on my feet while I'm still working through my meds and seeing a therapist. I'm told it takes a lot of work. I don't care. It'll be like a job I'm being paid for.

But I don't qualify for disability because I'm a student. But if I stop going to school and I don't get disability or my grace period ends, I'm worse off than I was before.

So there's all kinds of fucked up things happening in my life right now.

That all sucked but no suicide thoughts or super awful reckless behavior (I always thought it was just young kid in the city having fun kind of stuff)-- aka it was all manageable for the most part.

I was on lamotrigine years ago, 150mg once daily after titrating, and while it helped reduce my episodes it seemed to lower my baseline and rob me of my motivation so we paired it with buproprion (Wellbutrin) and that was a pretty successful mix. I'm not sure why it's different this time, except maybe the fact that when I started the first time I was in the middle of being depressed, and when I started this time I was in the middle of being hypomanic. Maybe I'm still *very* mildly hypo, but without the characteristic negative symptoms? Or maybe I'm just hesitant to accept that I'm just in a legitimate good mood from actually being able to get so much done - because I'm so used to good moods coming with a host of problems. My one gripe is my appetite - it normally fluctuates with mood, and it's stuck on manic eat-everything-all-the-time mode. I thought lamotrigine is supposed to be weight-neutral, but unless it also speeds up my metabolism or something I can't see how I'll avoid gaining some weight.

Bipolar disorder, a chronic, relapsing brain disorder, usually develops in the late teens or early adult years, with half of all cases starting before age 25. Patients with bipolar disorder often have extremes of mania and depression that alternate with periods of normal mood. During manic episodes, behavioral changes such as restlessness, insomnia, irritability, risk-taking, or thoughtless behavior will occur. During the depressive phase, patients often become lethargic, lose interest in activities they previously enjoyed, and are at risk for suicidal behavior.[1]

Psychiatric symptoms have been associated with low cholesterol and include anxiety, depression, euphoria, irritability, aggression, and suicidal ideation.[2] A link between cholesterol and mood disorders has been investigated.

Cholesterol is abundant in the brain and is important in many aspects of cellular structure and function. Cholesterol affects the fluidity of cell membranes, membrane permeability, exchange processes, and may influence serotonergic function.[3] Cholesterol depletion may impair function of 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors and serotonin receptor activity.[2,3] Over time, lower cholesterol levels may further decrease expression of serotonin receptors and cause a reduction in serotonergic activity. A correlation between low levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in cerebrospinal fluid and cholesterol has been shown in suicide attempters.[4]

More than 30 studies have linked low cholesterol with suicidal behavior.[5] Other studies have shown a possible link between low cholesterol levels and increased number of suicides, suicide attempts, and self-injurious behavior; these findings have not been consistently replicated, particularly in the Asian population.[4] Overall evidence does not support routinely using cholesterol levels in assessing suicide risk. In addition, research linking low cholesterol with suicide may be confounded by depressed mood leading to lower serum cholesterol as a result of poor nutrition.[2]

Compared with controls, patients with bipolar disorder (mania and mixed syndromes) had significantly lower total serum cholesterol.[6,7] Patients with bipolar and major depressive disorders had lower cholesterol levels in the brain compared with healthy controls.[8] In one study, patients with bipolar disorder in remission had lower cholesterol concentrations compared with controls.[9]

Other studies have shown an increased prevalence of hyperlipidemia, primarily in the form of hypertriglyceridemia.[2] Treatment of mania appeared to reduce cholesterol in one study[6] but increase it in another.[10] A cohort trial in 131 participants examined the relationship between fasting total cholesterol and subsequent depressive and manic symptoms.[11] Among bipolar patients (n=65), low cholesterol predicted a higher proportion of follow-up weeks with manic but not depressive symptoms.

Following the hypothesis that lower cholesterol levels may be associated with mood disorders, it is reasonable to ask if cholesterol-lowering medications are associated with increased depression and suicidal ideation. A review of the literature[12] found many case reports of adverse psychiatric effects associated with the use of statins, fibrates, and ezetimibe. A meta-analysis of large clinical trials of lipid-lowering agents did not show an association between use of these medications and rates of suicide.[5]

Statin medications with low lipophilicity (eg, pravastatin) are less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore may be less likely to cause cognitive or psychiatric adverse effects. The University of California, San Diego Statin Study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing outcomes pertaining to cognition, behavior, and quality of life in patients prescribed pravastatin 40 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, or placebo.[13] This ongoing study will, we hope, clarify the noncardiac effects of statins, particularly the effects of low or lowered cholesterol on cognitive function, aggression, and serotonin biochemistry.

To further complicate analysis of the role of cholesterol in bipolar disorder, epidemiologic studies show that the rate of metabolic syndrome in patients with bipolar disorder is increased relative to the general population.[14] This is seen internationally and is associated with more complex illness, less favorable response to treatment, and poor outcomes.[14] One study found that bipolar patients who met criteria for metabolic syndrome were more likely to report a lifetime history of suicide attempts.[15] The association between metabolic syndrome and bipolar disorder is mediated by both iatrogenic and noniatrogenic factors.[14,15]

Patients with bipolar disorder should be screened for risk factors for metabolic syndrome before treatment. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are commonly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and are associated with causing or worsening metabolic syndrome. Therefore, healthcare professionals should perform the following in patients with bipolar disorder requiring SGAs[16]:

Obtain body mass index, personal/family history, waist circumference at baseline;

Obtain fasting plasma glucose, fasting lipid panel, and blood pressure at baseline;

Reassess weight change at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after initiation or change in antipsychotic therapy and quarterly thereafter; and

Reassess fasting plasma glucose, lipids, and blood pressure at 3 months and annually thereafter or more often in those with a higher baseline risk for diabetes or hypertension.

The literature supports a relationship between cholesterol levels and affective symptoms in patients with mood disorders, including bipolar disorder. However, the findings are inconsistent and suggest that the relationship between mood, cholesterol levels, and neurotransmitter function is very complex. Lower cholesterol levels are associated with increased risk for suicide and future manic symptomatology. However, bipolar patients are also at risk for metabolic abnormalities including obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, which affect clinical presentation, course, and response to treatment. Patients should be carefully monitored during treatment because many medications used to treat bipolar disorder can worsen metabolic abnormalities. More studies are needed to clearly identify the correlation of cholesterol levels with mood, risk for suicide, and the biochemistry of serotonin.

So, for the longest time I thought that the mania that was triggered by the copious amounts of antidepressants shoved down my throat was the meds working. I'd be happy? for about a week than crash and burn. 

&amp;nbsp;


High school sucked, I couldn't get out of bed. Truancy officers loved me. Graduated by the skin of my teeth and did one semester in college before finding that coke binges and alcohol was far more fulfilling than school. This went on for a couple of years before my mothers narcissistic guilt trips finally helped to 'turn me around' and go see a psychiatrist. 

&amp;nbsp;


When I tell you my mother is narcissistic I'm not exaggerating. After stressing about where I was and why I wasn't in school, my dad confronted me in the most 'dad' way possible. Angry and concerned, and a little bit of crying. I told him I'd much rather be dead and had wanted to be for as long as i could remember. I went straight to the psychiatrist. My mother decided that she needed to go to the same one, because 'her problems were much more 'pressing"". 

&amp;nbsp;

I told the truth, bawled like a child and told the doc that my mother was a severe hoarder, would spend thousands on things we didn't need and make my little sister and I eat whatever canned food was left in the pantry. We weren't a poor family. Dad had an incredible overseas job that paid well, at the sacrifice of being home a total of 2 months out of the year. So dad never saw the verbal abuse towards me, constantly, ""lose 20 pounds and you'll be pretty"" ""lazy"" ""no one is every going to love you looking like that"". I was Homecoming Queen my Junior year. I picked out my own dress, did my hair and makeup, and felt pretty for the first time in my life. Bitch had the nerve to tell me, ""you know, you're okay, but you'll never stop a room, right?"" Ended up crying my makeup off and leaving right after the ceremony to get shit tanked. Like I said, I told the doc everything.

&amp;nbsp;

But mom had seen her first. The doc went on a rampage about how pathological lying can be hurtful 'not only to me, but to the ones I love'. Time to mention my mother is bipolar as well. But the doc gave her a clean bill of health. I wasn't the liar, and mom knew it. But her smug face when I walked out of that office was the final twist of the knife.

&amp;nbsp;

I left. I lived on my friends couch for a year, but made sure to keep in touch with my dad. I love my dad, so much, and he loves me too. I think this is my moms excuse for acting out against me, 'he loves her more than me'. Dad found a lovely new psychiatrist and therapist for me. If you can see a pattern, things did not go as planned. I had tried about every antidepressant and nothing was working, so, in my mind, offing my self was the way to go. I was a financial burden on the only person I loved. O.D.ed. Shitty way to try to go out. Nausea, pain, and my kidneys let me know I was an idiot. 2 weeks in the hospital and I had learned a lesson; not a great one, but at least I wasn't gonna try that again. 

&amp;nbsp;

19. Had dropped my shitty friends and found new ones. Found a guy who loved me. Funnily enough, I loved him back. Now, I can't tell for sure if it was the mania that made me decide to move in with him within 2 days of our mutual epiphany (probably), but 3 years later and I'm sure its the best decision I made. We moved 1500 miles away from mother. One problem down.

&amp;nbsp;

He was incredibly supportive and worried when he found out I was turning my arms and stomach into sliced sausage. He hid all his hunting knives and bandaged me up good and didn't scold me. This was new. 'I don't understand, but on some level, I know it feels good to you. You tell me you feel numb all the time, and maybe that makes you feel nice? I don't know, you ain't gotta explain it. When I'm at work, text me if you feel like doing it again."" That worked. It wasn't the end of the world to him, he could tell that I wasn't happy, or really anything, so he just stood by and helped me when I needed it. He's not my white knight and never will be; he's my partner. My pal. So when I calmly explained to him that I was never going to get better after a round of Brintellix and Clonezapam, and that I would really love to blow my head off, he found me a rehab center.

&amp;nbsp;

'The Ridge' was okay. I got to talk to my appointed doctor after only 2 days of being in there. After only a few minutes of talking to her, she says 'you don't have 6 problems, Anny, you have 1.' I was elated to at least know what my demon was; why nothing I tried before had worked. Bipolar 2/schizoaffective. I was all smiles and determination coming out of there a month later. 

%nbsp;

Its been about 4 months since I got out of there, and am currently trying out a mix of Quetipine and Oxcarbazipine. This is my third try for the right combo. I recently slept through my 22nd birthday and am trying to stay in the mindset that it all takes time. Depressed as fuck right now, but I see my outside doctor again on the 26^th.

Please don't be offended by what I have to say. I'm being completely honest with how I feel, but I'd like to change the way I think. I'd like to be able to sympathize with my father at least.

I've never been close to him and I hardly even know him. I rarely interact with him because I guess I inherently am scared of him. I have vague memories of when I was little and his mood would suddenly change. I always thought he was just kidding around, but it got so annoying. I only found out when I got into high school what bipolar actually meant. On the other hand, my father also may be schizophrenic. I also have memories from when I was little that he would see things or hear things, and then talk to them, which was how he ended up being diagnosed as bipolar. 

In daily life, I avoid him. I don't ever know what to say, because to be honest, my father is not the most intelligent person in our household. He's very simple and most of the time, I find him irrational. When someone interrupts him or angers him, he stutters.

I don't believe all of these are symptoms of being bipolar, but of it and something else. The thing is, when he was an infant, he had a high fever. The doctor gave him medicine, but the medicine caused some kind of brain damage from what I understand.

So here's my question, what is a more understanding way of approaching bipolar disorder? How can I better understand his situation (from a bipolar perspective)? I want to treat him like I would anyone else, but I feel like I should be more sensitive and patient with him. At the same time, I feel like my patience will dry up and I'll only build more resentment.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

The way bipolar hit me, I clung to the things closest to me - relationships, hobbies, qualities of myself and others - and slowly they were all turned into addictions and compulsions. As believing in something turned into fighting for something turned into fighting for anything. Bipolar disorder cost me 2 relationships, a point off my GPA, 3 hobbies, and more friendships than I've kept track of. 

I hoped the medication would bring back ""me."" What it gave me is perspective. I saw that I was not a prophet, or a latent telepath, or a savant genius. And now I can see that all of my attributes were perverted into something else. And now, everything's gone. All of the hate, violence, confidence, everything that I was seems to be gone. And I'm glad it is, but it's hard to start over as a person.

I look at the people around me. It's amazing how other people go day to day thinking that ""friendzoning"" or a bad grade are their biggest problems. What I hate most is seeing couples and realizing that I used to be just like them, and it brings back everything I've lost.

I think I have friends again. I can work again. But I can't shake the feeling that I'm missing a piece that I have no idea how to begin to get back. This is the best, most stable I've felt in years, but it feels like emerging from smoke and fog to see a a desolate city where there used to be a prosperous one.

I am in the middle of a depressive phase (2 months) and I can't see the future right now. Every day I wake up with a feeling in my chest and stomach like I've lost someone I loved or got my heart broken. I feel worthless and hopeless and don't want to leave bed. When I do finally get up I think about how empty my life has become (no social interaction or achievements) and feel powerless to change anything. I can't remember a time where I've ever been well, only slightly depressed, stoned, or manic and that makes me think that I'm never going to get any better despite my psychiatrists attempt to medicate me into normalcy. Recently, I've been having lots of suicidal ideation, I think things like ""I just can't take this anymore"" and images of jumping off a building or hanging myself enter my mind as a solution even though I don't act on them or take them seriously. I'm afraid of dying, but don't want to live like this.. if that makes sense to anyone. 

I feel hopeless mostly because of the events in my past that ended in failure and discontent. Repeated attempts at college were interrupted by manic and depressive episodes that prevented me from completing my courses. I actually do not know whether or not I have ADD or I'm just too lazy to pay attention and study. I would start out with enthusiasm that I was finally going to get my life together, but when it came time to do the work I became totally uninterested and overwhelmed. I just didn't want to do it and couldn't force myself to push through the drudgery every single day. I would try to fix this by smoking marijuana to make things more interesting and calm myself down, but this only distracted me further from what I was doing and created memory problems that led to failed tests and eventually more total apathy toward anything but getting high.

I would become a trainwreck and end up in the hospital either for telling people I didn't want to live anymore or becoming so detached from reality that I thought I would be able to start a company based on one of my crazy ideas. This is always a recurring theme in my manic episodes. I feel omniscient, like I have this amazing plan and its going to make me rich, but to others it seems like total nonsense. The worst part of this is that I get excited and want to tell everyone about it, and they have no idea how to respond to me because I'm totally insane.  My Mom and Dad then try to bring me back into reality by showing me the flaws in my plans, but I just get angry at them for trying to ""crush my dreams"". We get into arguments that stem from them trying to control me because they're worried about me and I respond to that by lashing out and rebelling against everything they say.The last hospitalization I had, which lasted an entire month started with ""falling in love"" with a girl I had just met, getting angry at her for not spending enough time with me, and then when she dumped me, taking my tuition assistance money for the semester (I had stopped attending classes) and using it to go on a wild vacation with one of the guys I bought my pot from. This was a total disaster that I don't even want to describe in detail because 1) its hard for me to remember exactly how the events transpired and 2) the more I think about how delusional I was, the more I get caught in a spiral of self-loathing. Long story short, I ran first to a friends place in Pennsylvania (I live in New York) then drove to surprise visit my sister in Maryland on a whim, booked a suite that I couldn't actually afford and then called my mother promising that I had the money I just couldn't access it. Then, ruined my car because I thought something was wrong with it and attempted to fix it myself, abandoned the drug dealer in Pennsylvania after an altercation over paying an Uber driver...and when I finally got back home, took a bunch of MDMA and ended up feeling like I was connected with a superior being, that I was the smartest person in the world for coming to this conclusion, and that my father was actually God for creating me. I confronted him with this epiphany and he responded by putting me directly into the looney bin, and the entire time I was there, I was convinced that I didn't need to be and the medication they were prescribing was going to ruin my mind and take away all the creativity and brilliance that I was currently experiencing.
Thinking back to these things now only makes me feel disgraced and embarrassed that I ever reached such a point of psychosis. At the same time, I wish I had the feeling I had when I was in that state, like anything was possible and the future was going to be filled with excitement and joy, that the world was an amazing place to be and that there would be countless other women who would love me and respect me. Now I believe the exact opposite of all of those things, and don't understand how I ever believed such nonsense. 

I see a psychologist who keeps telling me I need ""movement"" something to keep my mind occupied until the feelings go away. He recommends a job over and over again. I'm unemployed and live with my Dad. The thing about working is that I don't feel like I can handle the responsibility of showing up somewhere reliably and performing a task without getting bored and upset that I have to do something I don't like. It's definitely an immature perspective because most people will say that work isn't fun... but I literally feel like I'm either going to fail at what I'm doing or it won't be satisfying enough to make the pain go away. When I look at job postings, which for someone with no skills and no degree are limited and low-paying, all I can think about is that either I'm not good enough for the job (definitely not feeling enthusiastic enough to do sales right now despite all the ads promising big money) or the work will be so menial that my existence will be confirmed as pathetic and miserable. I've created an excuse not to do anything, and at the same time I'm upset that I'm not doing anything. It's a vicious cycle that I won't be able to break unless I pull myself together somehow, but that seems for some reason impossible. I keep waiting for the medications my doctor prescribes to somehow change my outlook, but ultimately I feel like they also won't do anything to fix me without the effort on my part which I don't feel capable of making. I'm trapped in these thoughts I've created for myself and nothing anyone says makes a difference in my perspective. They suggest things to do but nothing is appealing. And so I don't even know why I'm writing this post, because I don't think anyone, even those who can relate to what I'm feeling, can offer anything except sympathy or advice, both of which don't change the state that I'm in. So I'm wondering what I'm supposed to do when treatment isn't working and I've lost the will to make an effort to help myself. The people around me who care about me are getting tired of seeing me like this, and don't understand why I can't just turn things around with positivity and hard work. Why do I feel like I can't help myself?","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

I'm overdue for a mental health plan review with my GP. I had an appointment booked for the review last Tuesday. I had to cancel due to a aura migraine that left me unable to drive and nauseous if I stood up and walked around for too long. Extremely debilitating. They're usually brought on by stress. I've been under a bit of that lately due to the custody changes and having to deal with an extremely bitter and angry ex because I now have majority custody.

Well, today I had to take my father into the day clinic for a Colonoscopy procedure (he has them routinely done every 2 years) and forgot, just plain forgot I had an appointment to see the GP today. I had no idea when dad would need to be collected from the day clinic (my mother doesn't drive and my brother who is Asperger's autistic doesn't handle traffic all that well when he does drive and this is in a high traffic area) so I cancelled my appointment today and reschedule it for Thursday.

Not 15 minutes after I call and reschedule I get a call from the medical centre saying that my regular GP (that has seen my family for over 30 years I might add) no longer wishes to see me and that he will not be accepting any further appointments from me. I lose it. I explain to the reception staff that the last 2 - 3 weeks have been intensely stressful for me and that I've had a bit of difficulty adjusting to the custody change. 

When you've gone from holiday visitation (of up to about 4 weeks at a time) to 24/7 custody it takes a bit of getting used to. I've had to run around enrolling my daughter in school, getting uniforms sorted, seeing psychologist for her that also decided to pike on taking my daughter at the last minute (though she interviewed me) because she accepted a position elsewhere - interstate I think.

So, the psychologist who was supposed to see my daughter didn't, I couldn't go to my appointment last week due to a migraine and this week I cancelled because I had to pick my father up after a medical procedure and I wasn't sure when I'd get the call.

Of all the times he's cancelled on me I don't get any recourse. I can't say ""well, I'm going to charge you for my time because you've cancelled on me and have treated me unfairly'. I get it, I get that they lose money and I was willing to pay for my missed consult but I've had some really heavy shit to deal with the last couple of weeks and it would be nice to be cut a little bit of slack. 

The receptionist said she'd pass on my reasonings but that probably won't cut it and I'll have to start again with another GP. I get the feeling that he's been wanting to not see me for some time but needed an excuse. If he didn't want to treat me in the beginning he should've bloody said something instead of dragging it out like this. The last time I visited him for a script renewal he couldn't wait to get me out of his room. Maybe I am better off with someone else who actually gives a fuck instead of someone who is going through the motions. I just don't know but all I know is that I'm stressed, not sleeping well and feeling very fed up with things.

My daughter has been testing the waters a lot of late and her behaviour hasn't exactly been the best. I know she wants to be here with me but she's trying to see if I'll let her get away with certain behaviours and is acting out when I won't.

Most of all I just wish my daughter's father would start to act like a respectable human being instead of being so horrible all the time. I guess it's never going to change but it would be nice to catch a break from it, just once.

Another thing that isn't helping is that my hormones are all over the shop thanks to TTOTM. I'm also waking up feeling rather hungover from my meds as I'm getting up earlier than I used to as I need to get my daughter ready for school and shaking that cotton brain feeling isn't happening all that well. I need to get my meds reviewed so I can not feel so groggy. Can't do that without a GP and if my GP won't see me who AM I going to see? Someone I don't know?

I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder in late October 2013 but I've known I've had something depression related for a couple of years now. I referred to CAMHS after a multiple signs of suicidally low moods so not just the average mood swing. Then was admitted into an adolescent mental health unit as an inpatient at a place called Riverside. This helped me significantly while I was in a really bad place and space from the internet really seemed to help but after I got better I decided to discharge myself from this unit a few times. After leaving I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 months, which trigger intense low mood and ended with an overdose which resulted in overnight care in A and E.

After going back to Riverside until the new year I eventually left for good and now this brings me to my latest dilema.
I haven't had a proper low mood and my medication seems to be doing the trick it's just during the day I get incredibly bored. Since my dad works full time running his own business and my few close friends are at school while I'm at home (had to drop out of sixth form) I get really bored of not talking to people.

I used to be such a sociable guy, but now i just find myself playing games on my own to fill the empty hours of the day. I just want a little human interaction, is that too much to ask?

Any response is accepted, all messages I receive will be kept anonymous so feel free to message me.

Thank you for listening,
Take care,

I have been living with Bipolar for going on 15 years now. Many of these years I had been self medicating with alcohol. Now that I am 115 days sober and back on medications, I am doing so much better. I still struggle with one thing though. The impulsiveness when I am manic. I seem to be up and borderline manic more than depressed right now so I will take it until we really get my meds dialed in.   How in the hell do I deal with that. I have used other coping skills to deal with much of it but my spending is out of control when I am manic. I will buy, buy, buy with no regard for what I am doing to my family financially. 

Anyone else deal with the impulsiveness when they are up? How do you deal with it? I would so much rather be manic and up than be depressed, suicidal, and hard to be around. I have to get this impulsiveness  shit under control, however.

For quite some time I was capable of functioning somewhat normally without treatment.  I was quite unpleasant to be around and made poor decisions but I could get to work most of the time and make it home afterwards.

The symptoms kept getting worse and worse.  They still are.  I knew something was wrong but tried to keep it together.  I failed.  I wound up in the mental hospital and was diagnosed with bipolar 1.  I tried to write it off as a fluke and weaned myself off of the medication and moved to another state and took another job.  

Of course that didn't work.   I melted down again.  I wound up in hospital after hospital and have tried medication after medication and still I can barely function at all.  My symptoms are severe and getting worse.   My mood is very unstable.  The slightest stress or setback causes anxiety attacks or depression to the point that I wind up curled up in a ball trying not to think of suicide.  Any excitement and I start revving up into hypomania.  Any irritation and the anger builds far more than is reasonable.  I can't work.  I can barely go outside.  I now consider going to the grocery store or yet another mental health appointment by myself an accomplishment of which I can be proud.

And it's still getting worse.  The meds help but only seem to delay the inevitable.

This isn't a life.  This is just existence, survival with no hope.  I have been very suicidal.  I have a plan and it will work.  It has a very very high success rate.  For obvious reasons I will not go into further detail.

There are only a few people left who care about me.  It is for them that I continue to draw breath.  They say that if I die it would mess up their lives.  Despite this I wonder whether or not it would be better just to do it.  If I did I would cause shock and pain and grief but then they would recover and not have to watch what is happening to me.

I know that my judgement is unsound when I get this bad so I just hang on awhile longer.  I can't fail them again.

I honestly don't know whether or not my continued survival is out of strength or if I am just too chickenshit to do it.

Either way I live another fucking day sitting in someone else's spare room wasting oxygen and spewing forth carbon dioxide for no reason at all.

I am still breathing and my loved ones think I am still alive but in a lot of ways I have already died.  I think I have managed to kill myself without killing myself.  I just sit here breathing.  My heart still beats and when my dear friend comes back I can smile and make small talk.  When my family calls I can answer the phone.

When nobody is looking I just... stop.  The lights are on but nobody is home.

Is this it?  Have I finally been defeated?  Have I been broken to such an extent that no repair is possible this time?

Do I still care?  I feel it beginning to start again.  It seems that this post was too much for me today.

Anxiety is affecting my relationship.  It makes me paranoid.

Nothing suspicious. He's never been snappy, snippy, yelled, talked down to me, made me feel bad about anything, made me feel invalidated (not sure if that's a word).  Any concern I've brought to him, he's talked it out with me in a calm, understanding way.  The only bad thing in this situation is....he's across the country.

Six months ago, I was diagnosed as bipolar. Before that, the psychiatrists thought I had depression and later on ADHD. Now she thinks I'm bipolar.

I read a lot about this disorder, and I definitely fit in many aspects. But I also think my manic states are much less severe than most bipolars I read about. Last week I got obsessed with the idea of having a pet wolf, and spent all my free time researching about it (I'm 31 years old, so it's very embarassing). It was certainly a crazy obsession, but with no major consequences. And that's the problem. What if I just have an obsessive, impulsive personality?

I tend to spend money a lot. I also used to cheat my girlfriends like a crazy person, and I remember long periods in wich I endured in awful behaviors. I once had a double life for two months, having two girlfriends at the same time, even though I find this type of behaviour completely wrong. Obviously, the results were catastrophic. Also, my mood is very irregular. Sometimes I simply ignore everyone, while in other occasions I'm very playfull, funny, extroverted and energetic.

I don't know, maybe I'm just expecting someone to tell me there's nothing wrong with me. From what I read, I think I must be type 2. Today, my ""manic states"" are always about some kind of stupid internet obsession and crazy expenses. 

Maybe the meds are working and I simply forgot what It was to be sick. I even thought about stop taking them for a few days to actually see the difference.

It would certainly help to hear about other people with similar thoughts.

I had an affair on my husband with a colleague a little while ago and almost destroyed everything with my husband not too long after.

We have a young son and he means the world to both of us.

During my manic episode, I fell in love with a really good colleague (male) and although we never had sex, I tried to and still desperately wish we had.

I have never been much of a sexual person, I always thought it was normal not to have a sex drive.

That's where I issue comes in.

After I told my husband of the affair, I eventually came back to him one night and explained that I was leaving him because I wasn't happy with him anymore.  I don't remember all the reasons now, but it happened.

I eventually asked him for another chance, and he has been incredibly supportive and he decided we could work at rebuilding the marriage.  He has been such a great friend and great husband.  He's attractive, caring, gentle, funny and does a whole lot to make sure I am OK when I fall into my pit.

Yet, with everything that makes me so happy about him, I keep thinking of the man I had an affair with.  He makes me manic, both good and bad.  I haven't spoken to him since my husband and I got back together.  And it hurts so much not having the other guy in my life again.

I lie when I tell my husband that it's more the loss of a friend, but I'm still in love with him.  He is also married and has a little girl.

I am not sure if the medication is keeping me from wanting sex, but in the last two months we have barely kissed.  He tries often, showers me with love yet I can't find it in me to approach him sexually.  Ever.

Is this medication or something else?  Will I ever get back to a point with my husband that I can make love and WANT to again?

I'm afraid of driving him away, but we have such a great relationship otherwise.  We're always talking, he listens to me when I'm very low and always encourages me to be better.  He sees me for who I am, and that means a lot...

But why I can't I find that sexual side of our relationship again?  I told him that when the time was ready, but what does that mean?  How am I ""ready"" to have sex or have any desire to be physically intimate with him if I am not right now.

I still feel guilt for what I did, but I can't get this other guy out of my head.  Any others out there with similar stories?  Maybe someone has something they could share?

I've come out from lurking for so long on here, I feel like sometimes I'm getting OK, but then I try and make other things work in this relationship and I just can't do it.

I'm on a mobile and we are desperate. My family and I need some help. Our father was diagnosed bipolar about 10 years ago. Since then (well since always) it has been an uphill battle to help him be a happier healthier person. We don't have delusions of grandeur but we would want to see him be able to do the dishes and get through holidays without having a major blow out. He hasn't been to the hospital in 2 years, but it also hasn't been a good 2 years.

This week has definitely been the worst. My dad had been scaring my mom to the point that she wanted him to go to the hospital and get his meds checked. He agreed after a lot of convincing. When they got to the hospital, there was a cop there trying to push my dad over the edge into physical violence and arrest him. They were in a barren room practically interrogating him about being homicidal. I should point out that my dad is not homicidal, he is suicidal. I have never been afraid for anything other than his own safety. My mom wasn't allowed back there with him when she learned that this was the hospitals policy. Mom refused to let him stay there because this cop was being so aggressive with her, the hospital staff, other people in the waiting room, and my mentally ill father. This all happened over the down of about 5 to 6 hours and a lot of stuff happened that I'd rather  not go in to. It makes me sick just thinking about this. 

So my mom took him home while she could figure out what to do. He was on his best behavior for a day or two when they decided I should try taking him to a different hospital. That Sunday I drove to their house to pick him up and take him to the hospital. We drove about an hour and a half to the next hospital and listened to the hawks win! That put him in a really good mood and he was ready for the inevitable emergency room wait. 

I was shocked at the room he was put in. I wasn't allowed back there for about 2 hours. It was again a barren room with nothing but a pad on the floor for him to lay on. I was heartbroken. My dad is 53 years old. He's broken his right arm multiple times and shattered his shoulder. I asked to speak to his nurse and was able to get him a chair. I asked if they had taken his blood sugar as he has diabetes. They said they weren't aware. I told them he had been to this hospital many times and asked if they had even looked at his records. All I got were blank stares. 

Today I get a frantic call from my mother saying they are trying to release him already. He is on new medication. What if he has a reaction or they don't work? Do we hospitalize him again? The hospital doesn't care enough to keep him but we know he isn't ready to come back home. 

I'm at a loss for what we should do. We love out father more than any thing in the world and would happily give up anything to make his happiness possible.We are getting as much help as we know how to do and my dad is on disability. We also live in the US.

About six months ago I began to see a therapist for the first time in my life at the behest of my boyfriend. He urged me to go after I took an overdose of tramadol, a pain killer, and had to be taken to the ER. There I was reviewed by a staff psychiatrist and given the information of several doctors in my area. After a few more weeks of urging I finally relented and went to my first therapy session. My bf had been telling me that I display some bipolar tendencies based on his experience with bipolar friends in the past. My therapist however decided that this wasn't the case after 2 or 3 visits. 

Despite the affirmation from the doc, my lows seemed to come much stronger than usual and I was eventually prescribed celexa and an anti-anxiety sleep aid. About a week into the celexa I found myself crying daily for seemingly no reason, and my mind became preoccupied with thoughts of despair. Just this last week I had to call my doctor on the weekend and explained to her through my tears that I thought that my meds were making things worse. I just got back from an appointment yesterday where after relaying recent events to the dr, was told that I am exhibiting bipolar behavior and that the SSR med I was taking would likely make things worse, since what i really need is a mood stabilizer.

The diagnosis of bipolar after previously being told that was not the case is disheartening. I don't want to be bipolar, nor do I think I am, despite what my boyfriend and dr say on the matter. I should mention that I don't feel particularly impulsive, aside from sexual urges I get with my boyfriend which have us doing semi-risky things from time to time. I do cut myself once in awhile to cope with some of the more severe lows.

That leads me to this: How many redditors had been diagnosed with some other condition before finally getting saddled with the bipolar title? Did you find yourself in denial, second guessing your dr? 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, your input is greatly appreciated.

Years ago when my anorexia really *took over*, I got down to a pretty low weight. I stopped menstruating, I became really sickly, I was depressed, and all sorts of other negative side effects presented themselves. I don't know exactly when it ""changed"" but I now have issues with a binge/starve cycle. I will starve myself for days before going on a couple of days long binge. My doctor questioned what a ""binge"" is to me, and apparently I don't fit that ""criteria"" but a binge to me is eating much more than I usually do in a short amount of time to make myself feel full. Only then comes the starvation period again. On and on and on. 

When I really analyze the pattern it seems to be in line with my manic/depressive phases. Sometimes I have mixed moods and feel two ways about binging or starving. Currently, I feel the need to stuff myself and eat poorly. I've been doing well in life, but some things are missing that make me feel depressed or stress me out. When I feel good about things or triggers aren't worrying me, I stop binging and start starving. 

Part of me (disgustingly) wishes that I could just starve to that low weight again, while the other part of me wants to just be healthy already. Unfortunately, healthy to me is having to see my bones and *look* thin. So most medications for bipolar are completely out of the question for me because I refuse to gain any weight that I can't easily lose. I'm currently on tegretol because my psychiatrist prescribed it to me because he thought it might help, plus he told me it wouldn't make me gain weight. I'm not sure if it is working on its own because I still feel these dips of depression and highs of mania through the leveled out feeling. 

tl;dr:
Anyone else suffering from eating disorders and bipolar? Do you see a link between the two? Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this?

I was once told that because I’m bipolar, I didn’t have a real personality, I wasn’t really capable of true emotions and feelings…everything I felt, every emotion, every reason behind those emotions…it was all the manifestation of a chemical imbalance in my brain.
At first, I was almost tempted to believe them. After all, I had never felt like I was in control of my mind, it was a crazy colorful tangle of rapid ideas, of dark heavy consuming emptiness, something that made me crazy. 




Crazy. What does that word truly mean? I waited, for years, constantly told that there was something off about me, something wrong, something that had to be fixed, mended, corrected. It was never simply just “That’s who she is, and we love her for it.” No, there had to be a solution, somewhere, something that could fix me.




I learned recently, that many children with bipolar disorder are often misdiagnosed as having other disorders, like ADHD. So, I suppose looking back on it, that it only makes sense that my parents had me in a psychiatrists office when I was just out of my toddler years. It was a strange experience, one that I can remember oddly well, driving to the office, having so many trips that even as young as I was, I had memorized the way. I remember a man with a notepad who would talk to me as I played with a dollhouse…never really moving the dolls or saying their conversations aloud. Even then, I was always too busy in my mind to come out for very long. Play, for me, was a very personal thing. Inside my mind, there were no rules, no boundaries to hold me back, there…I was free. There were no blue pills, Ritalin that had been prescribed and administered, making me into a lifeless drone. No other kids thinking I was weird, calling me names, ostracizing me because I wasn’t the same as they were.




That didn’t change for a really, really long time. I was always the weird girl, the one who had a strong personality, but a small build and a very real fear of confrontation. I would set up my dolls and stare at them, and instead of moving their arms and legs, they came to life in my head. When we were outside for recess, I would look out over the grassy prairies of Southern Colorado and imagine I was a horse, or a pioneer, or on some other grand adventure. There were times when all I wanted to do was run and laugh and giggle, talking quickly, making wild gestures, having a million ideas that seemed to come to me effortlessly. There were other times when I would sit and stare and my mind was quiet, and dark, and almost hollow, and I would feel my eyes prick and I wouldn’t understand why. I still have those moments, fairly often in fact. And somehow, even though I can give it a name, I still don’t really understand it.




That’s the hardest part. How can I expect someone else to understand something that even I don’t? To be able to look at me and know that I’m more than just a manifestation of brain chemicals gone haywire? My parents had always told me that there was something that could be fixed, that medicine would make me feel better, have more control over my anger and outbursts and meltdowns. What they were saying for all those ears wasn’t really that I was broken, or damaged, but that is exactly the sentiment that has burrowed itself deep, deep into my psyche. I never, ever thought that anyone would really, truly love me, or understand me, or accept me. Not fully. Because there was a part of me that didn’t make sense, that couldn’t be controlled, a dragon on a leash so to speak, and sometimes the chain broke, sometimes there was fire, and sometimes he seemed to be asleep. It wasn’t me, though. Sure, it was a part of me, one that I battled and one that I tried to tame, one that took a lot of work to deal with and challenged my coping skills.




And then, things started to change. There was a boy, someone who thought I was interesting, who listened, who cared. Who wanted to understand me, and who didn’t seem to care about my weirdness…he even liked it. And there was an amazing girl, someone who I could talk to, and she got it. She understood. We were to each other someone who would never be “that person” who would try to give advice based on reading WebMD or Googling things, pretending they’re experts. Or that forever awful mantra of “it can’t be that bad”, or, “if you just try a little harder”, or, “come on, snap out it.” Sometimes, I just needed someone to listen, or to hold me, and yes, there were times when I just needed to be told it’ll be okay. And both of them did that. It was glorious. For what seemed like the first time in my life, I didn’t always feel broken, and I felt like I might actually be worthy of love, and most importantly, that I was loved. For who I am.




That is not to say that they are the only people who love me. But they way they love me, the way they treat me, and try to help in a way that goes against making me feel broken or damaged, it was new and beautiful and intoxicating. I felt like the luckiest girl in the world, to finally feel like I had found people, that they loved me and I loved them.




There are always struggles. Sometimes life decides to kick you while you’re on your feet and you fall on your ass, and sometimes it kicks you while you’re down. That happens to everyone, it’s normal. With me though, it’s harder sometimes. When life gets too difficult, especially when I am stressed, the dragon knows the chain is more brittle, and he rears his ugly head. Sometimes I cry, for hours, and I couldn’t for the life of me tell you why. Sometimes I scream and throw myself on the floor and hate everything and everyone and even the air pisses me off. Sometimes it takes everything in me to get out of bed in the morning or force a smile. Sometimes I even lose track of reality, and things get fuzzy, my thoughts don’t make sense and vanish into thin air. I can’t make sense of anything, especially myself, and it is frustrating and terrifying and painfully exhausting. Sometimes I am ultra-rapid cycling so fast that I don’t even know what I’m feeling, why or what to do.  Sometimes, I am what most people would call normal. I am happy or sad or angry and I’m just being human, having that middle ground where most people spend their lives, no super high highs or dismally down lows.




The thing I have learned though, is that I am not my disorder. Bipolar doesn’t own me. It may snap it’s jaws, or roar or try to claw me to pieces, but I am not just the walking manifestation of brain chemistry run amuck. It has given me a few of the facets of myself I treasure most, my creativity, my sense of childlike wonder, a great deal of coping skills. I am a young woman who HAS bipolar, not one who IS bipolar. And though sometimes it takes everything in me to remind myself of that, I know that it’s the truth.

A few months ago (like 3 or 4), I went to my psych with a Differential Diagnosis of ADHD, but when she heard about my reaction to Zoloft, she told me the symptoms I thought were ADHD were probably bipolar. ""Constantly shifting moods can make it hard to concentrate,"" she said. 

I also have periods of depression, but I've always doubted that I had unipolar depression, which was what all my other psychs told me. It never, ever lasts more than a week at a time. However, my baseline is super low and it has been since childhood so I don't really know anything else. My psych says that my brief moments of motivation are hypomania, but I'm doubtful.

Anyway, she prescribed me 200mg of Lamictal which seemed to work for a while. I didn't despite myself and humanity with the hatred of a thousand suns, and I could get through a week without having a massive crying fit about nothing. But I told her I still had a baseline of ""always sad, yet functional"" and she seemed perturbed by this, because I guess it goes against her diagnosis? (She actually said she thought I had ""mostly hypomanic features"".) So she upped it to 300mg. 

She also gave me Buspar for anxiety, but I'm used to klonopin and I don't really feel like it's doing anything. She said that Buspar also has an ""immediate calming effect,"" which I just plain old don't believe.

So I started getting lightheaded and assumed it was the cocktail so here I am now on 200mg Lamictal and 5mg Buspar. I don't really feel like it's working with my depression. (Which I don't even really think is pure old depression, I'm 80% sure it's anxiety in a variety of forms.) And since it took away my ""highs"" aka feeling semi-good, I have no safe respite from being down ALL THE TIME. And I can't drink anymore either. 

Along with the ""highs,"" it's taken away all my motivation and interest in things, and I feel kind of stupid too. Like not as clear. And my focus is just as bad as ever. My psych doesn't want to give me stimulants because it might ""exascerbate my anxiety,"" but I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with a mood disorder and anxiety and focus issues. It's like such a common trio but all the meds for each cancel each other out in a way. 

I might just be imagining my pre-med state with rose colored glasses, but it just doesn't seem like they're doing enough for me to want to continue taking them. I just want stimulants for day and benzos for night but I know I need a long term solution at some point. But I just don't feel like those solutions will be powerful enough, I guess?

ON TO THE RELATIONSHIP!

So this guy likes me.  I'm willing to put my money on that he loves me.  Maybe even in love with me.  We've known each other for maybe 10 years.  He's expressed interest a few times before, but I never moved forward with it.  Thing is...he's still here.  And lately especially I've done a pretty good job of showing him my crazy (Not on purpose, and minus the hallucinations and delusions i used to have).  He knows my past, he knows about my episodes, he knows everything.  The problem?  I don't feel romantically about him.  There's no way for me to tell you how bad I want to..because this guy has treated me better than anyone else..ever.  He has always done what was in my best interest.  He's never left me..and the one time I felt like he had and I expressed it to him and explained how it hurt my feelings, he apologized so much and told me it wasn't like that and he hasn't done it since.  
Anything that I could think of that might be holding my feelings back, I've expressed to him..and anything that he could work on he has.  But those romantic feelings aren't there...and I want them there.

What do I do?  I try to live by ""fake it 'til you make it"" because the mind is stronger than people want to give it credit for..but does that work with love?  Is there any way I can fall in love with him?

SO...there we are.

EDIT: TL;DR: 
Medicine: How do I approach my therapist and doctor about feeling like my meds aren't working, but stay adamant about not changing antidepressants?

I just feel like, what do these people need to realize I'm going through some shit? A mental breakdown? I feel like I'm fighting one. Should I just let it happen and embarrass myself but then someone will finally realize I'm not just joking around about feeling horrible and anxious and so depressed (definitely a mixed cycle going on here). I'm hearing stuff. I thought maybe I should go to the hospital but the therapist said that would stop when they got me on medicine.


I feel a little selfish. I just want someone to awknowledge that this is hard. I want people not to sigh and act like I'm being annoying when I tell them I just need to be around someone and have them give me some attention so I can focus on anything besides death or cutting or running away or creating the next great art exhibit. 


I'm tired. I'm so freaking tired and this stupid medicine should help me sleep but it doesn't.


That is all. Just needed a little vent. You guys rock. Stay strong out there and I will try to stay strong too.

The medication works, but does not take away the extreme loathing and bitterness I hold against my existence. I know others have it far worse; it doesn't change how I feel at all. Please, no ""seek medical help!"" posts. I know what I'm doing, and the choice is mine, no matter how much others try to say it's not a choice. And currently I am ""normal,"" and still wish this. 

STORY: I am intelligent to the point I can never be satisfied with what I can obtain with constant career changes, but not intelligent enough to easily master the more difficult careers, in order to acquire a position with no experience. Life becomes more weary as each year passes. The medication sustains me, but it only provides borrowed time. Eventually the final break will come; I have accepted it.

Still, there are nights where I try to comprehend what eternity without ever existing again ""feels"" like, and the will to exist becomes overpowering. The next day my mind returns to normal, and I can think logically again; one who doesn't exist cannot feel eternity passing without existence.

I wish to share my feelings with others who understand me. For whatever reason, this brings me a lot of comfort. My family did not prepare me for this problem, partially due to the mental state of my bipolar parent. That person has caused a lot of pain and misery, but, as an adult also suffering, I have felt more compassion and understanding for that parent's plight and own ruined years. 

Still, I hold extreme anger. I always have a plan to perform the most gruesome suicide at the rare family get-together. The time passes, then I leave, knowing my death will be quiet. A simple hanging in the closet, or a gunshot on a remote hill. 

I was the class clown, the friend to all, and the ambitious one. I was the one certain I would be a medical doctor with a simple, but perfect, life. As I left high school behind, those ""hickups"" in my mental state became a lot more common and prolonged. I began to lose interest in everything, even when I felt well. I eventually came to accept I would not be a doctor.  I did not want to be one anymore. I would not have a simple, perfect life. My life would be short and full of misery.

Most of my original cells have passed, so the memories I store in my mind must be my consciousness; who I am. The illness has changed my experiences, which have created unpleasant memories. These memories have accumulated, and continue to change who I am. I have become weaker, more remorseful, more agitated, less friendly and kind, more ... someone else.

This someone else does not desire existence, nor treat it as a gift. It sees living as suffering, and wants to end the journey. It practices the final execution, finding opportunities to push itself. It has to fight harder, to triumph over the millions of cells screaming to live. The screaming becomes so loud when it blacks out on the noose, or holds the gun to the back of its head. It's an incredible scream, a loud feeling, a terrible feeling, but a feeling it is slowly learning to overcome with each passing attempt.

I don't feel this is a crazy ramble. I feel others have the same feelings and experiences. Please share. 

This is not my main account, of course. I am one of you, with the occasional comment to share. Please, no personal messages. Just comments.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Let's just start by saying the last time I was insured was when I was 25.  It wasn't a problem back then Doc put me on some great meds.  I was stable and happy.  I didn't have any money to pay for them so I called the community program here that deals with mental health coverage.  Unfortunately, I did not qualify for their services.  Their main reasoning was I was not a severe case and they simply did not have the budget to accommodate me.

But that was OK because I was able to qualify for a program by the drug manufacturers to get the drugs for free.  Everything that I've done so far in life has been to work hard to find a good job and get decent health coverage.  I never thought I would end up in the crap hole I am in today.

Fast forward 9 years.  I'm 34 years old.  Unemployed.  Single.  And STILL have no health coverage.  What happened?  Well the meds were working great.  I was able to live on my own, independently.  Find a great job, go to college and actually get my degree.  How amazing was that?  My life seems to be going in all the right directions.  All my dreams would soon come true.  

**Except they didn't.**

During my last year of college, I began to feel symptoms of depression once again.  I was able to graduate, but by the skin of my teeth.  The failure of that year began to eat away at me.  The symptoms became worse.  I couldn't find a job.  I did poorly at interviews.  Pretty soon, I didn't have the energy to try to apply.  I was lost and confused.  I felt like an empty shell of a person.  A soulless creature, wandering through the night.  It was at this point I realized, my medication stopped working.

I figured if the medication didn't work, what was the point of taking it? If I was going to be depressed, at least I could be depressed without all these nasty side effects.  So that's when I weened off my medication.

I actually got a little better surprisingly.  I was able to find some temporary work. I was feeling better.  Then the work stopped and back crept my depression.

Since then, I have desperately been trying to find treatment.  I went directly to an insurance agent to find a quote.  The following week, I got a phone call from them.  They said they looked everywhere, but there was no insurance that would give them a quote because of my pre-existing conditions.

I thought, OK, no problem.  I'm sure there's some sort of government assistance program that could help me.  So I went searching online.

**Eureka!**

Found one.  It was called [PCIP](http://www.healthcare.gov/law/features/choices/pre-existing-condition-insurance-plan/index.html).  It was government assisted insurance that I could buy that accepted pre-exsisting conditions.  I was happy again.  I had hope.  All I had to do was get my tax return (I didn't file one last year) and I should qualify.  I was finally going to get treatment.

**No, not this time.**

My boss at the time took forever to tell me how he was going to file me (He was paying me cash I expected him to file a 1099 on me) But he took forever, till the last minute.  When he finally told me that he wasn't going to file a 1099 on me, I did my taxes immediately.  First time I did them in advance before the deadline.  I was desperate to finally get treatment.

**Sorry to burst your bubble.  Again.**

It wasn't going to happen.  I logged onto the website and the first thing I see is this:

*Beginning February 16, 2013, the federally-run Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) is suspending acceptance of new enrollment applications until further notice.*

**I was crushed.**

My heart sank.  I didn't know what to do.  How was I going to get treatment now?  Keep in mind, all this hoop jumping has been extraordinarily difficult while you suffer with severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder.  My critical thinking was just about as useful as spoiled meat.  And every corner I had peeked had been nothing but disappointment, which led to severe anxiety attacks every time I tried to search for an alternate route.  I was running out of options.

My final, desperate solution was something I felt very ashamed of.  I had to call Mom, and ask her for help.  This made me feel like a failure, but I had no choice.  I needed to see a doctor, and everything I had tried had failed.  My only solution was to pay out of pocket and go see a doctor.  It was going to be expensive, but I figured if it helped me feel better and get on with my life it would be worth it.  So I made an appointment.

My doctor gave me a prescription of Welbutrin and Seroquel.  At first the side effect were brutal, but after a while they subsided.  I was starting to feel better.  I think...either way, it was the best step in the right direction.  All I had to do was see my doctor and everything would be fine.

**Or so I thought.**

When I called back to to let the doctor know how I was feeling and to schedule another appointment I was met with a shocking discovery.  My doctor had instructed the secretary to tell me that I cannot make another appointment.  The doctor did not want to see me if I was going to pay out of pocket.  He claimed it was because he understood my financial situation.  

What in the?  Where did this come from?  I willing willing to pay for everything!  The pain had been too much these past couple of years!  I was desperate!  I didn't care how much it costed, I just wanted it it end!  I wanted it to all go away.  Is there any help for me?  Am I doomed to be this way for ever?  Why has it been so hard for me to find mental health treatment?  Isn't there a safety net for people like me?  Isn't there some way the government can help?

Surprisingly enough...the answer was...*""sort of"".*  After that, I had decided to call the community program for mental health in hopes that maybe I might qualify for their program this time.  It was my final option.  If this did not work, then the only other choice would have been the unthinkable.  Death.

They informed me that they were going to set me up with another appointment to asses my situation. They said it was likely I wouldn't qualify but that they could put me on their waiting list to get coverage in the future.  I thought to myself.  ""Well hey.  That's not too bad.  How long is the waiting list?""

""2 to 3 years.""

**Dear god why?**

Was this it?  Was I counting down my last breaths?  My hope had dwindled into a faint flame fighting to survive against the wind, flickering in and out.

The medical assistant kindly showed up to my apartment to conduct the interview.  I told her my story.  I told her how depressed I was, I told her that I had tried everything, but nothing had worked.  I told her how frustrated I was and how hopeless I felt.

She listened with concerned, squinting eyes.  Then suddenly...

**Perhaps there is a god.**

She told me she would over ride the 2-3 year waiting period.  She felt that I could greatly benefit from their services because I have shown positive improvement in the past.  I just needed a jump start to get my life going.

Their services aren't that great, but at least its something.  I get to see a doctor next week.  I'll be able to get free medication but I will only see a doctor once every 3 months.

I'm very worried right now because it took me something like 6 years to find the right kind of medication that actually worked well.  During that time, I went to the doctor frequently.

I feel like they are dropping me off on a desert island with a parachute, a knife and a first aid kit and saying, ""K see ya in three months!  Have fun out there!""

I am in no way prepared to do this on my own without some guidance.  I am scared.  Yes, there is still hope, but so much uncertainty lies ahead.

**TL;DR Its been a frustrating experience trying to find mental health coverage.  I found some from a community program...but I need so much more.  I'm worried and scared.**","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

&lt;

Being Bipolar is like having a disease which people still talk to you like normal, because you are in the middle of sane and insane.

You hear stories, people are bipolar, and they are the greatest writers, poets, story tellers, they are unlike anyone else. But most of those people kill themselves in the end.

When you figure it out, you are relieved you found what it is. And yet, as you learn more and more, you just realize it’s been like that forever and will never get better. You’ve never been “normal”. You never will be. There might be slight chances of you being ok, but it never “improves” like other diseases, it just goes away for a while. You still have the same thoughts and feelings, they just tell you how to ignore them.

Taking meds help some people, but in others it doesn’t help at all. I can take some for a few months and then just stop, they don't work anymore, so I don’t like them. Some meds will work with these people, but not these other people. Why? We really aren’t sure. What causes it? Well, we know what can cause it, but ultimately don’t know what the direct root cause is. The side effects themselves suck, you become a zombie, you can’t remember anything, you stop all emotions, you lose what is essentially, you. 

They tell you what to expect, which you also learn as you interact with people. It’s not something you can tell them right off the bat. It’s not something you can really hide from people, eventually they suspect things. It’s not easy to tell others about it, and you tend to stay lonely because others have a hard time understanding. And you have a hard time controlling emotions and behaviors. Myself, I’ve not been in relationships in years. I barely have any friends I really hang out with. I maybe talk to one every day, but that’s it. 

When you tell others, you have to tread lightly, some people will accept it, some will reject it. You can try to make those people understand, but they will never realize the full extent unless they feel it. It’s not something you want to have. It’s not something you want to do. It just happens. Triggers can be anything, any sight, any thought, any memory. After a while, you just stop telling people and let them think you are better. But in reality, it’s still there constantly nagging at you. Sometimes you try to kill yourself slowly, and that doesn’t work well. You try to stay “sane” by any measures. Drugs, sex, addiction, abuse, anything to stop the brain from “craving”. 

Try exercise they say, I hate it, I can do it if I force myself but every time I step off the treadmill I just lie and say “that felt good”. And within an hour, i’m back to normal.

Meet others, you’ll feel better. Not if you’re introverted. I even like meeting people, but not in big groups and whatnot. I don’t initiate conversations well. How do you start? I have plenty of things to talk about, but I don’t know the other person. After talking to them for a few minutes, I already know where the conversation is going to go and almost give up, it will go nowhere. They aren’t interesting. Being alone is a trigger, and yet it’s a sanctuary, it makes you feel safe, and you know it’s holding you back, but if you venture further, you don’t know what kind of person you will turn out to be. People fuel you and your personalities and you do the same. I tried a bit more and I hated myself more and more as I went further. 

Go to therapy they say, it changed my life. I just don’t have time with work, and I get tired by the time I’m home. I’m tired of telling other people about my problems. They want “Group” therapy, which I hate, I don’t like talking in groups. Sometimes I start talking and start rambling and can’t stop, but most of the time, I just stay quiet. If you were in my head for a day, you’d go insane. 

By the way, you could get manic or hypomanic and start acting entirely different like another person. Spend money, do things you wouldn’t normally do, say things, be more charismatic, more ideas, seems good if you had all the resources. You make amazing creations. But also, you fall, which sucks because it’s the worst depression, it happens out of nowhere, and you don’t know when, you just know it will. You won’t want to get out of bed. You don’t want to see anyone. You dislike life and everything about it. And that can last months. The highs can last weeks, and depending, you want it to last more, and go higher. It’s like the ultimate drug. You feel amazing, better, king of the world, know what to say, when, new ideas no one else has thought of, and yet, they tell you it’s just a state. But I want to stay in the state. The problems arise when you do things first without thinking and then come back and see what you did. 

By the way, anything bad you do, will be because of this, most people will blame it on mental illness, not the circumstances. But it’s still your fault. You cracked. Should have been more careful. Now you go to jail, we’ll make you better there. 

It’s like a bad dream. You feel things differently. Your personality changes. You’re usually alone most of the time. You rarely find people who can relate. You are crazy, but only at certain times. Anything can trigger it. Many people barely keep jobs because they go from crazy productive to no production at all. You get mad, sad, happy, at random times. You’ll be with it forever, until your last breath. You wake up every day wondering how you feel that day and who you are. Most people who know about it put you on the cautious list, it’s like a ticking time bomb. You hate it, and want to die, but hey, suicide is illegal, you can’t do that. You must carry out your days. And hey, you can’t sleep, despite how much rest you get, you never feel energized. And you can’t eat sometimes, you just don’t want food. And the things you liked, well, you don’t like them anymore, sorry. And guess what, you're paranoid now! Good luck managing that for a few weeks.
 
Maybe that’s why we do drugs. To stop the brain from thinking. Not to get high. To become normal. 

That’s why you limit the people who know about it. They always wonder about you. Why do you do these things. Why do you hurt yourself. But you don’t have a real answer. Just reassure them you are ok and they will be happy again.

People like you when you are amped up, in a good mood, they try to push you that way. And you like it too, but you know where it could end up. Influences on the outside are just as bad. But if you don’t do it, people don’t talk to you as much. You feel alone again.

Feel shitty? Just get through work. Then you get home and relax, do whatever you need to feel better. Forget to shower or brush teeth? Eh, worry about it tomorrow. Messy house? Leave it for a week or two. Projects? Let’s think of 100! And then do none. Let’s get a better job, apply at 4-5 places, then don’t call back. You have the feeling in the back of your head that something big will go wrong and you’ll get fired. Amazed I haven’t gotten fired already. 

I fight it daily. I don’t know what I want anymore. I don’t know what will make me happy. I don’t know if anyone will ever make me happy. I don’t really want kids. I barely want to live, I still haven’t decided if I want to live entirely just yet. Truth be told, I really don’t even want to do that. 

I can do well, for weeks, months, but the feeling comes back, I want to start fucking up again, things are going too well, and I know something is bound to happen. So I make it happen myself. Stay away from influences, they are bad, they say. Why? So things can be dull and boring again? Why even live then? If you can’t enjoy life, what purpose is there to live? 

It’s like all the mental illnesses into one big package. Congratulations. 


edit: truth is, I wish I had someone. I can't find anyone. I try, and always fail. It always ends the same. So I gave up years ago and every time I still try, it feels the same. I'll figure it out someday.

I did some research online and found there were certain drugs that can treat Akathisia.  Why didn't my doctor give me a prescription to one of those drugs?  One of the was benadryl.  Why didn't he tell me to take that drug?

I'm trying benadryl right now.  I think it me be helping.  Has anyone gone through something similar?  Did your Akathisia go away with time?  Should I try to tough this out?

currently im having extreme audio/visual hallucinations and panic attacks as well as being on the extreme end of a manic episode pushing 3 months now im up for up to 72 hours at a time and even with valium i can not sleep. i rarely eat as well. i have not left my room in my house apart from hospital visits and doctors visits. i was tested and diagnosed with bipolar 2/personality disorder 4 years ago and after seeing my mother and grandmother and my sister and other members of my family suffer through it for many many years (mums 45 and was tested and diagnosed at 37) i did not want to admit it was problem i still refuse to admit i have it around others. i have so much fear so much pain and self doubt. so many people look down on me for it. my own family feel if i dont treat it there way and inorge the problem and do everything 200% better then everyone else im not worthy to breath air. i have signs of extreme ptsd from being moved around extremely abusive foster homes and being forced to live on the streets by family for a few years. my own family was extremely abusive and some still are even now that im comming up on 21. i dont drink i dont smoke i dont drive more then once a month as i get extreme panic attacks and the like. the presure on me has reached new extremes lately. i use gaming and graphic work and pc building to vent i live in a very small town with less then 60 people and i cant get out of the town everyone here is 40 years older everyone is hostile they see me as some sort of enemy or something. i don't leave the house as people from around the area have taken to abusing me or attacking me or outright trying to assault me. the town is small enough and far enough from the city that we do not have cops or firefighters and the ambos take over an hour to respond even with heart attacks. i dont know what to do i dont know where i go from here. i cant afford anything else. i can hardly afford food. and its getting harder. the government system changes mean in the coming weeks i will see my medications go up and my medical payments go down. i'm living off so little i cant even pay for basics. even medication is becoming hard to afford. phones don't work here we don't even have a phone line. there are no towers. everything is satellite based and extremely costly (100mb for 50 dollars) i can not for the life of me see any way to get out and the only doctor i can see sees me for 5 minutes tells me hes doing medication changes or nothing at all and kicks me out. not talking no support no help. nothing.

i'm honestly on the edge of ending it all. i have been for months but i cant bring my self to do it after losing my ex that way. i know how much it will hurt those i love but i don't see any way out. the debts are already building and i cant pay them and i have 2 extensions and in some cases 3. in just power  i owe my monthly wage 5x over. and we have no water without the power as were on tanks. i dread the day they turn off the power as they will turn off the water at the same time. i dont know what to do from here. i cant afford help and this may well be it.","['compound', 'compound', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

A few people have asked me to write an update, so here you are! I found it very helpful so I will try to be as complete as I can without divulging private info (which probably would not help you anyway, since you aren't me).

The first thing we did was talk about my history of symptoms and what meds I've tried. I have bipolar type I with psychosis. The meds that work best for me are lithium, haldol, and klonopin. Unfortunately haldol has a lot of side effects so we're trying to avoid it. I brought in a three page typed summary of my mental health from childhood onwords. I also listed all of my vitamins, supplements, and meds with their dose. This was really helpful for organizing the discussion, so I highly recommend that you do something similar if you have a consultation.

Next, he brought out a [chart](http://imgur.com/DhMf9OZ) with potential medications. He explained how each class works in your brain (there are some pictures that I didn't upload where he sketched neurotransmitters) and suggested some medications for me based on my symptoms. I don't know what all the colors mean, sorry. 

He brought out a booklet that can be used as a 6 month [mood](http://imgur.com/hC3IOeh) [diary](http://imgur.com/lFaHkty). I don't know where to buy them but he gave me five of them. We practiced using it for a few minutes.

He gave me a [newsletter](http://imgur.com/WZhTtSC) which can be found online at bipolarnews.org. 

Finally, and most importantly, he wrote up a NINE POINT PLAN with nine different medication suggestions - mostly meds I had never heard of. It's a letter addressed to my current psychiatrist, who referred me for the consultation. I'm really optimistic about the medications he suggested. I am not sharing them because this is highly individualized and I don't know if they would help you, but they are all listed in image 1 and I recommend sharing that image with your doctor if you want to make a medication change. The letter does cite sources for all of the medications (studies) which is also very helpful. I scanned the letter and emailed it to my doctor, so we'll be able to talk about it at our next appointment.

If you live in the mid Atlantic region and are interested in something like this I can PM you more info. I am sure other doctors offer a similar service in other parts of the country. I paid $700 out of pocket though - I'm not sure how much my insurance will reimburse. I think it was worth it because this is hopefully a once in a lifetime expense.

Pay attention to that chart guys. If you are not feeling well you have a LOT of options and classes of medications which might help you. A LOT. More than I had any awareness of, and that chart isn't even complete. DON'T GIVE UP. If you feel like meds just don't work for you there is a strong possibility that you just have not been on the right meds, and I doubt you've tried all of the possibilities. Some medications also make other drugs work better. I really had no idea how many options there were and I feel much more optimistic now.","['compound', 'pobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

I don't know many people around where I live, I've looked and there are no support groups for people whose significant others have bipolar, and I don't have the time or energy to start something like that. 

I just need someone to talk to. We've been dating for almost 9 months. When we first met she was strong and independent, she got things done and didn't need anyone to take care of her. She was upfront about being bipolar, and looking back I think she was in the midst of a manic episode that seemed to have lasted for months. Now shes in a depressive episode, and has been for months (it feels like so much longer), and she basically does nothing all day. She sits in bed, she chain smokes cigs, and plays on her phone. Thats about it. I support her, I work full time, I pay for all of her doctor visits and her meds, I pay for all of her habits (weed and cigs), I drive her everywhere, I do all the shopping, all the cooking, all the cleaning, and honestly Im at my wits end. 

I love her so much, but this relationship is wearing me down. Im always exhausted, I have very little time to myself, and I feel like there is always something to do and Im upset that im the one who always has to do it. 

I try to be understanding. We are good about communicating our feelings, but the last week I've been so depressed, almost to the point of being suicidal (im ok now, but for a few days I just didn't feel anything). I just don't see an end. Is this what the rest of my life is gonna be like? Because Im not certain I can handle it. I can't be the only responsible one in this relationship. 

And I just have no one to talk to about all of this. My family has been a big help financially, but Im not always truthful with them about how bad it is, I don't want them to feel like I am being taken advantage of. And thats something that I struggle with as well, at times I do feel taken advantage of. I feel like Im doing everything to contribute to our survival while she sleeps all day.

I understand its an illness and that these things are beyond her control. She is working with her doctor to figure out a treatment plan, shes on 4 different meds at the moment and they aren't really helping. She keeps saying to give it time and that the meds will balance out in a bit and she'll be back to normal, but I don't even know what normal is anymore. 

But I love her, I love her so much. Its just been so hard on me lately. Theres only so much one man can do, and I constantly feel like Im not doing enough for her, because everything I do doesnt seem to help. It doesn't matter how much I do for her, I know she's still gonna spend all day in bed feeling depressed. 

Sorry for the wall of text. I've posted on here before but I ended up deleting my post. It feels so weird asking complete strangers for help, but I just need to talk to someone who I can relate to and who understands what Im going through. When I try to talk to my friends and the first thing I hear is ""oh you should just dump her"" but we have such a connection, and we love each other greatly, and Im not going to throw that away because she is sick.

In therapy and with my psychiatrist, I am asked about how my manic episodes differ from my depressed ones. Being so new to the idea that I am bipolar, I'm finding it hard to differentiate from the other. I can tell when I'm depressed and manic. I can tell the difference, but I keep getting asked about a pattern. 

I don't know though. There are no habits that I notice. I don't seem to recognize when I'm high as a kite until after the fact. And I don't keep very good track of it. So I guess my questions entail whether you notice the change in mood within it, do you see patterns, and are there tell tale signs that you are starting to shift. 

Also I am on 100mg of lamictal. If I still experience mood swings and no side effects, is it possible my medication is working but still just a low dose? Just curious as I will certainly keep taking it.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

So I've been having issues with depression since 2008 and only recently started perking up again. I'm on 120mg of Cymbalta and it seems to work quite well. I asked my doctor when several other medications weren't working if he thought I was bipolar and at the time he said no. I didn't display the classic signs of mania except increased reckless spending and a higher libido. 

Recently I've been getting hyper and my sleep schedule is completely screwed up. I've also had three episodes of rage. Once was because of disappointing news, once because I got angry at a game, and now because someone who I was close to is an asshole now and riled me up. I get angry to the point that I break things. Glasses, flashlights, anything in reach when I get angry enough. My second monitor, cell phone, and headset have all also been victims. Things I hold dear. I went to my doctor and asked again about bipolar disorder and this time he put me on a mood stabilizer. He's still not sure I'm bipolar, but he said I might be.

My question is whether or not this sounds like something that would happen with bipolar disorder and if rage is common with manic or depressive episodes. Rage to the point that is begins to cloud your judgement. To the point you throw things and yell and beat your chest.

Thanks.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

After visits being continually pushed back for nearly 2 months, I had to go to my Pdoc following a suicide attempt. He helped me out with some more meds. Mainly 3mg's daily of Klonopin which is practically the only thing that has been getting me through the day these past few weeks.  

Now after so long, I setup a followup visit with a different Psychiatrist (same practice, different doc). Basically my Pdoc took me off the original Rx of Paxil (at my request following 11 weeks of use) which was making everything worse than I went in with.  

So how exactly do I tell him certain meds are working and others haven't been in my system long enough to know the results, if any?  

I'm  near constantly thinking about how nice it would be to die or rather kill myself. I've mostly made this known to family members and they're keeping a rather close eye on me these days.  

I just don't want him to send me to an inpatient facility due to me being a harm to myself. I want something similar to the effects I get from Klonopin like being relaxed aka not on edge constantly, not doped up aka zombie and clear headedness most of the time.

Even with insurance right now my meds are about $30+ a month and around $100+ for 2 visits each to the psychiatrist and psychotherapist per month.

I was promptly prescribed a medication and basically left without any guidance because the doctor that diagnosed me was too busy with the research aspect of doctoring to really give me a plan.  All I was told was to get the medication and then seek help from my own doctor.

So I have this bottle of lamictal here and haven't opened it yet.  To be honest I'm a little scared of it, and paranoid that it'll cause a whole bunch of side effects.  I'll be seeing a psychiatrist soon, but until then I'm a little unsure.

I want to prevent the recurrences of my depression, which often times has me feeling dangerously bad, so I know that taking this medication is worth it if it can prevent me from getting that low again.  But right now I'm not in that state, so it's hard for me to look at my past and convince myself that the depression will come back if I don't take action.

The doctor that diagnosed me says right now I'm most likely in a hypomanic state right now.  And I'm inclined to agree because I go through periods of my life where I feel good and then do things that are for the most part financially reckless.  Case in point: this month I decided to buy my first house.  Right now, it feels like the right choice, but I don't know if that's the hypomania talking.  I'm scared taking the medication will make me less sure of myself.  I can't back out of my current decision to buy this house, not that I currently want to, but what if the medication brings out regret?

I don't know.  I'm pretty uncertain.  Any advice for a rookie to all of this?  Thanks.

I am on Seroquel (150 mg) since a month or so in a prevision to a bipolar disorder diagnostic. My doctor is 99% positive that I am bipolar and I tend to agree with him. I am on a list to see a psychiatrist. While this medication puts me in bed for more hours than I'd like to spend there, I guess I'm starting to feel a little better. 

That said, I still get mood swings, but they are less intense... I still stupidly waste my money on obsessions and I think about suicide from time to time. I have passing super specific special interests that will keep me awake for two or three days followed by 30ish straight hours of sleeping.

While these interests seem to be the answer to ''the meaning of life'' (using the term quite sarcastically) during these moments of very, very enjoyable hypes (writing, playing guitar, playing video games competitively, studying maths on my own, for instance, or just being creative for pretty much anything), they do not help me improve my life so far... especially considering that these moments are usually followed by me crying over every aspects of my failed existence. I'm losing... something... call it happiness, good life or whatever. All I know is I don't have it, and it's slipping between my fingers over time.

I'm 30, I've been single for the last two years, currently on work stoppage from my minimum wage job due to major depression, no diploma (a vast number of unfinished programs in the past) and losing my friends one by one because they are getting married and getting kids (I don't like kids much and they know) or because we are simply not compatible anymore. My teeth are looking great on the outside, but they are in a terrible shape and I don't have a dime to see a dentist. I can't seem to be social. I'm starting to isolate myself in my room. All my problems won't be listed here, but it seems to be an endless list and I just cannot get focus.

Focus... That magical thing that we need to achieve something.
I hope this medication will help me break the shackles of these roller coaster habits that freeze me in this never ending circle... My whole life is a succession of fails over fails over fails...

In the relationships I had I'm constantly doubting everything. Whenever I get into a new relationship with someone, friend or romantic, I hate them. I hate them dearly. I am not sure why but it makes me distant from anyone. I hate being this super friendly person and acting like the biggest bitch afterwards. Even if the ""one"" came along I would ruined everything and run away. My heart has been broken so many time and I can only blame myself for it. I am my own problem. So I stay alone. Yet, isn't it better to love and have a broken heart than never living again this feeling. I lack of faith in love, in myself. I hate this disease. The meds they gave me don't work.
 
I remember the rare time I was truly happy. Whenever I'm happy, I start realizing that I am and suddenly, it makes me sad. I'm so lost right now and I don't know where to head to. I just go out of the psych ward and I have no idea how to handle all of this. I want to start my life but I'm just this unstable, terrifying mess that only causes trouble. I don't want to hurt anyone, yet I still do. 

I really needed to vent.

Went to get her a shot then to my house and we napped, watched charlie sheen! got dinner, then watched something on tv, then I fell asleep in her arms while we started watching the  Help.

Sat we spent the day at a water park with her kids. First time seeing them since Jan and they had found out about us. It was hard to contain my excitement when her teenage daughter gave me the biggest hug ever despite my hate for being touched. It was super crowded so Faith (the gf) never left my side and we only did rides where we could ride together. I only had almost one panic attack! I didn't stay as long as they did. I was getting tired and my anxiety was getting to me. I also had to sleep by myself for the first time in 9 days :( Did not like it!

Sunday I spent the morning painting for two hours and watching The Help - I stayed awake this time! Tried to find the book Night Falls Fast but couldn't. Then took a two hour nap - pain meds knock me out.

I'm on the cusp of crying for no apparent reason, running a few miles, writing down ideas about my faith, and scratching my face off because it makes me feel better. 

A few weeks ago I went to see a psychiatrist about my own suspicion of my moods and actions and feelings and thoughts possibly being bipolar disorder. This was the first time I had seen this psychiatrist. In the past, over about 3 or 4 years, I had seen 4 psychologists, a crisis counselor, and a different psychiatrist, all having to do with depression and sucicdal thoughts. I have never been on any medication. 

Within about an hour, this new psychiatrist had diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and prescribed me lithium, to be taken in smaller dosages, (100-200 mg if I remember correctly). When I saw him, I felt like I was on the beginning of an upswing mood and I was relieved that there would be some magical pill I could take that would help me. I so immediately picked up the Lithium and took my first dose and told my mom about it. 

My mom was not happy that a doctor jumped to all of this so quickly and told me not to take any more Lithium. She took my medication away. This made me pretty upset. 

Right now I'm freaking out over everything and nothing. I have no medication. I am supposed to follow up with the psychiatrist and a different psychologist in a few weeks, but I will only be able to say that I didn't take the meds because my mom thinks we should get a second opinion. But no one seems to be moving on getting me a new appointment. 

I have no idea how to express how serious I feel about all this shit. The day after I had my meds taken away I walked out of my calculus final, turning in blank pages. I drove to the beach and screamed and cried and wanted to hit myself in the car. I tried to surf in the large swell we had, but I ending up hyperventilating and screaming and crying and felt like I was dying. 

I don't really know why I'm posting this except that I have no clue how to talk to my family about it and I don't really have anyone of my friends to talk to about it. I'm freaking out. I want to scream and cry. I want another appointment. Fucking shit. 

So this means I'll probably feel really fucking great in a few hours. I probably won't sleep tonight. and in a few days I will feel like I should just be gone and end it with my depression. 

This is great. Really. Stoked that this happens and I don't know how to talk to people.","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

Unfortunately my abuser has never left any visible marks on my body so the only way for people to know is if I say something. There is no way to physically escape my abuser because it lingers in my skull. I have finally sought help and I hope my story inspires others to do the same. 

My abuser has cost me college education, jobs, marriage, friendships and overall any semblance of a satisfying life. There are times where it barrages me with dark thoughts. It whispers in my ear how horrible I am, how I'm not good enough, how flawed I can be. It sucks the enjoyment out of everything and leaves me an empty husk. It makes me feel like a shade that hardly exists in this plane of reality. 

Sometimes it will take it further and turns my thoughts into a never ending movie of pain. And I cry, and cry and I want to escape the horror by any means necessary. Just when I've about had it, just when I'm to the point of either checking into a hospital or checking out of life I am released. It's as if all the suffering was pulling back a bowstring and I am the arrow being shot high into the sky.

Suddenly everything is FUN. Everything is AMAZING. Everything is FASCINATING. I'M fun. I'M amazing. I'M fascinating. It feels as if a tesla coil has been installed in my brain. Instead of feeling the overwhelming crush of gravity I feel like Peter Pan dancing in the clouds. It is an irreplaceable high. It's ever present, seemingly never ending and has no monetary cost. 

There IS a cost though. Those things that seemed SO interesting become less and less important. My bank account will be empty. Pissed away in the pursuit of new and fun things. The lack of sleep will catch up to me and I will spend time cleaning up after the messes I made because responsibility wasn't fun enough. Regretful thoughts start to turn darker and the cycle will begin anew. 

Over the years I've gone back and forth thinking that I might be bipolar. At the very least I know I struggle with depression. I was ashamed for thinking that I needed help and always when I was feeling my worst I would turn the corner and feel fine. I felt that all I needed to do was just wait it out and I'll be OK. That every time it would be the last time. Finally, two months ago after depression ruined another romantic relationship I sought help. Tired of constantly pushing people away when they got too close. 

I never mentioned my thoughts that I was bipolar with my therapist and convinced myself that my agony was caused by depression and anxiety. That if I could clear those up I could be that smart, funny, hardworking person that shows up from time to time. Two weeks ago I spent the better part of a week uncontrollably sobbing and was again almost to the point of either suicide or hospitalization. It took everything I had to show up for work. I work nights and the other night shift person was on vacation. I neither wanted him, nor my boss (who worked that morning) to have to come in so I went to work. I felt slightly better the next day and went to therapy. Then I felt amazing, too amazing. I was buzzing with energy and all the dark thoughts of the past few months were nowhere in sight. All forgotten. I had to drag myself into my next therapy appointment. Partially because I don't want to give the good feelings up and partially because I'm scared of what it means to be bipolar. 

I didn't beat around the bush with my therapist though I told him how I was feeling and how I thought I was bipolar. He agreed and in a couple hours I'm calling my GP to try to get on some meds. I'm still scared though. I'm scared of what the medicines will do to me. Who will ""I"" be on medication? Is the funny, fun loving, boisterous side of me going to go away forever? Is that the price I have to pay for the negative black hole to go away? Am I going to be a slave to pills for the rest of my life? 

Ultimately I want to be stable because right now I feel like any sort of future I try to build will be built on a foundation of sand. Liable to sink at any moment. That's what my life has been up to this point. No matter how solid of a house I build when I'm normal/manic it all just sinks when the depression hits and I'm tired of it. I've just got a lot of hangups I guess. I kind of understand why some people stay in abusive relationships. ""You just don't see what it's like when he's sweet to me.""

I am also not advocating any alternative medicine because I'm not claiming there is anything curative about managing without medication. I am speaking of the hardships of my decision.*

This is my throwaway account.
I can give my real account through a PM but I do not feel comfortable posting this publicly on my main.


That being said - I was diagnosed with BP around when I was 14 or 15 years old. The only medicines that worked well for my mental state had awful physical side effects for me (No boners :[, intense weight gain, brain zaps, difficulty swallowing, sleeping all the time, etc). These side effects would eventually get to me mentally too, it is difficult to feel normal when you're 16 and can't get it up. The shame and anxiety associated with these effects led me to be very sad/depressed.


I have taken the difficult road and have been trying to manage without medication since I turned 18, 6 years ago. Most of the time I can manage fairly well - people wouldn't even guess that I have BP. I try to channel my manic energy into positive things like playing drums or work/my career/being productive. Generally I have been a much happier and more successful person since I stopped medications.


Recently however I have entered a depressive state, which I can typically handle on my own. I can't quite pinpoint the cause of this one but it is just a general looming discontent feeling with some anxiety mixed in for good measure. Classic.


However, this is my first deep depressive state that I have had to deal with while with my current girlfriend of 4 years (Since we have been living together). She knows that I am diagnosed and that I choose to forego medications but I have not told her about this depressive state yet. I don't believe she understands BP very well or the extent to which I have to focus my energy to keep my mental state ""normal"". When I mention to her that I'm depressed some nights, she'll ask me why and we'll talk about it a bit before we go to bed. But to her, that is it, depression can be resolved with a quick talk and a good nights rest. It doesn't carry over for weeks to months on end for her, different factors don't cause depression to stack for her. I love her but I'm embarrassed to admit the extent of my depression, I feel pathetic.

So I mostly keep it bottled up and battle it internally. I try to use it creatively and put the emotions into art. 

My main concern is that this will start to affect our relationship. I have been quicker to anger recently and we've been bickering. She's very competitive and I'm not really, but when she is a sore winner/loser it will really rub me the wrong way and cause me to get angry (Just one example for reference). I don't like to bicker and we do always come around. I think we only have one major fight a year.

I also don't like physical contact as much in my depressive state. I am trying to consciously cuddle her each morning as I had been neglecting to do that. She'll try to kiss and hug me constantly which I just can't accept all of it. I need room to breathe. It is really hard to explain this to her as she interprets it that I don't want her - which is not the case. I have heard this described as being tactile defensive but I'm not sure if that is a symptom typically associated with BP.

The other way I am afraid that this will affect us is that my sleeping schedule is very disruptive when I'm like this. I wake up around 4AM some mornings and stay awake until sunrise while lamenting silently on life in the living room, then I go back to bed until I get up for work at 7:45AM. I also fall asleep much later than her, she likes to be in bed by 11PM or 12AM, which I agree to but I never fall asleep until 1:30 or 2AM. I just lie awake thinking.

I used to sneak away to the living room to relax and blow off some steam. I would play video games (silently), or play guitar (silently) or read so that I wouldn't disturb her or my roommates. She would usually wake up around 1AM/2AM when I did this and call me back into the bedroom upset. I haven't really been able to do these things for the past two years anyway because I have been working full time so now I just stare at the ceiling, or at the window or fiddle on my phone. I feel like I've lost my healthy(?) nighttime outlets. She thinks I am just a night owl but it's really that I'm crazy. 

Living intimately with someone is difficult enough as it is for normal people. **How do I break it to my partner that I am a mental wreck?**

I need these odd habits to manage my mental health but they disrupt her life. I love her and she really is my rock. She had progressed me so much as a person in these past 4 years.


This hurts my pride so much, I am usually really good at managing my life without medications. I have been going strong for 6 years without them.","['dobj', 'pobj', 'nsubj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

I've been a heavy drinker for the last 4 years, since my third year of college. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in January 2015 (unsure yet if it's 1 or 2, I just know I'm somewhere ""on the spectrum"", as my Pdoc says). Alcohol has, of course, always caused intense depression and made my moods worse. I continued to drink daily after I was diagnosed and given mood stabilizers. Through sheer willpower alone, I was able to quit smoking cigarettes 5 months ago. I realized this willpower could also help me quit drinking. I've started to think of alcohol as poison, and whenever I crave a drink, I tell myself ""you're craving a nice large glass of depression"". I drink a big glass of ice water, and go for a run or play tennis with my Fiance. I've allowed myself one drink a week for the past couple weeks, but last week I slipped up and had 5 drinks in one night, and was hungover the next day (my meds make me drunk faster). I felt like shit the whole week. Every time I have just one drink, I ask myself, why? Having one makes me want to have more. But also just restraining myself to one doesn't make sense either, as I don't get a buzz, and then I want more. So what's the point of having any at all?

I think by putting a person into a DSM category that was socially constructed could subconsciously reinforce certain behaviors/personality traits that wouldn't be as severe(or maybe not occur prior) w/o the labeling effect. This statement is controversial, but i am not applying this to everyone who gets labeled and some mental illnesses have been documented throughout history. People do not choose to have mental issues, i am simple throwing this theory out there. Another issue i have with the mental health system is each addition of the DSM adds more disorders that can be applied to a larger population. Prior to the new addition these people wouldn't even be labeled as having a disorder and now are a potential customer to the whole system. Also in the future much of what is currently known/theorized about mental illness and treatment will seem somewhat laughable. if you disagree w me look at the past psychological beliefs (being gay was a mental disorder in the DSM until 1973!) and psychiatric practices (insulin induced comas, chemically induced seizures, lobotomy....wtf). one positive note on current treatment would be that i think medication has helped me somewhat with my symptoms and i don;t think pharmaceutical companies and the mental health experts and system are **completely** evil or money hungry. rant complete.

Keppra, for those you don't know... leads to extreme aggression, and one of the side effects is bipolar. I know I've always been bipolar but I was always ashamed of getting a diagnosis, and when I was sexually assaulted, I was only 14. I confided in a few people, but to be frank - how can a 14 year old deal with sexual assault? This continued for quite a while. :|

Anyhow, back to the keppra. I was on 2g, and was very much having the kepprage, as keppra is very well known for. In November of last year, I was hospitalized, and my medication changed to 1g keppra, and 100mg lamictal. In December... due to an epilepsy clinic, I was hospitalized and that was the first time I had detox. Tapered off at a rapid pace. Then I was upgraded to what I am now at - 1g keppra/300 mg lamictal. 

I'm a military brat, so it's pretty hard to see my neurologist at the moment. I also have a therapist (on occasion a psychologist) and I've seen her every time I have suicidal idealations. I'm thinking about suicide even now - but I feel guilty about leaving my puppies behind, and leaving my friends behind. 

Someone who I consider a good friend helped me keep my sanity (*waves to LMB*) this past weekend, when I completely fessed up to what I was bottling up.

So yes being in healthcare, maybe it’s naïve but I think I can make an educated guess that I most likely am bipolar - probably BPII.  I've had extended family members with it so hey...  I’ve also had my share of terrible decision making in the past but it’s never affected my patient care.  The most I've had problems with at work was elation with co-workers or being hypo and getting too enthusiastic , getting into that maverick mode where I have so many suggestions on how to improve care where it doesn’t go to well with management or coworkers think I’m kissing ass.


When I come down I’ll realize what I did, I’ll realize how many unrealistic commitments I’ve committed too get super depressed and have ended up quitting in the past.  I’m not naïve, I know meds do help and so does therapy (hey I’m in healthcare) but I feel like a lot of times it’s either mishandled or just a band-aid solution.  For me a diagnosis makes me fear repercussions from licensing colleges.  I know they protect the public but it’s like a bad witch hunt with mental illness. I do think HIPPA protects me but I don’t know for sure. 


Call me irresponsible but working patients with mental illness and dealing with my own issues overtime I have come to know my limits so when I see it happen, I take days off.  I also get PRN’s from my GP, whom I’ve begged not to diagnosed me, to take me down when I feel like I'm going out of control.  I think I’m doing ok for myself.   Maybe he’s diagnosed me, and hasn’t told me?  Anyhow he knows my situation and fear of getting formally diagnosed due to stigma.

I apparently woke up not soon after. I remember wanting to die and taking 15-20 more ambien because I wanted to die. Of course I didn't die but I woke up like 10 or 12 hours later feeling super bad about it. I just feel terrible still. I told my boyfriend about it and he was super upset. He is still very worried about me. He lives very far away.

I see my therapist in a month or so and I don't know if I should tell her or not. I have been hospitalized once for attempted suicide and I really dont want to experience it again. My family and I were so upset after it happened (I was 17 at the time, I am now 21). The first time it happened, I was having a manic episode and I tried to slit my wrists at school. Luckily nobody knew it happened, I went to a Catholic school and they were all in church at the time. I drove myself to the hospital. I was only hospitalized for like 10 days. Eventually I was doing drugs and going to rehab at the same hospital almost a year later (around age 18). I did an outpatient program that my parents kinda forced me to do. I hated to do it but I loved it after the first day, it changed my life. I felt like a new person after treatment. I looked forward to going everyday and hearing everyone's stories and their support towards me.

anyways I guess I'm looking for any encouraging words. I've been on abilify and brintellix for a few months now. I went to pick them up today and it cost me 700$. I'm super discouraged. I don't even know if this medicine works super well for me yet and it costs way too much for me to afford. I dont see my psychiatrist again until April and he usually cannot see me any earlier. I'm just really upset about everything. School is so hard for me to attend or put any effort into. I need help so that i don't get put into the hospital again. 

PS : THANK YOU /r/bipolar. I may not always post but I appreciate this subreddit so much. Every now and then I see a post that sounds exactly like me and it helps me out so much. I just want to say thanks as well. I'm going through a hard time but you all inspire me so much to do better for myself and for those around me.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Well the weekend of Easter I screwed up the steak. Then Sunday (easter) my wife told me she wanted to divorce me that evening. Monday she said she wanted to take our daughter to the park after work. I was fine with I thought no big deal. Well after the park she went to a guys house. I found out because I asked her when she got home so knowing this. I asked her what she did on Saturday because she was out til 3am and the wedk before that until 2am. Well she was with him. She said she was with other people also, but her story just doesn't add up. She said he met him at a friend from works house, but in her text to him she never mentions an address I asked where the girl lived, but she said she didn't know. So I was like how did he know where to go. 

She said she hardly talked to him but I checked our phone bill and there were multiple calls to and from and texts. I was like let me see your texts then she deleted them so I couldn't then she changed the password to our bill and made it so I couldn't see it. She said she would stop talking to him and she called him right in front of me, but she was like im not allowed to talk to u and she was balling saying its not fair. Even though when I friend requested my boss on Facebook who was a female she freaked and made me remove her. 

I feel like she isnt telling me everything and not letting on to how much she cares or likes him. I can't sleep I just feel antsy my sleeping meds aren't helping. I almost moved out this weekend but I cancelled, because she said she wanted to work stuff out. But now I just feel like she is trying to hide stuff from me and every time I think about it. It just drives me crazy and I can't stop thinking about it.

I told her I would change and I would try not to be depressed as much as I have. Tonight I made a nice dinner. Then I surprised her I wanted to be romantic. So I bought rose petals and tea candles and roses and massage oil. I laid out petals to spell I love you and the candles in front of a mirror in our dresser to do the same thing. So when she looked in the mirror she would see herself and the I love you. But she was just like muah. It seemed like she didn't care.

So now its got my mind going and I cant get it to stop. I just want it to go back to what it was before where I could trust her and not have all this doubt.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I have fought a losing battle to bipolar disorder for more than 3/4 of my life.  I turned 30 this year and finally found the right medication, the right doctor, and the right treatment.

After feeling okay for several months I made an outright stupid decision, I quit taking my medication.  My personality changed very quickly, with my co workers and my long time girlfriend noticing it, but nobody said anything.  I was irritable, rude, aggressive, and every once in a while I'd be in a great mood but I was also intense when it came to arguing with people.  

My girlfriend, the love of my life, the first woman I've ever wanted a real future with, left me and I was devastated.  I fell apart quick, but it dawned on me, would my meds help? They did.  The pain in my chest was gone, the anxiety was manageable, and the pain became tolerable.

But I destroyed something so important to me.  She's with someone else now, she's happy, and I have to watch her be happy because I was undisciplined and selfish.  I don't blame her, I understand why she did what she did, and I will never forgive myself for letting this happen.  Even if I find someone who makes me happy and I eventually love they will never take her place, and I have to live with that.

Long story short, don't deviate from your plan unless your doctor agrees that you should and helps you make such a major change.  I paid a terrible price thinking I knew better.  I don't want any one else to go through such loss.  Talk to your doctor, communicate with those you love, stay the course.  Never give up.

I worked very hard on helping myself by reading books on the subject, taking care of my body, finding meaningful work and relationships, and just being aware of my moods and behaviors.

For the most part life has been good. I've managed my depression, been able to keep employment, and have quality relationships. It isn't perfect, but I am proud of the progress I've made while dealing with being bipolar. 

The only problem is that I know my mood swings won't go away, and despite my efforts I do still have to battle with depression and episodes of hypomania. I haven't put myself or others in danger, but it's something that affects me strongly and the people close to me.

The hellish process was emotionally distressing (I barely responded to most) as the side effects wrecked havoc on my academic and social life more often than not. After a while of trying, it felt hopeless and it felt like I was going to never find a solution that worked for me and that there was no point in living. I didn't want to live my life feeling out of control and dysfunctional all of the time.

I'm on a medication now that makes me feel the most mundane I have ever felt. I've been on it for about two months now and I honestly had no idea that being stable was this exciting. I used to think that medication would always be a struggle for me because I didn't think that anything could beat being manic. I really didn't know what I was missing out on.

I will think of how everything in my life is all bullshit and I am wasting my time for things that don't really matter. I will either feel entirely emotionally numb, or I will sometimes bawl my eyes out for hours. My mind will play tricks on me and I will make very silly assumptions. 

The difference between this and my average depression would be that I am more impulsive and it happens in a shorter period of time. Besides for this one time that it lasted a few months when the medication Paxil made it a lot worse for me.

Yesterday I went from feeling depressed, to a little bit 'hyper' and I ended up regretfully spending way too much on skin care products. Later throughout the day I ended up crashing and I started to feel suicidal and anxious.

After a suicide attempt her parents ""locked her away""  to a psychiatric clinic and when she came back they threw her out of the home (still beeing 16 years old). She did not speek to her parents for quiet some time. Over time things with her parents got better. 
About three years ago her father committed suicide. Until then she was ""only"" diagnosed depressiv. About 2 years ago she was diagnosed Bipolar with ultra, ultra rapid cycling. I dont know if thats right, but probably closer then just ""depression"". No Meds worked for her, she tried i guess about 15. They just made her not beeing able to think and or do any physical activty. Which would eliminate the two major things in her life her 3 horses and her Masters study.

After he Father died things became a lot worse. I could hardly imagine things could get worse before it happend. She is often extremly angry. Her anger kills any other feelings or thoughts. I makes her ""hate"" people she loves.

I work as a software developer, probably have my own mentall illnesses but i function quit well. My parents both had major depressive phases in their lives, other family members with failed suicide attempts and i had suicide thoughts in my childhood. So i can understand my wife often thinks of suicide. After 10 years full of pain and no meds working and things just getting worse when you think it can not get worse she has no hope. She says she ""wins"" over her illness if she kills herself. Beeing at a psychiatric clinic did not make things better for her but worse. Why should i ""force"" her to stay alive? 
I have no (moral) right to force her. By all means i try help her in life so she has things she loves, try to prevent problems or trouble, be there for her when her world is just black. But often i just can not help her. at all.

I feel completely emotionless and uncaring towards anything. I broke things off with my boyfriend because I felt nothing towards him anymore. And I've tried dating other people and I can create a connection with them but I don't actually feel loving or a pull to them like I used to. What happened to me?

I've noticed that recently I've had excessive food cravings. CHEESE CAKE!!!! I've been craving cheese cake for what seems like months now. It sounds silly, but the more I eat, the more food I want.


I've been staying up late and just eating. I eat dinner around 5-6 PM, then at 10-11 PM I load up another plate. Last night around midnight, I had two huge bowls of chilli.


I just had another huge bowl of chilli. My stomach very clearly feels full. But my mouth is watering at the idea of more food (Incidentally, I just asked my dad to buy me cheesecake. He said no). I am contemplating eating a bag of chocolate chips or something...

I first left my job because I was moving out of state, so I had intended to just find a new job once the move was over. Then I realized how much calmer I was without a job to go to, so I decided to take a semester off (semester without a job) to focus on school.

Then I hit a major depressive episode, so I still didn't work. Then when I came out of it, I realized how much happier and less neurotic and irritable I was without a job. I could focus on school (I was chasing pre-med at the time, so I was BUSY) and I could step back and relax whenever I needed to. It REALLY did more for me than any medications had.

And now I'm still unemployed. My SO understands to an extent, but wishes I was working. My family and his family all think I'm just a lazy piece of shit using my disorder as an excuse. I don't qualify for disability, don't have a job, but I'm still in school. Nobody understands that I feel more comfortable at school that I do my own home. Even my psychiatrist thought I was just too lazy to work.

Thinking about finding a job now causes so much anxiety and it triggers mini depressive episodes in me. I do feel like a loser, but I know deep down that it's better this way.

And honestly, (this will sound like excuses) it is a little harder for me to find a job right now. My SO works 50+ hours a week and we share a car. We're both in school. We don't live in a public transit-friendly area. It's very, very rare that I have my car available to me. Add to that the fact that there are VERY FEW companies that will work around your schedule out here. (Anyone know of any work-from-home jobs requiring little experience?) 

I do some freelance stuff once in a while, but I make so little money that I may as well not waste my time.

I just find it weird that I'm still in school, working towards a career of some sort, but I can't even work now.

I apparently suffer from Bipolar 2 disorder. That's not an official diagnosis, but my therapist of 2 years is confident about it and the last pdoc I saw strongly suspected it. If that is the case (I'll be seeing a new psychiatrist in a couple weeks; we'll see) then it sure as hell does explain a lot.

Things have become markedly unstable for me recently. My most recent depressive spell was truly deep and dark, full of suicidal ideation and handily worse than any of its predecessors. The euphoric hypomania has been replaced with rage and anxiety and crawling skin.

 Self-medication has become dangerous and exhausting for me (and ineffective), but it's all I know as far as dealing with this. I'm tired of my rotating arsenal of recreational drugs (I have managed to quit drinking though; alcohol is too destabilizing for me). There are only a few psych meds that don't scare me to death, and in those cases I'd be just as scared of the possibility that those drugs wouldn't work. 

I've tried my best to accept my situation, but all I want is to be truly healthy. I would hate to regain half of the considerable weight that I busted ass to lose. I don't want to compound my already extant sexual frustration with ED, etc. I've done so much work to try and boost my self-esteem and body image and my shot at a stable, healthy life. I want more than anything to not feel like a sad-sack misfit anymore, and I guess what I'm saying is: I'm scared that I'm gonna feel that way forever, meds or not.","['nsubj', 'advmod']",1,neu_vader

It doesn't make sense. This drug has been on the market for only 15 years I feel like it might cause early onset dementia or something equally undesirable.

On zyprexa I feel boring, depressed, and without ambition.  I'm currently in university taking 7 credits and struggling. I feel as if zyprexa is affecting my memory and my motivation. People talk about what the want to do/ where they want to be in five years and I see myself just scraping by. I do have some interest in film and writing but it seems as if on anti psychotics, those things will be nothing but a hobby.

I told my psychiatrist about my concerns but she rebuffed me. She said that all the medications have side effects, particularly lithium which damages the kidneys ability to concentrate urine over time.

I was dating this girl for almost 3 months. Things were awesome. We connected on so many different things, I made sure to treat her amazingly, encourage her, comfort her, all the things that make for a great emotional connection in a relationship. Her usual reciprocation was physical; I'd say I missed her and she say ""awww"" and go in for a quick make out session. She didn't verbally parrot every compliment I made to her, but the things she said to me still meant a lot.

We have a great time connecting, come up with a cute little game of keeping track of all the new places we'd kissed, and spend an amazing valentine's day together that basically ended with us making out in public all over the city for a solid hour. A little bit more than a week later, we have sex for the first time. Not the most amazing, but I'm 4 1/2 months out of practice, and it's our first time so I didn't imagine we'd be completely in tune with each other's bodies to make it be amazing.

So, from there, we continue to date. We go out and have fun, but when I ask her to come home with me or go back to her place she turns down the offer, usually because she's tired. I always respect this and don't act too pushy or sexually assertive in response to this, but the third time she says it I playfully ask why. After trying to get it out of her for a while, she feels we rushed the first time and that she has been trying to take things slow. But she promises ""soon"", to which I reply that she doesn't have to promise me things like that.

From there, she actively brings me more into her life. I meet her friends, twice, she meets mine, and we go dancing together and she teaches me how to swing dance. Mind you, every suggestion other than her meeting my friends was her idea entirely, she invited me out to do these things. Things go amazing, but on the night of swing dancing, I tell her that I want to come more often. She panics and scrambles for reasons, but I cut her off and tell her I understand her hesitation to try to comfort her as she was clearly grasping for straws and trying not to offend me. A bit later on she still seems upset, so I go in to comfort her and give her a kiss, but she pulls away. Later on that night she apologizes for that, saying she was still just a bit freaked out, but make the argument that she didn't want me there every day because we both need our own separate things to do. To include myself in every aspect of her life so soon is a bit much, an argument that I completely agree with. We end things by making out and then parting ways since its a weekday and plan to see each other during the weekend.

I'm rambling a bit now, so I will do my best to be concise. Friday I call her to confirm plans, and she drops the bomb out of the blue that she doesn't want to date anymore. Flabbergasted, I ask why, things were going really well, she didn't indicate anything and never talked about anything negative. Her reasoning is thus:

She realized she wasn't just as in to me as she thought, mostly brought on by: The first time we had sex wasn't great. In fact, she described it as being terrible. She is apparently a very sexual person, so this was important. She told me that she put up the going slow barriers due to the first time being bad, and that she felt wouldn't have done so if it was better.

Needless to say, I'm terribly hurt. I try to end things amicably, but I tell her I can't stay friends because I don't want to see her with other people.

But then, on the subway yesterday, it hits me. 3 weeks in she told me that she was diagnosed bi-polar, manic type. Having studied psychology I know what this is. I comfort her right then and there and tell her I care about her too much to let something like that ruin what we had so far.

I'm the first person she's ever had to divulge that too, and as far as I know, the first person she's had sex with since she started taking her medications. The thing is, the side effect of the type of medications she was taking IS decreased sexual satisfaction. It can be in the form of not getting any pleasure through sex, not feelings as strong of a sexual drive, and not feeling as attracted to someone.

And so now... I'm scared that her meds were the reason she may have ended things, and I want to talk to her about it. Not just to try and patch things up, and not just to get myself some closure (which I REALLY want after this revelation), but to also see if she herself knows this. If she doesn't, then it may save her a lot of heartbreak and frustration in the future, both on her part and the guys she dates.

Redditors, I don't know what to do. I want to talk to her about this, but I'm scared. Really really scared.

TL;DR: My bi-polar girlfriend/girl I was dating dumped me due to bad sex our first time and not a strong sexual desire for me, both extremely common side effects of the medication she was on. I want to talk to her about this.

Then it was like I was being choked. After it was done, I started shivering really bad, and when I closed my eyes I saw a little girls leg, which was very pale and looked dead. I felt dizzy when I opened my eyes, and since it had never happened to me before, I was just really messed up. It was like I was possessed, because I had no control of my body when it happened.

I was always exceedingly rational, and was confident, outgoing. I didn't know I was bipolar, and while I made a lot of stupid decisions that now are obviously because of the disorder, but I pretty well had it together.

Last summer I came under massive stress. Then I stopped sleeping and eating, then I had my first psychotic break. I was driving across the state at the time and had these visions of wars, government survellience, God, that my life was a video game I'd either won or lost...all kinds of weird things. I wound up out of gas and disoriented on the side of the interstate and the cops picked me up and brought me to the hospital. More weird stuff happened there, like all the other patients were acting in concert as some religious play, but I ignored that, got some help and got home. That was how I found out I was bipolar.

After that they put me on respiderol, and I had another weird experience a few weeks later, but nothing near as bad as the first time. After that, though, the drugs fucked me and kept me awake for about 10 days with only an hour or two of sleep a night. 

This time I had a catastrophic break. I got super paranoid and thought my community was running me out of town, that my family was abandoning me, that my wife was possessed by demons. When I tried to flee my house my family called the cops and they took me to the hospital. I thought I had died and the hospital was hell and the nurses and patients were demons come to torture me. Any moment the walls were going to dissolve and my eternal torment would begin. Then later I thought the hospital was a gas chamber, or a satanic cult, or a prison I'd never leave, or a feeding ground for aliens. Or perhaps a chance at heavenly salvation that I missed out on over and over again because my fears prevented me from guessing the right answer in each situational ""test."" I was in the hospital for ten days until they could get my meds worked out.

Now I'm a superstitious bundle of nerves, jumping at my own shadow. I'm depressed and wind up in this existential despair where nothing makes sense anymore. I wonder if I died that day on the interstate. Creamed by a truck and I never even knew it, and now I'm in...heck? I watch TV or listen to the radio and I'm always scared there'll be some kind of hidden message that'll jump out at me. I get scared something there got a hold of my soul. I just feel scarred, like I'll never be ""me"" again. Being on drugs that alter my moods doesn't help me feel ""normal"" much either.

Has anyone else experienced this? Did you ever feel better? How long did it take? Reality feels ""fake"" and like it doesn't matter, and that's depressing and frightening.

So, if you have any tips on deciding whether it's the illness making life seem pointless  (&amp;amp; therefore making med adjustment possibly beneficial) vs. a personal lack of  whatever (yes, I know I should exercise) contributing to it, I'd really appreciate hearing them.

anyways. so my ex girlfriend texted me, called, emailed me, texted work phone, emailed work email, and called worked cell. at first i wasn't go to respond. then i wanted to tell her to go to hell. then i did on text. then... i didn't stop writing. i told her that she needs to lay off the adderall because its making her paranoid. then i called her. still don't know why. i was concerned about her because of the paranoid question she wanted to ask. i started to go on and on of how shitty my life was because of her. she said it was the other way around. and for some reason i believed her....

so then i felt an alter switch. one that felt very familiar, and not been around for a while. took me awhile to realize it was my ""courtmanship"" semi-male alter. after a long conversation the mean part of me took over and wanted to get her away. that mean alter resided after. and now i'm stuck with this alter i invented for her. the one that uses my female desires as a cheat sheet to get women. i'm kinda stuck with him now. 

...and i know this cycle. its happened before. i court her, feel nothing in return because my female desires start to filter in. she doesn't like treating me that way. i hate being treated like a man. i start to realize i won't be treated as a girl and that causes the angry alter. i get borderline violent. she tries to block me from leaving, punch the wall or something nearby and shove her out of the way. next weekend, rinse and repeat. for about 1 a month. eventually i learn it won't stop. 

Why? because i get lonely. but i hate that alter she bring out of me. she is a huge trigger for that alter. and now i'm stuck in him after the phone call. and i know what happens, he will desire her and its a bad cycle... has happened 3 times now. 

earlier today i had a massive mixed episode. racing thoughts and depressed as hell. i was crying for like an hour. and that story above happened. the nurse in me wanted to help her, then i wanted to tell her how she ruined my life, she said i was delusional, trigger the suave alter and realized what was going on and got mad and hung up. 

now i have this feeling release because i got to cry, i was way overboard for that. then the anger towards her is (temporary) gone. so some of the dissociation is gone... but with the wrong alter!!!!!

and here is the thing, last night i kinda had a pretty hot and heavy make out session with this guy that i really shouldn't have (...*cough*married*cough*) but he came on to me. and when he answered my female desires, i was on cloud 9. i haven't had that feeling in well over 2 years. when i was with my ex, it wasn't really like that. b/c she wanted me ""to be the guy"" to speak. which depresses the hell out of me. and he triggered the extremely feminine alter. the one i've missed for so long. i had her for like 3 days till right now. 

so i'm thinking that having mixed episodes was a huge factor in the alter switching. the desperation of depression, and the desire for some affection. that got the best of me with the guy. oh i miss that... and i could tell he was enjoying it as well... which made me feel even more desirable. then 10 minutes later i felt terrible. i got caught up in something i should not have. but i think most of us know what i'm talking about. 

anyways. mixed episodes suck... really bad. especially when i was down. my thoughts were pretty bad. the worse i've had in months. i won't go into detail. 

i'm getting worried. i'm switching alters a bit more than usual. and they all act differently on episodes. its like having a third dimension on my mood chart :P

i also had quite a bit more paranoia... but i cut far back on my adderall intake. and i felt less far away. i'm front row to the movie. but its the wrong alter!! this is the one that gets me into a mess that ends badly. i think its the mixed state with crying relief, and false sense of closure. i think a good cuddle with my panda will bring her back. i wish i could use names, but i'm scared of people making connection eventually to this account. 

anywho.. that was my day. i probably should just have a journal. but i like comments. because sometimes i get a little bit of help... when i remember writing them!! i was going to respond to a post, as i started to write it, i looked down and saw i already had. derp!!

oh yeah. my day for work was SUPER stressful. that was another trigger. to the point i wanted ot just disappear from work for the rest of the weekend. but i don't anymore. i wanna finish and be the hero. or is that heroine? 

oh, and if anyone wants to know my bisexual preference. i LOVE the foreplay with women. its so soft and gentle and... yeah. i'll stop there. with men, i like the slight aggressiveness. that feeling of ""he wants me so much"". that will put a smile on my face. and i know the nighttime meds are kicking in when i talk about something like that :P

The things in there that my 'friends' had put, the things omitted by my supervisor who was supposed to do whatever she could to help me.  It hurt me...really bad.

I talked to my boyfriend about this and told him how it honestly just made me feel jaded.  No one you work with is your friend.  Make a note of every single interaction, even if it seems minuet.

I want to get away.  I want to run away. (Doesn't that sound like some kind of old song? Old meaning 90's 00's?) I want to pick up and leave.  I know I can't. I know I have no way to support myself. I know if I go where I want to go...I'll end up homeless.  And medicationless.  That's not going to help anything/anyone.

FYI: Not everyone will have the same experience on any of these medications this information applies to my individual case only although these exact symptoms have been documented elsewhere. Do your own research before willingly accepting any prescriptions for psychotropic, neuroleptic, antipsychotics medications (etc.) Also important is prior drug usage history this can and does have an impact on outcomes with said medications.

I'm sharing this only for the purposes of providing information *AND FAIR WARNING* to others seeking information concerning certain medications prescribed to persons diagnosed with Bipolar II (also maybe Bipolar I but I have no experience on that subject). I will include prior drug usage history as this may be useful for some. I am not attempting to 'rank' myself in any fashion and am not particularly proud of my prior substance usage history (however benign).

Background.

I have never suffered any serious physical medical related symptoms (except for migraine headaches) and have been in excellent shape and health throughout the majority of my life. I was an active and enthusiastic snowboarder for 15 years, participated in cross-fit type training regimes, and ran 5 miles daily or 3 times a week depending on schedule. My metabolism was 'perfect' I only ate when I was hungry and had a specific taste for healthy foods thus had no problem controlling weight and other health factors. My nominal resting blood pressure measurements prior to psychological intervention was 120/70. This was the case even during alcoholic period although peaking at times 135/80. Subsequent to psychological intervention my nominal resting blood pressure is 155/90 and am now considered at high risk for heart attack and stroke. My diet has not changed but I am completely unable to exercise due to permanent side effects of the medications covered herein. I used to love life even during major depression and 'using events' and I've had some serious problems in the past but was always able to manage with a smile and move forward while working to make myself better every day. Now I struggle every day to get out of bed and drive to work without plowing my car into a concrete overpass.

** These changes occurred within the period of approx 12-16 months and have been found not attributed to any normal physical/aging process - but substance abuse history must be considered although I was considered in perfect physical health (physically 5-10 years younger than age) immediately before psychological intervention and was not using any substances **

Most observations were confirm via 3rd parties who witnessed behavior directly.

I will skip issues with antidepressants (especially SSRI's) as it is well known that these medications are largely unsuitable for those diagnosed with Bipolar II (possibly also Bipolar I - I have no experience).

All recreational drugs including alcohol and tobacco were completely cessated prior to treatment with mood stabilizers.


Lamotrigine (titrated)
==============

Dosage unknown. In combination with Lithium.

Troubles began after prescription for Lamotrigine to control mood. Initial results were good with marked weight loss and stabilization of mood. Sudden increase in irritability and aggression was observed followed by sensitivity to light and sound in particular the sound of other people eating or drinking (misophonia). Triggers for Misophonia would result in sudden increase in anxiety, aggression and a marked loss of attention. Often I would need to leave the room immediately to control aggression and this would occur WHILE AT WORKPLACE. Eventual result was involuntary hospitalization (see below).

Lithium Carbonate (titrated)
==================

Dosage: 900mg max daily (max dosage reached subsequent to hospitalization)

Lithium seemed to work initially quite well but within 4-6 months problems occurred. 

Side Effects:

* First noticeable side effect was uncontrollable hand shaking/tremors. 
* Extremely rapid weight gain approx 30% body weight (165lbs =&gt; 210lbs) in a 3 month period. 
* Large red uncontrollable pimples appeared on face and all over back and arms (pimples disappeared after lithium cessation leaving large unsightly scars). Doctors said it was 'just acne' and I shouldn't worry about such things.
* Marked memory loss was then observed. Doctors explained this was a normal result of aging.
* Undiagnosed liver and kidney problems manifesting as bloody urine, pale stools, and generalized abdominal pain. Liver function blood tests always were nominal or marginal. 
* Sudden onset of suicidal thinking and ideation.

I *continually* complained of noticeable and debilitating memory problems to doctors and was seemingly dismissed at all times (over a 6 month period). Eventually they relented and I was scheduled for a 6 hour neuropsychological evaluation. Results showed extremely high IQ, pattern recognition, mathematical skills, excellent language *comprehension*, but marked malfunction of short term memory not age related and noted as extremely concerning (not related to dementia). Doctors cheerfully wished to continue Lithium treatment but I refused and titrated down dosage over a 1 month period.

Outcome: Poor / Life-Threatening - 

* Significant and severe withdrawal symptoms resulting in deep trance-like sleep, disconnection from reality, hallucinations, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of speech, loss of hearing, visual disruptions (focused areas crawling, warping, morphing, melting). 
* Occasional loss of breathing reflex similar to sleep apnea - I was always able to recover.
* Large permanent unsightly scars on face, back and arms due to 'acne'.
* Thyroid malfunction resulting in Hypothyroidism and continued uncontrollable weight gain even with diet and exercise.
* Permanent memory loss. Most of my memory before age 30 is foggy and before age 10 is mostly gone with a few notable exceptions that are extremely lucid.
* Permanent vision damage (halos around bright objects and problems focusing).
* Permanent partial loss of feeling in external limbs (hands, feet). 
* Permanent damage/impact to areas of brain handling word recollection and spelling (words are always on the tip of my tongue and I now rely on online dictionaries, thesaurus etc.) 
* Liver damage resulting in Fatty liver and generalized pain. 
* Occasional bloody urine.
* Seemingly Permanent partial loss of connection to reality / feeling of disassociation has not abated in 6 months.
* Significant loss of income due to long term medical leave caused by side-effects and withdrawal symptoms (NOT COVERED BY DISABILITY).
* Significant negative impact on reputation due to work absences and strange behavior.
* Permanent loss of ability to remember routes e.g. driving to work I need to use a GPS every day even after 2 years at the same office only 15 miles away.
* Continued suicidal thinking and ideation.

Topomax/Topiramate (titrated) - Subsequent to hospitalization
====================================

Dosage: 100mg max daily

While reducing lithium dosage I spoke with my doctor about this medication as I had researched and found some intriguing Initial results for mood stabilization with the benefit of possible weight loss (or at least control of weight gain). Initial side-effects were extremely rapid and uncontrollable even at the lowest dosage (25mg daily). 

Side effects included:

* Inability to wake in the morning even with alarm set every half hour from 7am onwards - often I would sleep in 4 hours or more during work days.
* Sudden mental changes including perception of reality, paranoia, aggression, extreme uncontrollable anxiety.
* Sudden rapid weight gain 15 lbs in 7 days while appetite crashed (could be water weight but is still present 1 month later).
* Sudden uncontrollable abdominal pain.
* Chronic uncontrollable pain in lower back on the spine.
* Bloody urine, pale stools.
* Intense headaches and eye pain.
* Sudden change in vision noticeably long-distance vision rapidly deteriorated and ability to refocus dramatically reduced. Without visual aids I am now considered legally blind. 
* Yellowing of skin around eyes, nose and mouth.
* Hair falling out in clumps.
* Sudden onset of disassociation from reality occurring at any time without warning including while driving and in the work place.
* Visual and auditory hallucinations (minor).
* Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting.
* Waking to the feeling my entire body is sunburned.
* Feeling overheated without fever yet temperature is actually below normal (95 degrees).
* Complete loss of appetite.
* Lack of thirst response although badly dehydrated and very strong foul smelling urine.
* Loss of income due to medical leave to handle side effects / eventual withdrawal symptoms.
* Brittle nails, dry skin.
* Sore throat and problems swallowing.
* Complete loss of libido.
* Loss of interest in all activities.
* Suicidal thinking and ideation.
* Sudden dangerous increase in blood pressure.

Side effects continued to worsen dramatically - I called my doctors and it was 'suggested' I slowly titrate down the dose over a 1 month period. During the first few days of dosage reduction the side effects continued to increase and became unmanageable. I would find myself completely unaware of where I was or how I got there. People would speak to me and I had no idea what they were saying or what we were talking about. My hair continued to fall out in clumps and I was so hot I was sweating profusely yet my temperature continued to show as below normal. I was massively dehydrated yet had no thirst response. I pushed everyone around me away and sunk into the depths of my own twisted warped reality and it terrified me to death. During this time I continued to drive to work because I had no access to disability and am the sole income provider. This was in incredible stupid and dangerous decision I could have easily killed myself or worse some other innocent person(s) do NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION LIGHTLY it can grossly affect your own judgement of your capacity to function.

Finally I decided to take matters into my own hands and immediately stopped taking the medication and waited for the eventual withdrawal symptoms to arrive - and they did within 24 hours:

Outcome: Unable to even begin to rate - it is *possible* (speculation!) I was near death at some times especially during periods were breathing stopped and with low body temperature. There is some known side-effect related to highly acidic blood but I don't have much information on this or if I was showing symptoms. I was not under care of any doctor during this time indeed they had instructed me to continue taking the medication. Some symptoms can be collaborated via 3rd parties some I am positive occurred and others may simply be artifacts of some deep terrible psychosis I have no real way to know. 

* Complete loss of connection to reality.
* Uncontrollable vomiting and diarrhea.
* Immediate loss of income due to inability to think/walk/drive/etc.
* Often existing in multiple states of reality moving back and forth between desperately attempting to regain control.
* Continued weight increase with complete loss of appetite (down to 300 calories per day).
* Sustained high blood pressure.
* Coma like states exhibiting pinpoint pupils and unresponsive.
* Feeling of extreme heat yet sweating stopped completely. Temperature continued to show as below normal.
* Bloody urine, pale stools.
* Abdominal pain.
* Severe headaches and eye pain.
* Severe insomnia only treatable with higher doses of medication (Quetiapine which I was also desperately trying to reduce at the time).
* Paranoia and concoction of non-fictional events that I believed to be true but had no explanation as to why.
* Suicidal thinking and ideation.
* Strange effect were everything speeds up - like when watching television the words go really fast and everything is just moving really fast like 500 mph.
* Many more... some I can't even remember there are many days that simply do not exist in my timeline of history.

I was taking Topiramate (Topomax) for barely 3 weeks and the withdrawal symptoms were horrifying. i was completely fucked up worse than any other substance I have attempted to withdraw from (granted I have never had the pleasure of experiencing the horror that is heroin withdrawal). 

I am now at the point I can reliable determine what is reality from what is not. At this point I am taking no mood-stabilizers for my 'Bipolar II' but honestly feel so very much better physically it is like a huge relief. Mentally of course I am struggling but I will work with the doctors to find some alternative treatment - at this point I have lost all faith in these medications and fear for my life. 

Indeed what is most troubling is the fear I am feeling for my own life, yet I am now convinced I will indeed kill myself at some point in the future. I don't know why that is the case the suicidal thoughts have only manifested during the treatment with Lithium and Topiramate but I am convinced I will do so. It is not a matter of thinking about suicide or wanting to do so it's more like I am constantly making sure I am not putting myself in a position where something might happen. 

It is as if something else inside me has awakened (or was created?) and is attempting to wrestle control away in order to end my life. It is as if all the trauma I have experienced over the past year has been experienced at an even greater level by some other deep, dark, insidious part of myself that is slowly and methodically attempting to gain control. I intend to fight this horrible thing with all my being but it seems everyday I lose a little ground. It is deeply troubling and no one seems to see the connection between what is happening to me now and the awful experience with mood-stabilizing medications (at least those I tried - I cannot speak for all of them).

So, in conclusion (finally, I shut the fuck up):

I was once a troubled and slightly (maybe more so) fucked up individual who was physically healthy and loved life to the fullest. I loved to exercise and build insane high voltage experiments, program video games, chase thunderstorms and read books on extreme physics &amp; mathematics that I barely understood - but I ate it all up regardless. My friends would all describe me as eccentric, brilliant, crazy, full of life, 'one of a kind', generous, caring, completely nuts, and above all an imperfect sheer force of life who overcame many obstacles always to rise up and start again (to be clear most of this was after I experimented with LSD it did have a huge impact on my life and my ability to socialize and gain true friends I could trust - maybe not one of the best decisions of my life and I don't condone such usage. In full disclosure I do think it should be removed from schedule I and studied intensely alongside MDMA, Cannabis and other substances).

Then at one point I had a break down. This was mostly due to insane work stress and troubles at home - normally I would simply drink but that was no longer an option for me. Whatever the cause I ended up with a 'diagnosis' of Bipolar II and was placed on certain medications to 'stabilize my mood' for the benefit of myself (and likely those around me although I was never considered a true threat to others at any time before then). These medications work for a vast majority of people but for some, and for me in particular the result has been catastrophic. My life has been effectively destroyed in the period of 16 short months. My mind has been scrambled to the point that I don't even know who I was before - I look through the vast collection of books I collected on various topics and honestly don't understand most of them anymore. The act of reading itself has become so difficult because the words tend to move around and letters get scrambled. I've gained vast quantities of weight and people don't even recognize me - my hair is falling out and I'm partially blind. I have problems hearing and decoding words (not the sounds - the actual words). I'm in massive debt due to medical bills (America, fuck yeah) for treatment that has done nothing but severely damage me both mentally and physically. My reputation at work has been ruined and I'm considered 'unreliable' and no longer an authority in my field as I once was. I honestly think they still keep me on staff and pay me out of sheer sympathy or fear of legal repercussions.

To put it bluntly, these medications almost killed me - they ended the life I once had and left me with a shattered shell of something I don't even recognize. Even though they didn't succeed directly in ending my life the outcome will be the same - I will eventually kill myself and I have no fucking clue why. 

Somewhere in the distance, the should of tiny violins can be heard playing.

He says his anxiety makes his bladder hurt so he doesn't want to have sex. He still masturbates. When we do have sex, he doesn't touch me at all, doesn't participate in foreplay, and usually won't penetrate me for more than a minute or two, if at all - he wants his penis to be touched but not by my genitals, and he wants to be fucked anally. So ""sex"" is generally me spending an hour or so pleasuring him while he lays back like a dead fish and then afterwards me begging him to touch my breasts a little while I masturbate. I cater to all his fetishes, I do disgusting things that make me sick to try to get him to reciprocate but he won't. I can't remember when he last touched my vagina of his own volition.  I can't remember the last time I was made love to. Its just me roleplaying dick girl dominatrix and having to use both hands to satisfy him so that I can't even touch myself. I'm crawling out of my skin I'm so horny and our relationship is good, I want to be with him forever, but I feel so ugly and gross and unloveable and I have all of this sexual manic energy burning me up making me tense and angry all the time. I want to cheat on him but I'm sick at the idea of anyone else in the world touching me and I hate myself for even having those thoughts. 

I changed my body to make him happier. When we met I was extremely slim and I loved my body but he would occasionally lament not knowing me when I had C-cups so after half a year of near abstinence I started putting butter and coconut oil in my coffee every morning to gain about 15 pounds. Now I have large breasts that hurt all the time and none of my clothes fit me and he tells me how much better my breasts look all the time but he still won't touch them. 

When I try to discuss it with him, he just says he wants to hurt himself and it feels so bad to be put on trial for his libido, no matter how nicely I try to present it. He's in therapy but frequently skips because he doesn't think he needs it anymore. 

I'm an incredibly sexual person. Hypersexuality is my most constant symptom. I want to illustrate sex-positive porn for a living but I can't produce work when thinking about sex just makes me frustrated and angry.  I don't know what to do but lie in bed and cry and scream and claw at my skin and wish someone would touch me. I feel so alone. I think I'm going to ask my doctor for medication to make my sex drive go away, if such a thing exists.

My pdoc mentioned this as a possibility but didn't tell me anything definitive. I've been researching and the 'mania' side of it doesn't seem to fit me at all. However, after researching hypomania, it fits almost perfectly. I think I have the rapid firing aspect of it though as these mood swings sometimes happen intradaily, but usually happen from day to day, or every few days. I also have social anxiety or just poor psychosocial interactions that mainly occur during the depressive stage (although they carry over to a lesser extent during the hypomanic days). 

Anyway, because of this social anxiety or possibly vice versa, I stutter. It's not so much of a t-t-t-today junior type of stuttering, it's more like stumbling over my words and messing them up, having to stop and start over a lot of the time. I feel like it's gotten worse over the last year but I am so god damn sick of it. I'm feeling more and more that I won't be able to control my social anxiety and that is almost literally the only thing I want to fix. I can handle the bipolar, at least make it manageable, if I could just be normal socially. I realize that's harder than it sounds but I'm trying to take this step by step so I don't go crazy. I want to get my stuttering under control since it's a big day-to-day problem. Sorry for the novel, but my question is: What is the best course of treatment? I'd like to avoid going to a speech therapist as I feel like I should be able to do this on my own. Do certain bipolar meds help? Are there any websites I can read up on or that can give me information or make-shift speech therapy? Thanks for the answers in advance.

TL;DR: Any suggestions on how to stop stumbling over my words (or stuttering) and slow down my talking speed?",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I basically called my friend a bitch and a cheating cunt last night while drunk (the most I've ever been). It was supposed to be a stress-free night that ended with both sides raging at each other and her crying. Goddammit. 

I was incredibly stupid in my reasoning for feeling that way. Something little set me off and I went from happy-go-lucky, to depressed, to angry, back to depressed, then back angry before I let her have it. I can't seem to be happy. I can't seem to stop myself from taking out my hate for myself on others, especially the ones I love. I excel at pushing people away. Now I might lose another friend who's been nothing but helpful and understanding because I made a stupid decision and let something little and stupid get to me. I will never get that drunk again.

I want to be the best friend I can be for this girl, because she's been the same for me, but I'm my own worst enemy in this endeavor, and I have no idea why other than I hate myself. I hate the fact that I feel like a failure. I hate the fact that I can't seem to stand up for myself or be assertive. I hate the fact that when I do, it ends up hurting people and pushing them away. I hate the fact that my life is a big steaming pile of shit. I hate the fact that I have the emotional maturity of a five year old. I hate the fact that I can't maintain any meaningful relationship. I hate the fact that I never learned to control myself. I hate the fact that I feel like I'm set in my ways. I hate the fact that life has made me bitter. I hate the fact that I just might end up like my dad: bitter, stuck in a job I hate, and just settling for what I can get. I hate the fact that every time I try to make a change, I can't seem to keep that change going. I hate the fact that if I do have change, it's almost immediately taken away from me by my own hand or by circumstance. I hate the fact that I seem to be subconsciously seeking approval, love, and affection in all the wrong places. I hate that I seek sympathy instead of actually changing anything. Finally, I hate the fact that I hate myself.

On top of all that, my meds keep me from really releasing any emotion. I'm deadpan, and I know I really need to cry or something. I feel like the biggest pile of shit because of what I did, but I can't really feel it. It's frustrating.

I just got out of a very mutually abusive relationship. We both have bipolar disorder and the relationship was very sick. She cheated on me, a lot, and I verbally abused her and threatened suicide, a lot, to get her to stay.

Now that I'm without her, I know I'm happier, and I've never felt more free. But, I still have bipolar disorder and a slew of anxiety problems. She was the only one who pushed me to be who I am (I'm transgender, and I'm a theater major). She was successfully pushing me to get a therapist, and she is continuing to help out with that. But, therein lies the problem. Every time I see her, I'm reminded of how sick we both are. We haven't changed in the least in the few weeks we've been single, and I know for a fact that she is going to seriously fuck up the guy she is dating. Every time I see her, I'm also reminded of the fact that she was the only person who has ever found me attractive the way I am, a non-binary transgender man. I feel like no one else will ever find me attractive physically and I know no one is ever going to be able to handle my mental problems.
Again, she's trying to push me to get into a therapist, and she isn't here very often, but whenever I talk to her, I break the fuck down. It gets 10 times worse every time, too. Today I broke down so bad I couldn't even articulate a complete sentence when I was talking to her. The words wouldn't come to my brain, let alone my mouth. I fear that if I keep talking to her, I'm going to lose my mind, almost literally. But I have no one else. My mom is more depressed than I am, my brother is too young, my sister lives too far away (and has a lot of her own problems), and I don't have any friends that I can trust with this at all.

I don't know what's logical at all anymore, but I know I'm going to keep letting it happen. Maybe it'll somehow get better. I can't even eat. I only sleep because my meds make me. But, I'm going to at least try to do my homework tonight. I'm passing all of my classes so far, so I at least have that going well in my life.

After reading a bunch of your posts, I'm starting to realize that I vacillate between the two poles pretty rapidly.  I'm medicated, but the changes can be a week-to-week change.  

I have to admit that if I didn't run my own relatively successful business, I don't know what would be going on right now.  My ups and mids are apparently great enough that my staff just gives me the time and space I need during the lows.  I know I'm lucky there.

I'm just trying to figure out if that's a coping mechanism I came up with in years gone by before I was diagnosed and, ultimately, how healthy that is...

So we have a very small alcoholics anonymous group and everything was going fine for the first 30 minutes when a local member (comes around often) was *not* his usual self. 

When it was time to share he started reading our literature in basically gibberish, omitting the first letters because ""there was some secret meaning behind it"". He took our group ""hostage"" (not literally) shouting that there's no leaders in AA I can say what I want freedom of speech. I stepped out for a smoke to think because the confrontation he was putting off had him shaking nervously which in turn made me really nervous. I was wondering if this guy was going to flip the hell out right here and now because he was really undone.When I got up to leave this somewhat aggravated him because he said okay I'll stop reading but I went out anyway sensing the extreme nervousness he was giving off I mean he was literally shaking with adrenaline. 

I already knew what was up with him but he had mentioned once before that he ""wasn't"" bipolar anymore thanks to AA. Well this man was manic as can be and I was the only one who knew it. Everyone else just thought he was being a dick. I decided to try to talk to him in private to ask him if he's alright. When I come back in he's coming out of the bathroom and yelling at the group not to talk shit behind his back. Mind you the group is just a few girls and 2 old folks.

I being a frekin idiot and also bipolar asked if I could talk with him and we went outside for a smoke. I tried to relate to him to tell him ""you know, I've been put away 7 times for bp... are you alright..."" but he just insisted that he wanted to heal me with prayer and going on about grandiose things like that he was a multimillionaire who travels the world healing people... 

Well, our meeting was ruined everyone left early. After telling him that I don't want to hold his hand and let him pray over me he called me a sinner and told me I'm damned then disappeared into the city night. We talked back and forth more than I mentioned here but he absolutely would not let me say what he knew I was trying to say which is ""wtf man where are your meds""

As someone diagnosed with bipolar I thought I'd be able to have a chance at helping him. I mean this guy needs to be seen by doctors asap. Not the case. He was very pissed that I was trying to tell him that I am bipolar that I recognize his symptoms and for asking him if he was gonna be safe. I'm mostly getting this off my chest. Most people would be glad to stay the hell away from someone like that but I know he's not being a dick that he is very sick. He's always been a nice guy at meetings. 

What should I have done? Should I have called the police and gotten him 5150'd? We don't have any protocol for this kind of thing happening at our group and I was totally unprepared for handling a extremely manic man. His nervousness and agitation was enough to flip the danger switch off in my head and I felt that yeah this man could be a danger all the while trying to talk to him. I'm just coming down from being in such a fight or flight mode.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Ok, so I've been through quite a lot in my life, including my father's sporadic physical and emotional abuse from childhood.  I am living back with my parents after 10 years of being away and believe me it's the last thing I want, the emotional abuse has returned, and now that I'm an adult living there I try and defend myself, but it gets me no-where and the situation is made worse tenfold.

I have always been a bit ""off"" or ""odd"" from childhood with extreme shyness to the point of me running away from my mother's friends if they said ""hello"" to me in the street, I can't explain why I did this.  This continued throughout childhood, into my teens and in my late teens there was some respite of this shyness where I became overconfident and a complete idiot at times with the stupid stuff I did.  This lasted about 3 years until I fell into a deeper depression, I seeked help and was diagnosed with clinical depression, tried various SSRI's over the years, they worked for a very short while (after the first few weeks and the effects started to kick in I only felt ok for a month at max) then I was back to being volatile with extreme thoughts and emotions, the Doctor put me on Prozac (otherwise known as Fluoxetine here - I didn't even know it was Prozac at the time) and it made me explode into serious rages, has anyone else on here experienced this?   Eventually I gave up, I thought I was better and decided to come off my meds, I had periods of being volatile and I just thought it was ""who I was"", it didn't register to me that it could be a mental health problem at the time.  I had very volatile long term relationships and ultimately my moods destroyed 2 of them.  I was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder a few years ago as well, I didn't always feel this was completely right however, I always knew there was something more there, they gave me seroquel for panic attacks at the time these were only supposed to be used for periods of severe panic, I ended up taking them everyday though because they seemed to help my general mood, they made me extremely drowsy though, and I just didn't care at the time. They ran out, and I just didn't have the courage or motivation to attend the psychology appointments because quite frankly I'm crap at talking to people about how I feel and getting my point across was nigh on impossible at the time so frustration crept in as I didn't feel GAD was the correct diagnosis.

I gave up on any form of treatment for a couple of years until a major life event happened last year, I was moved around and back in with my parents as I just had no choice, I was desperate for help at this time I was going absolutely crazy and suicidal thoughts were daily.  I began to see a psychiatrist who took some time to decide what was wrong with me, this is partly my fault of course due to me not being talkative enough and tending only to give one word answers, it took me some time to build up a trust with her and a few weeks before I felt truly able to express myself properly, it was then she came up with me being possibly Bipolar and put me on a low dose of Lamictal, which did nothing of course initially, about 3 months later after an increase in the dose I started to feel a little different, mostly in the way I reacted to things, I still had the swings, but they were slightly less severe than before, then I had a fantastic week away from home, I was happy and at ease and I felt very stable, I started to forget to take my meds and unfortunately it continued from there.  Since returning home from that week away I have been the worst I have ever been, the most unstable and messed up.  I have experienced all moods within the space of 2 hours some days, I have had hallucinations, paranoid delusions and elation at nothing, I find things that aren't funny hilarious, despite all of this I feel like my overall mood is severely depressed to the extent I can't get out of bed some days, I am extremely suicidal and I feel that if one more slightly bad thing happens to me I will snap and go through with it.  

I haven't told my psychiatrist about stopping and restarting my meds.  They currently think I'm on 100mg of Lamictal per day, when in reality I'm taking 50mg, this is because I didn't want to immediatly start on the higher does after being off it for about a month as I heard it can be harmful.  I still have 25mg pills that I use to get the 50mg a day.  She said that it's extremely likely that I am bipolar but they need a few weeks of further treatment before they can officially diagnose it.

I realise it's my own fault for stopping my meds I guess, but I have learned my lession now and really want to go ahead with this, my next appointment with the psychiatrist isn't until March.  I just feel like I'm going crazy now.  I'm being very hostile to people I speak to online for no reason.  I don't even know how I feel some days, if I'm angry, elated or depressed, as they are changing so quickly now.   I don't even know if these meds will help me, I'm hearing things at times that aren't there, I self harm as well and have done since being a teen (it frustrates me that there only seems to help available to teens for this, it's as if older people don't do it?), although it's not ""severe"" harming, I still put myself through pain and slight bleeding.  

I haven't told my psych about seeing and hearing things either, I really should I know, unfortunately the lady I was seeing has moved to another practice and I have yet to meet my knew psych, which is really really unnerving to me, I just got comfortable with the previous one.  I am starting to write things down to show them this instead.  Quite worried about having to go on Lithium actually if they do suggest this in the near future, although it seems to help a lot of people I have a physical health condition that would probably be aggrivated by Lithium, it seems to be fine to prescribe to me though from what I've looked up online but I'd need extra checks, and well, I'm sick of seeing doctors as it is.

Since this Bipolar has been mentioned to me, I have watched so many documentaries, videos on youtube from people with Bipolar, read so much stuff online, and quite frankly I'm still overwhelmed by all of it.  I now wonder if everything I'm doing is Bipolar or ""me"".  I don't even know who I am anymore.

I have no idea if I should actually be in a psych ward or not, they always ask me if I feel suicidal and I say ""yes daily"" and they always ask me if I make plans to do so. I don't really make plans per say, but it's the snapping that seems to the most troublesome issue with me.  In this country they discourage people from being in psych wards and they have closed down a lot of the larger facilities and now focus on community help, I don't even know if they would take me as I am at the moment, all I know is that I can't cope anymore, I want to die and I'm fed up. I have a constant high heartrate from stress and anxiety as well.  I have no life, no friends, no job, nothing.  I feel pointless and worthless right now.  I want to go to college in September, it's a real possibility for me, academically at least, but the way I am now I'd drop out at the drop of a hat and I don't want to do that again. 

I knew I'd end up rambling a lot, sorry.  TLDR.  Thanks for reading. 

Edit:  Just lost it again, filling in a form online and I press backspace by accident and the information is gone... snapped some pencils and self harmed in a fit of rage.  This is what I mean.

That is a decision to be made with you and your doctor; I am solely sharing my experiences because I find value in them, and hope you will too.

Okay. So as the title says, I have been medication-free for 4 years. Back when I was 14 years old I was diagnosed with depression. I was immediately put on medication, which numbed me. It had mostly a bandaid effect but allowed me to be kinda functional, which at the time was as good as things would get. eventually by the time I was 19 years old I was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 after a psychotic episode. I was immediately hospitalized, put on countless medications and continued to suffer and be in and out of the hospital over the course of the next 3 years. By now it had been approx. 8 years that I'd been struggling with mental illness - I couldn't work, could barely stay in school, was overweight as a side effect from one of many medications and just utterly shit-feeling. Eventually, I went through a suicide attempt - My life was shit, I wasn't doing anything and I couldn't feel anything so why bother?

Something changed after my suicide attempt, though. Luckily I survived (obviously) but I no longer had the desire to play this meds game. It took a leap of faith and a lot of support from close ones and my doctors, but I decided to try to manage off of medication. this was the best decision I had ever made in my life. I made a lot of strict lifestyle changes - No caffeine (except for occasional tea), no alcohol, no drugs, a strict vegan diet with supplements (B6 vitamins, Omega 3s ect), Daily meditation and excersizing and so on. These lifestyle changes have been maintaining me for the past 4 years and have made EXTREME differences for me!

I am in university studying psychology and sociology with a 4.0GPA. I am extremely athletic and training to run a marathon at the moment. I read, I write, I'm generative and give back to the community. I have friends, a social life and my own apartment that I pay for with my own money working full time. I have so much more than I ever thought I would, both inside and out, and I have done this by finding natural ways to heal myself. I learned about other cultural perspectives on people like us - many cultures do not regard those with mental illness as ill, but rather as special individuals. This perspective has really helped me.

Do I still get highs and lows? Yes, I do, but I am able to manage them with help from family, friends, and doctors. I still see a psychiatrist AT LEAST once a month no matter how good or bad I feel. When I do feel manic, I tell others to watch me in case I start to overspend or try to do risky shit (usually doesn't happen). If I'm feeling depressed, I take time to rest and surrender to it, knowing that it's something I have to ride out. I force myself to eat well and excersize especially during these times. I update those around me who I trust about what's going on inside of me. I write a diary entry every single day about how I'm feeling and then review them weekly to try and pick up signs if I'm slipping into mania and depression. I still have psychotic features here and there (voices and visions) but they are not so extreme that I cannot manage (I especially make sure to document these to see if they are getting worse, and share them with my family and psych doc.)

Doing all of this is HARD you guys. I have to dedicate EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING to maintaining my health. if even one element falls off - sleep, eat, exercise, meditation - then EVERYTHING falls apart. It is VITAL that I take care of myself, and it's like a second full time job. However, the latter would be to be barely functional, on 8 meds a day feeling nothing and being able to create nothing (I am also an artist).

I don't know if anyone can relate to my experience and ONCE AGAIN I am NOT recommending that you go off meds nor am I reporting them (I know that meds work really well for a lot of people), but if you are med resistant like me, don't give up. try and find a new angle. You can be happy and healthy. Communicate with those around you and form a network to help you. A lot of the time other people will pick up that something is wrong before you pick up on it. I'm so blessed to be where I am today, and I want all of us to be happy. I love you guys.

So I have recently left for college (after getting over an 8 month depression). My meds are great, and I feel like I have been very stable. I used my new found confidence to fill out the mounds of paper work and write the many letters that were necessary to return. 


I was bouncing around the idea of taking a lower interest loan from my parents over the student loans.  3 days out of the house, my mother is accusing me with 'demons' of arrogance, ingratitude, disrespect, bitterness, and anger. I was nothing but polite and communicative about my feelings last week, and this email just completely blindsided me. I think that she feels that if she is not in control over me and telling me what to do, I will crash and burn. But I have lived on my own for 5 years before.


I talked to my therapist, and afterward, I have accepted the student loans.


I'm free from her now, but I still have to deal with her. She is my mother. I have a brother (28 years old) who lives at home with BP1, and my mother must think that I will get as bad as that with my BP2. And she always sees herself as a martyr in caring for her children. She can do no wrong (she hasn't admitted a mistake in years), but I can only do wrong.


Here's the kicker: she's an internal medicine doctor. So she thinks she is an expert in bipolar, even more so than my psychiatrist and my therapist, whom she thinks is a quack.


I just need to get away I guess, and out of her control. I think she knows that, and is only attacking me harder.

I can tell when I'm headed up or down, and I do whatever I can to minimize the damage. Lift myself up when I'm down, and find an anchor when I'm up. And all of this relies on me seeing it coming.

Lamictal - 25 mg (tonight is my first night of 50mg)
Lexapro - 20 mg (planning on tapering off once I've been on lamictal for a few months)
Xanex - .5 mg 3 times a day

My diagnosis was: cyclothymia, GAD(generalized anxiety disorder), and SAD(social anxiety disorder).

Now here's the thing. OBVIOUSLY the first of my drugs that is going to work is the xanex. My anxiety of both kind have gone WAY down to the point I'm finally able to rationalize with myself when I do feel anxious and calm myself down. I'm actually making great improvements in my ability to talk to people (ex/ I made a joke with a customer). 

For the past week, I haven't gotten stressed over stupid things like if my kitchen was clean or not, I haven't had to pep talk myself into going to the store, I haven't snapped at my husband for not doing something exactly the way I do it, and I haven't exploded over small things.

In fact, thanks to /u/yahalomay I was able to come up with a way that if I AM becoming out of control with my anger, I can healthily say this to him in the moment and he stops so I don't become violent.

I could really make an entire list here how in the past week, I have improved just immensely.

My problem is....I've been thinking that maybe I don't have cyclothymia, and it was all from my anxiety. And as soon as I think it, I tell myself to STOP thinking it because that is exactly what I DON'T want to think. I don't want to think ""All I need is xanex and my problems are solved!!"" and then screw up my chance at keeping this stability. Because I know that the other meds haven't had a chance to do their job yet. And one week doesn't mean I'm cured. I'm just having a good week because I'm not stressed and I'm able to use the xanex to help me use my tools to lower my anxiety.

So how do you guys (especially those with anxiety problems) tell yourself that just because your anxiety may be under control and that may be helping, that it's only a part of the puzzle?",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

A couple months ago, I entered a manic period which coincided with my second semester living on my own at university, and the Trinidadian Carnival Season  [ [Like Ah Boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBnXCEvEMtM) was the song of season, but it's hard to describe it fairly. To say that the country parties for a month doesn't do it any justice, but it'll have to do for this post.]

In the midst of this, I met a 'pretty cool,' foreign exchange student, but because of everything else, she was the shiniest thing in the whole wide world. I approached her the same way I spent a week researching coffee machines because coffee was life, and I needed to know everything about it, and I really really needed a $500 Espresso Machine. Except that week of binging and unreasonable fascination lasted more than a week because people can be so much more engaging than the history of the French Press. Needless to say we partied lots and something resembling a romance happened. 

Things didn't go horribly bad until after Carnival though. I figured that since I had so much fun while manic, that I could cope with *abruptly stopping my meds*. In the two weeks that followed, I managed to make a series of comically reckless decisions revolving around this person which managed to alienate my friends and generally fuck things up. It was *comically bad* .

Then, I started to crash, and overnight, I lost all interest in her and regretted everything. Ultimately, I took responsibility for my actions and didn't try to blame the disease or anything, and of course this is barely a tl;dr of what happened. There's a host of other unmentioned things which would need more context than I'm willing to discuss, but there you have it.

And that kids, is how I learned that the hypomania is not a ""good"" thing, and that the meds aren't just there for when you're feeling depressed.","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

I know this is bit of a taboo topic around these parts, and that this subreddit is very encouraging of using medication to deal with our collective disorder. I have absolutely no problem with that, and think that a lot of the time medication can do wonderful things for people. I feel like (as someone who is Bipolar Type 2) that in the case of Type 1 it makes even more sense to use medication as the manic periods can be even more difficult to control (Once again, I've never experienced true mania so it's hard for me to say).

But personally, I've always been against taking medication to deal with my own issues. I have a close, supportive group of friends who are aware of my disorder and are always there for me when I need them. I'm a very self-aware person and am good at identifying my emotions and where they are stemming from which helps me through it quite a bit.

Not only that, but my fields of study (Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science) are all heavily focused around the use of logic and problem solving. All of the concepts and skills that I've learned so far have also been very applicable to the anxiety attacks that I'll have from time to time. 

Between these supports and my therapist I've always felt like I can manage without taking medication. I got to wondering though, how many others are out there like me? How many of you are dealing with your disorder without meds and feel like you're succeeding? 

Like I said, I think medication can be very useful and in some cases necessary. But at the same time, I feel like on there are also anecdotal cases where meds were not necessary. I'm not trying to  call anyone out, or start an argument between meds vs no meds, only attempting to facilitate a discussion between the community.

On top of that, people who are currently taking meds, what's it like? How does it change your perception of reality? How do you feel in the short-term? In the long-term? This is a very interesting subject for me and I would love to hear other perspectives.","['nsubj', 'dobj']",1,neu_vader

She has always struggled with moods/sleeping, but only four years ago we have figured out she is manic/depressive and only a couple years has been diagnosed as bipolar. Every time we get her help a few months or a year later, she decides she doesn't need it anymore. I think she is addicted to manic episodes and the attention she gets from us when we are trying to help. 

She has been going to college, but this latest semester she had a psychotic episode. She missed a few doc appointments and stopped refilling her antidepressants, forcing herself to stop cold-turkey and causing a break. 
My sister and I took her to a mental-health emergency appointment and they said she was a great candidate for a long-term program with counselors, doctors, therapists, etc. (Everything she may need to get on track). However, since then, she hasn't contacted them to get on the waiting list. Also, she failed out of school because she couldn't get her work done. Recently she was also fired from her part time job (only been working for a month or so) for ""not fitting in"". 
The latest news is she stopped her mood stabilizers (around the time she failed and got before getting fired) and decided to move back in with her toxic and narcissistic mother at home at the end of the summer. The reason for stopping her meds is she thinks she will be able to just control it herself.

I am starting to tire of constantly getting her help and then months later she has stopped trying. I think I need some support and also a new way to approach her. Has anyone had a friend or someone say something that got them to realize how important medication and counseling is to controlling this disorder? Or that finally helped you seek help for real?","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

It seemed the more I asked for help, the less I got.


The most ""help"" I got during that time was getting antidepressants thrown at me (*while later telling me bipolar medication is not a ""cure""- they never said that the about ADs that sent me into psychosis*), the least help was getting ignored in emergency for hours (*I was brought there by my husband, and I ended up leaving, he called the cops, I got cuffed for trying to run and got brought back to the hospital where I was then promptly accepted overnight*) while I sat and watched seeing others get in ""ahead"" of me in line.


It doesn't help that I have other chronic help issues- asthma, fibromyalgia, and cervical osteoarthritis to where I have been admitted to been referred to as a ""substance abuser"" and ""drug seeker"" and somatic pain aka ""all in your head"" and ""you're just depressed"". It took years, and I literally went across the ocean to go to my parents home country to get MRIs and see specialists and get them translated to get diagnosed for the neck arthritis before my doctor would agree with it (*after he added the disclaimer that I ""shouldn't"" be feeling any pain at my young age of then 24 years*).


With my knowledge and experience as a ""consumer"" (*not even a ""patient""- just another number to them*) I have become incredibly disenfranchised and I don't trust many doctors or their opinions until I can have it verified by another opinion or months to years of my own research (*not just ""googling""*). I have become a ""loud"" advocate and I think that my knowledge and understanding of their jargon intimidates them at times, giving them the impression that because I'm ""so smart and aware"" that I shouldn't be so ""disabled"". The joke is that I wouldn't of become so disabled by age 29 if they just could of treated me to help me manage my chronic conditions instead of constant invalidation (*nice way of saying gas lighting*) and their ignorance.

I was given Zoloft as a medication. It worked...okay. But after a year my medication wore out and I was too lazy to go back to get it refilled. Honestly, I did not feel much of a difference.


 Fast forward 6 years. I started looking at all this bipolar stuff about a week ago. I'm relating so well to everything I've read about it. However, I don't have any money for insurance or getting myself an appointment. I'm not even sure if I need to. I've dealt with it the last 6 years successfully. If I am bipolar, then I've created ways around it and ways to cope. For instance, I work in food service and I love it. When the restaurant is busy, I ignore my emotions and just do work. Everything works so clearly and efficiently when I'm busy at work. I have managed to create a method that gets me up every morning. I created a habit so that as soon as the alarm goes off, I head to the shower and that wakes me up enough for the day. I set dedlines for myself so as soon as I see 2PM or whatever on my clock, I get up no matter how shitty it feels. These little things get me through a lot...but not everything...

Just yesterday at work, I couldn't cope. I didn't even know what was wrong. I felt like a listless spider monkey. I had so much energy that I could have used, but I couldn't focus on a damn thing and just walked around like a zombie. Someone even asked my if I was bipolar...I just responded 'uh...maybe? I don't really know'. All of my 'solutions' don't work all the time, either. My fiance has done every last house chore in the last month. Where could I possibly get that kind of motivation? You have to beg me just to take out the trash...then i have to set a deadline...then I have to have 2 hours of just sitting on my ass by myself to prepare myself for the deadline I just set...

Despite this...I've still graduated college (with an applied physics degree no less), I have a loving and understanding SO, and I live as happy as I can be. Focusing on possible emotional issues just seems to make me realize how emotional I am. So I guess I'm asking...do I drop this whole thing and carry on as I was? or do I keep track of my mood and try and save up for some sort of appointment?

I'm having a hard time talking about ""what's wrong"" because it isn't, to me, life events that landed me where I'm at. It's utter exhaustion. I'm tired of doing the things I'm ""supposed"" to do - removing myself from a toxic relationship, stopping drinking, cutting out caffiene. I quit smoking cigarettes, all drugs, am exercising. Took up a hobby. Not all of these things at once, mind you, but gradually over the past two years. I moved to a new area that I really loved.

None of it was enough. Even if I can ""play healthy"" I still feel as if I'm constantly overwhelmed by ""the sickness"".

After many medication changes I was finally put on a mood stabilizer. It is a starter dose, but it helped to slow my brain down and helped with my communication for the first few days. It needs upped, but I think we might be on to something.

My problem right now is that my therapist for group has spent the last couple days telling me and the rest of the group that we aren't ""mentally ill"" and keeps talking about how we feel is a product of our ""life choices"" and that we eventually ""won't need medicine"". As well, she's given us a lot of horror stories about what the psych meds can do to our bodies.

I've tried to communicate to her that I feel like I'm dealing with my LIFE pretty effectively, it's being in my own head that's the problem. She insists its because of the way that I live and the decisions that I make. She doesn't seem receptive at all to what I'm trying to say; and I don't know how to put it to make her understand that I need coping mechanisms for bipolar disorder, not life in general.

Clinging to the idea that our pain doesn't have to be hidden; my last thread of hope these days as everything falls to pieces around me making my escape plan feel like my only way out. Inspired by the energy of [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/24shc4/yall_want_to_start_a_really_agressive_civil/), I have this idea for a social movement led and powered by people with mental illnesses, demanding something better than the shit that makes dealing with our illnesses even more difficult than it has to be.

I'm imagining a crowd of people holding signs with I NEED HELP on them, some of the signs personalized.  ""I NEED HELP...explaining my doctors' appointments to my boss w/o disclosing my illness."" ""I NEED HELP...paying my rent when I get too depressed to work and the meds take 6-8 weeks to work, at best."" ""I NEED HELP...taking care of my kids when my flashbacks take over and universal childcare would really go far."" Imagine if things got a little rowdy and the cops decided to do what some cops do to protesters. I can imagine the photos now of the po-po beating down on people holding these signs. I NEED HELP.

Self-advocacy/empowerment/person-first/what-have-you be damned...this is a fucking crisis and we don't have time to piss around about language. I fucking need help or else I'm fucking going to die and getting help has been and continues to be fucking impossible. The only self-advocacy I'm capable of right now is a desperate plea for help and I feel like America really needs to know that, and to know that I am far from the only one.

Imagine how much less complicated bipolar symptom management would be if we lived in a country with a proper medical system in which being too sick to work didn't result in losing your access to medical care. Imagine socialized medicine. Imagine a [basic income](http://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome). And the rest of America can imagine living in a place where they didn't have to be irrationally afraid that crazy people are going to shoot up their schools and movie theaters, a country in which you no longer need to stand awkwardly by while someone suffers an episode in public or needs to scream the voices away.

My last psych was a horrible fit for me, not wanting to explore if I was bipolar when I asked and only trying me on meds once and taking me off after just a few months without trying other doses. Towards the end before I left I felt more depressed trying to think things up just to talk to her about. She wouldn't really instigate conversations and I would feel like an idiot sitting there, trying to think of what to say and having trouble.

Skip ahead to beginning of this year when my mom was diagnosed with bipolar and said once she started the correct meds everything felt incredibly better. I had been thinking for awhile that I should try again with a better psych, so at this point I began thinking of it more. My mom's psych didn't want to take me as she wouldn't feel comfortable (makes sense) but finally gave us a few referrals.

One big problem is I'm going through a huge life change right now and unsure if I should try to fit in a psych automatically. For the past almost 12 years, I've worked on night shift and suddenly I finally got the opportunity to go to day shift. I had already been quasi mixed as I worked MT/HF nights and Sat day, so it will likely be better to finally be completely one shift. Yet I've always been a night person, my schedule shifted by 4 hours to most people with me getting up at noon and going to bed at 4am. So now I'm going to be a ""normal"" person in terms of work with more responsibility as well.

I found this sub several months ago when I had a dose increase of my antidepressant and it sent me a little bit (a lot) off the rails. That whole thing led to me being diagnosed after almost 15 years of showing all the signs, and seeing myself in a lot of your stories really put some things into perspective for me. So yeah, thanks :-) 

Anyway, one of the most helpful suggestions I've seen here is to do daily mood charting (which my pdoc was also very excited about). I started that at the end of January. I wound up deciding on a -5 (depressed) to 5 (manic) scale. Not that I'd be rating myself at a -5 or 5, because that pretty much means I'm in the hospital or jail :-) It's not perfect because it's hard to account for all the variations/symptoms, but close enough for now. And it really does help - here's a look at [my mood chart](http://imgur.com/QdapADF).

The high peak in mid-February (a 4 on the goddamn_problem bipolar rating scale) was the worst of it - I was hiding in my office, crying while writing nonsense in my notebook and seriously considering walking over to the ER to check myself in; I just didn't want to tell my boss I was having a mental health crisis and needed to go home lol. 

The first black vertical line was the next appointment with my pdoc (it was supposed to be sooner but we had a couple freak snowstorms that closed the whole city), and she immediately lowered my wellbutrin dose and added lamotrigine. I was still up and down, more up than down, but not nearly as much as before.

The second black vertical line is when I got to my current dose of lamotrigine (150mg) earlier this month. My energy shot up again for a few days after that but look at that last section! Ten solid days of zero (ie, stable/normal) and counting. That's by far the longest stretch in the short time I've been charting, and I had been considerably up or down for at least 18 months before that (more down than up). I'm pretty sure there were no more than a handful of zero days during that time frame. 

I can't really say for sure that my cocktail is responsible for settling me down - looking back over my life, my episodes tend to last several months. It's possible that this one has just run its course. But, the graph *does* make me feel better about dealing with the side effects long enough to see if the meds will help long term.

We're in such a rocky situation right now, which is mainly my fault. I've *never* dealt first hand with anyone that has had clinical depression, until now. I admit, I find it really tough.

Well, she let me stay on Klonopin for sleep and anxiety, lowered my dose of Lamictal and added Prozac for panic attacks. I went on a job search and was hired on the spot yesterday. Yes, it's a slow paced job and below my education level, but it feels so good to be symptom free and back in the world again.

I've only been in this depression for a day or two but its extremely evident.  Last time I fell into this kind of depression I accepted the fact I was going to kill myself.  I just didn't want to screw it up; didn't have a good opportunity or the right tools available if that makes sense.  My normal self is afraid of where this is going and my depressed self is content with being depressed and with fantasizing about suicide.  I apologize because I don't know if I'm complaining or asking for help.  I would give anything for a drug that would work and would work right now.

EDIT:
RESPONSE TO ALL:  Thank you all of you for responding.  I haven't figured out my moods yet clearly because I felt like I was slipping into depression but it was gone the day after I posted this.  I've been on Tegratol for 5 weeks and haven't felt it working at all but perhaps now its finally is which would be a godsend. I've also tried things like consciously/deliberately been extroverted (which I never am and I usually become very introverted when I become depressed which only makes things worse.  I can still feel traces of depression, lack of motivation, lack of energy, and drawing quick conclusions to people not liking me but something or multiple things must be working now: 1) the meds are finally helping 2) I am able to keep my head above the after if I am conscious of my mood and actions AND/OR 3) I just don't yet understand my mood changes.  I'm guessing a little bit of all 3.  Again thank you for your responses.  I think with this situation, learning is sharing in both ways.  I've finished most of my midterms and I am excited leave on this trip tomorrow and I think I will be fine.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

This new diagnosis is making me feel so insecure that I’m “crazy” that I don’t even know how to make an assessment of situations. I’ll start from the top:
Last month I began taking the anti-depressant Effexor 150mg. Before I began taking Effexor I sat down with my boyfriend of 10 months and told him I was going to begin taking a new medicine and needed his help in monitoring my behavior and to let me know if I was behaving unusually. And holy shit, did I begin behaving unusually. It took me a few weeks to notice but I had become a drastically different person – I was basically verbally abusive to my boyfriend, almost cheated on him, I was drinking beyond excess, stopped going to my classes and work, and ended up spending $1,500 that I didn’t even have. In one month on Effexor, I tore apart my life, while humiliating both myself and my boyfriend in very public situations. 
I don’t know how to explain it, but I was virtually unaware of how bad my behavior had been while on Effexor that I didn’t realize until last week when I became so drunk, that I was physically abusive to my boyfriend and tried to cheat on him right in front of him. I cannot explain enough that this is NOT in my character, nor has it ever been. I have felt so ashamed, and terrified of myself since the following morning when he told me what happened. 
Earlier this week, on Tuesday, I went to the doctor to explain what had happened and after a lengthy session was assessed as having bipolar type 1. My doctor told me that Effexor had incited a manic phase while I was in a depressive phase? I was prescribed 250mg Depakote to take 3 times daily. 

I told my boyfriend about this, and offered him some readings – and the next day he broke up with me.

The following day, I had to drive myself to the emergency room because, while I’m still not sure, I think I was having a panic attack induced by the Depakote? I was prescribed some Lorazepam to take until I guess I can get in with the psychiatrist (I have scheduled an appointment for December 10) to figure out another course of medicine? (I have stopped taking Depakote now)

I honestly don’t know what I’m asking here, I just feel so completely confused, insecure and alone. I need some kind of advice. I feel like I’m fucking crazy. What am I supposed to do while I wait for my psychiatrist appointment? 

Also I don’t know if the bit about my boyfriend should go under r/relationships or not I just don’t know who to ask. Is this how dating as bipolar will always be? Is there any way to properly explain my behavior? Do I have to start every new date now with “By the way I’m bipolar?” Who all do I share the information with, and when? Will medicine actually stabilize my moods in a way where I won’t suddenly hurt my loved ones?

I know this is long, I just don’t know what to do. If one of you would please just share your experience and let me know if it gets better.
PS. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make very much sense, or seems jumbled – it’s the best I can communicate right now. Also, I don’t know if it helps but I’m a 21 y/o female.

I came down with a pretty bad manic episode last March where the mania and pschosis lasted like 2 months or so and was re-diagnosed with bipolar and suspected of having Asperger's.... obviously...

Anyway, now I live in this hotel and have social insurance from the government (more than I need, actually.) The last couple of weeks I've just been smoking pot as much as I can and then drinking once in a while. Well, I'm not suicidal or psychotic anymore but I'm still extremely anxious and unmotivated. Room's a total mess, my hygiene is a joke, I'm gaining weight and worst of all, I have no idea where my life is going...

So, I decided a while ago that it's time for a break from the pot to see if the meds are doing any better, but I can't figure out what to do with myself. So, a friend suggested I buy an Xbox or something. I don't know why but I just feel guilty doing that but I just can't get back into programming, math and I really don't think I can work right now either.

This is not how I wanted my life to go. I had an interested high-paying job, traveled, had girlfriends and now it's just been months and months of nothing......

How do people usually recover from such a catastrophic episode?

She told him no problems here, nothing to see and then when on with her rosy fucking life.  
By 4:00 that afternoon she's back to full on bipolar pissed off at me.

I'm running out for Ideas here. I'm tired of being her bipolar dog she can kick when her meds aren't working.

I've been under treatment for couple years now, and have been in partial remission for about six months at this point. My regiment is solid, no longer needs tweaking, my episodes are down to short and relatively easy to manage compared to the living hell I used to experience. I'm back at school and about to finish up my degree only a couple months behind- which after a year of medical leave, is something I'm immensely proud of. So things are going well.

However, there are some lingering issues I wanted your input and experience on. I figure only another bipolar patient might understand.

Chiefly, even on high doses of mood stabilizers, I still can't ever seem to find the middle ground of mood and stability. I still overreact emotionally to most day to day things, and while I can reign it in almost immediately it seems to unsettle me enough where I can't reach a feeling of normalcy... ever. To me the issue lies in how much time is wasted trying to prevent a wide variation in mood. It takes up way too much time, breaks up flow of conversations, and it really shifts my focus on myself- which in the long term pushes me away from my goal of becoming less self-obsessed.

So anyone have experience with coming back to baseline?

Secondly I was curious if anyone else is getting tired of the constant micromanagement of medication dosing and side effects necessary to keep them working and stop them from becoming prohibitively problematic.

I'm talking managing blood sugar, water intake, tolerating nausea and headaches, eating enough or not too much, as well as the less obvious social side effects- whether or not you can drink on them, whether they make you antisocial or not, or the extreme example- not knowing if the medication is making a close relatives death affect you significantly less.

I know these complaints are well worth an effective treatment of an otherwise lethal disorder (at least in my case) but I was wondering if anyone has any advice they could share on how to handle the above mentioned.

Finally... is anyone else having issues trying to mature? I feel like the several year mess of emerging bipolar disorder occupied me during some pretty pivotal milestones in growing up. Of course matury doesn't just happen- but I am intimately aware of how immature I can be when I'm struggling with bipolar. Not only that, but in general... there's a paper on pubmed about how a majority of bipolar disorder patients whose disorder emerges in adolescence end up learning to focus almost exclusively on recovery and their disorder while everyone else is learning how to responsibly spend and save, move to an apartment, interact with the other sex... so the bipolar patient can catch up, but most commonly they are too occupied with staying sane and alive to make those kinds of steps.

So am I alone here in feeling all this, even after partial remission?",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

We've spent the past ~22 months of thinking she had ante-partum depression, then post-partum depression, then post-partum depression with social anxiety disorder.  
Other potential diagnoses that have been discussed is PTSD (from the pregnancies/near loss of life) or some kind of trauma-onset bi-polar.   (are there different kinds of bipolar?)  She has been on disability for almost two years, and this December it either goes away or becomes permanent disability.

We have had a long journey to get here.  We had trouble getting pregnant (18 months), three failed pregnancies over the next 18 months [one anencephaly (discovered at 21 weeks), one ""simple"" miscarriage, and then an ectopic pregnancy that almost also claimed my wife's life as well].  During our fourth pregnancy (which has blessed us with an incredible baby boy who is now 18 months old), my wife had some severe emotional difficulties that led to her ante-partum depression diagnosis.  This became post-partum as soon as baby was born.  Over the past 18 months she has tried all sorts of combinations of drugs (I'll add them later in an edit, although that may be a moot point if they were for a different diagnosis), to mixed effect.  People often ask how she is doing, but that question really has to be addressed in 4-hour blocks.

This past while has been very difficult for me, for whatever that's worth.  I've tried to support her as best as I can, but have had my feelings hurt time and time again.  She's certainly not been up for discussing my hurt feelings, so I've just swallowed it and dealt with it alone (which isn't going to be healthy long-term).  

Recently she's talked about how she doesn't feel like she can talk to me without me being defensive.  I've tried to take and take and take, but sometimes I try to point out parts of her perception that aren't accurate, and then I'm 'defensive.'  I'm really struggling with walking the line between gently showing her how I'm trying to love her through this in different ways, how she's isn't alone in this, and not responding defensively to some of her assertions.  It's hard to do.

I keep trying to remind myself that any pain/difficulty/frustration that I'm experiencing is nothing compared to what she's dealing with.  And I can take a lot of crap for a finite period of time.  But now the possibility that this is a for-the-rest-of-our-lives-thing scares me.  I'm also scared about the implications for her perceptions/behaviors, and what that means for her caring for our son.  I'm concerned that my attempts to love/help her have been unsuccessful.  I'm concerned about being able to work and care for her when she has bad moments (for my job I go away for a couple overnights a year, a couple weekends a year and one week a year)--it's not a good thing when she's by herself.


QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

1. Can you please help me understand what someone who has bi-polar would most appreciate from her spouse?  How can I best love her during this diagnosis time, and long-term?

2. Are there different kinds of bi-polar?  Does ""trauma-onset"" mean anything?

3. Could a change to a diagnosis of bipolar could lead to her losing her disability coverage?

4. Is our son at risk of physical harm?  Am I?

5. Lately she's been very depressed. Nothing sounds good to her, she doesn't eat much, and she's hard to get out of bed.  What has been helpful to you when you're in that place?

6. What medications have been helpful to some of you?  Have any been really sucky?

7. I could use some affirmation.  Got any for me?  (Shameless begging, but I'm having a hard time as well.)

8. What would you like to share with me--what advice do you have, from the position of someone who has bipolar, for someone who doesn't?

Thank you all very much!

I just recently was diagnosed with bipolar II after in depth neurological evaluations and testing. I was prescribed Lamictal and have been on it for a little over a month, currently at 100 MG. I have had some crazy dreams, a lot of them have caused me to wake up in pure fear / panic and caused me to completely emotionally break down seconds after waking up. 


So far the medicine is not making any noticeable changes to my mood but I've taken enough meds in my life to know it can take a while (especially considering I'm just entering the effective range and am a heavier guy). I just want to know if others have run into the same things and if it gets better. I'm up right now because last night's dream was a bit much and I needed a break.  


To describe one of the most extreme events in one of the dreams... 3 men confronted my fiancé and I, 2 of them took her to another room while the other stayed to take care of me. After subduing the man who stayed behind for me I went to find my fiancé and saw the other 2 men with bolt cutters around her trachea slowly crushing / cutting it open. 


This is not normal... I've had crazy dreams before but these dreams are so overpowering and make me feel so helpless. Last nights was about me being imprisoned to a life of slavery. I remember being thankful I was getting chained up to the chain gang because it meant they weren't going to kill me yet. Every moment of that dream made me thankful to just be alive; I still remember the pure joy of life every minute in that dream. 


Sorry for the long rant but I just need to know if the dreams will calm down. I'm typically not afraid to go to sleep but tonight I just wanted a break. 


Thanks for listening and any experience / advice would be great. 

EDIT: I just want to thank those who have been willing to share their experiences with Lamictal. It's wonderful (even though sad for some) to read that I'm not alone in my experiences / situation in life. I think the hardest thing for me right now is not having someone who is in my same boat to talk to. No one seems to understand what I'm going through and it's comforting to know that others are in the same boat as me even if it saddens me that any of us are in this boat.

I graduated in May 11 with a degree in finance.  Spent about 3 1/2 years going back to school living in a disease infested dump with my uncle.  My uncle was a hoarder.  Yeah, you've probably seen them on TV.  He wouldn't let me clean the house.  It was the only place I could live.  It was either that, or live with my mom and my alcoholic abusive father.  I could have worked, but I really don't think I would have been able to well in school.  Some sacrifices those were.


I have a degree now sitting on a shelf between my tax returns and an origami book.  I worked so hard to get it.  I'm not proud of myself at all.  My grades sucked.  I graduated below a 3.0.  Which sucked because guess what?  Every entry level job required a 3.0.

The only reason I went back to school was for one thing:  To get a good job with a health care plan so I could get some decent mental treatment.  At the time, I was on 2 meds, Lexapro and Provigil.  They worked great.  I was on my way to get those good grades which would inevitably lead to that good job.  But time ran out.

My meds stopped working my senior year.  My grades fell and I graduated by the hair on my nose.  Since then, I've been a complete and utter mess.  I have no health insurance, no job, no life.  I've given up on applying for jobs because I don't even know what I want anymore.  When I go to interviews people can tell there is something wrong with me.  I've lost my passion and enthusiasm.

I look back and wonder if things could have been different if didn't go back to school and get my degree.  Or maybe if I choose another major?  Maybe I should have just stuck with theater and art.  I was good at that.

I don't know where to take my life right now.  What I would like to do is become a math teacher, but in order to do that I need to take at least a years worth of classes.  How can I be successful in my condition?

I've got some cash left over from a job I got earlier this year.  Not much, but I've used it to see a doctor and buy medicine out of pocket.  I figure it would be an investment.  The better I feel the more I can do.

Oh no.  I started Saphris with my Paxil (that I've been on for a year) a month ago.  My husband was overseas at the time so it was left to me to determine if the medicine was working well.  Previous to this, I had been on Abilify.  I thought the medicine was fine, made the switch and have been on it for a month.
 
AND then the last couple of weeks happened.  Totally hyper-sexual to an extreme degree, hubby says I wanted to spend money, was SUPER emotional about EVERY little thing.  The problem is, I always know when I feel depressed and I can say ""Hey hubby, something is wrong, I'm depressed"".  I NEVER know that I'm manic in any way until after the fact.  Is that something anyone else notices?

After the time went by, I plummeted.  Like free fall from a plane plummeted.  So, I got a tattoo to feel better.  No joke.  Friday night I sat there at home crying and feeling miserable wanting to cut (which I haven't done since I was 18, 32 now) and decided the best way to get around this was to get a tattoo.  So, I now have a new one.  It's beautiful, don't get me wrong...I didn't just choose something random that had no meaning...but normally I take a good six months to make sure I want something.  I love it, everyone around me loves it and I feel better....but in the process of this I've left my husband worried and confused because I was honest with him about why I wanted the tattoo.  I'd never cut over a tattoo and I only cut on my left arm...put a tattoo there, problem solved.  Plus let's face it, because no one is stupid, this was a form of cutting, just in a creative way.

This hasn't happened to me in a VERY VERY long time.  Apparently I was seriously stressing out my husband who was scared to confront me with what was going on because he didn't want to make me cry, and that is awful.  He has stopped telling me about his day for fear of stressing me out.  SO many bipolar marriages end in divorce.  All of this scares me.

So!  Today, I called my psych doc and asked her to switch me back to Abilify immediately.  I have an emergency appointment with a therapist tomorrow afternoon because my husband asked me to get into counseling.  Am I on the right track?  Am I missing something?

I am now coming to grips with the fact that don't have the control I thought I did. things are about to get bad. I am well in to a depressive phase and this one is lasting a lot longer than usual and I am terrified that when the pendulum swings I will go full on off the rails.

What I am getting at is how do you go about finding a good doctor and getting on some meds? 

Will the meds screw me up as bad as i'm afraid they will?

I had a bout of depression three years ago. Went to a psychiatrist, who took my history. I was labeled as Bipolar after a few sessions--apparently this should have been a red flag, and hindsight is 20/20. I was medicated. Started seeing another psychiatrist due to a move. That doctor reversed the diagnosis immediately and put me on a generic antidepressant. I was on it for awhile, depression went away, and I tapered off of it at the psychiatrist's recommendation. This psychiatrist suggested it was an isolated incident triggered by a life event, and not genetic/something I'd be battling the rest of my life.

I've been medication free (and out of treatment entirely) for over a year. No relapse. 

Had I stayed with my initial psychiatrist I would probably still be on medication--and worse, medication that wouldn't have helped my particular condition. This medication would have probably greatly altered my personality and physical appearance in ways that I don't even want to contemplate. Aside from this, the diagnosis itself would have limited quite a few of my current career considerations. Say what you will, a Bipolar diagnosis carries a ton of more stigma than an isolated incident of depression. It closes doors. 

Don't stop your medications. Don't convince yourself you're OK (based on this post, this advice.) But don't hesitate to get a second opinion. In fact, if you're feeling uncomfortable, *do* get a second opinion. Bipolar diagnosis is serious stuff, and the aggressiveness with which psychiatrists assign it as a diagnosis is upsetting.

Just didn't really connect with people at that point. Still have a problem of connecting to people, talking and the way you act with others, like a foreign alien. 


Didn't know where the depression was coming from, didn't even know I was depressed or knew the meaning of depression I just felt lost and afraid. Now, I flux from depression into happiness into anger for no reason, each day changes, may wake up good or wake up like a zombie with no energy. I could be  sleeping bad on those days, or it could be anything else. I sleep from 1030 to about 11, almost 12 hours of sleep. Its the damn meds I'm on, puts me to sleep but doesn't help anything else. I think the doctors think I'm seeing and hearing things, I could be, but I doubt it.  I'm not to fond of doctors since they are just want to know all your secrets and your past to try and do something with it and make you have goals, that are hard to do in the stage of my social function.  One of my doctors once told me, you must learn to drive, others would just stare at me, I didn't want to be in the office with a doctor and just talk down to me about how I should be more open, making me close off more. 


I get anxiety over almost everything, I ride in the car, I have a panic attack about what happens if we hit, I get panic attacks if we get near big sources of water, because I had a nightmare of going off a bridge in a car few years ago. If we get to close to a car ill freak out a bit. I don't want to tell anyone because they will think that's just stupid. I get anxiety over the way I walk, and talk. When I get around people, it comes out of more anxiety, it could be the store, if someone gets near me in the store isles ill have anxiety of what could happen if they did something, or what do I do with the person. Anxiety to talk to people, for years people would know me by the word yeah, great for staying off the local cops radar for drug dealers and gangsters. If they ever would look for me, they would ask someone what my name was and they would say yeah.  Funny to think of it, home many people didn't actually knew my name from my past, didn't have much friends, just didn't know how to make them. Even now I don't even know how to do it now. It feels like if I do something wrong or say something wrong, the whole world would melt down.  That's not a good feeling.


My memory is spotty, just like my uncles who has brain damage. He got in a car wreck and was in a coma, but I've never been in a coma. I have cracked my head open twice, when I was young and growing up. I've see black when I used to hit myself, because I didn't do something right, its my fault I guess letting myself hurt myself, but I grew up thinking you do something wrong you get hit. I can remember fine details from years ago, but if you want to know what I did today or yesterday or a week ago, can't really remember. Days blend in like that, making it hard to know what you did on Monday when its actually Friday. 


My body hurts, all over, my joints, my ankles and feet hurt if I stand up too long, my back of my legs are sore always, knees are weird, they sometimes lock up sometimes just hurt out painfully or just be sore. My back and shoulders are bad from my posture, I've been doing better at sitting up. My lower back hurts almost everyday and it could down into my butt and to my legs. Some of this can be led to falling out of a tree or other past traumas such like sleeping in a computer chair because I dint have a bed, I'd curl up into a ball and sleep for a good time, funny thing is I got good sleep from it.

Everything is collapsing, it feels. 

Not taking any meds right now, they stopped working and the other ones had weird effects on my body. Psych doc is suppose to call me, but hasn't in a few weeks, probably just busy. 

Work is drug testing, just creates high tension, but it shouldn't be a problem if they see mj, just have to stop (which I was trying to do anyway). Tired of work though, losing passion for technology and computers, the one thing i'm good at. It happened to me and 3d animation, was decent at that, but just gave it up one day and never came back. I fear it's happening again. Having negative social experiences lately, I just feel I don't fit in anywhere, like usual. Should change jobs, but do I even want to do stuff in technology anymore? Do I start my own business, and in what? I feel like i'm good, but nothing great, just able to connect dots easily. I hate when people say I'm smart, I really wonder what makes me fuckin smart, because I feel like a dumbfuck most of the time. 

Can't really meet anyone, allergic to alcohol, so I try to avoid it. Don't know where to go to meet other people. Don't know how to talk to them, I lose interest, some people just cause a spark while others are just...dull light of anything. Something attracts me to other people, but I can't figure what it is. Most people seem to enjoy me, but I have problems enjoying them. But some people just click, I don't know why. Tried online as well, pretty much no responses, which is usual. 

School was a mess this semester, couldn't keep focus and meds wore off, so that just screwed everything up. If I tried a little harder, I could have passed. But I probably will have to retake it next semester, yay. Stupid fuck up. 

Living alone recently (about 6-7 months in). Time flys, I'm still trying to adjust, but my house just keeps piling up it seems. Can get a roomate, but I like being alone, I drain so easily in groups, and I feel I need to trust my roomate. Getting more into debt. Bills aren't horrible, just need to make a little more money. Don't really have much money for food, but that's fine, I don't really eat much anymore again. 

Sleeps just fucked, I tire around 5am for some stupid reason, and it's cruel because I need to wake for work at 6am, so it's not even worth it. Getting few hours of sleep, maybe 2-4 a day, 1-2 naps. Mind cannot stop, but body is so fucking tired. 

Lovely, suicidal thoughts are back again, the negative thoughts are back, just lost, no real purpose, no real goals, no real relationships, no passion. I've been defeated. Is it time I step down?

Sigh, this house of cards is falling, I can keep it up, but for how long. It's just a mask. Is it even worth it? I treat relationships and attention like drugs, the feelings they invoke are unlike any other (probably oxytocin, I don't like when people touch me unless i'm involved with them). It's quite a high, but I always try to stay away from them. It's almost uncontrollable, and when I go on a low, it's just dark chaos. I know it's a problem, but I don't know how to fix it. It would probably fix some problems, but I haven't had much luck in the last 6 years. I never really did in the first place.

For about two weeks I basically couldn't function despite being on medication for over a year now - 200mg Lamictal. The episode was on par with some of the episodes I had before I was diagnosed. I missed work and got suspended for two weeks. Now I'm cut back to working three days a week. It's going to be a struggle to pay my bills. I'm open about my disorder with my boss, and that was our compromise. I'll be able to get more hours once I demonstrate that I can consistently work my current schedule.

Thankfully before I got too deep into it I scheduled an appointment with my doctor. As it happened, I was nearly out of the rut by the time the appointment rolled around. My doctor and I spent nearly an hour discussing my mood pattern lately. She wanted to change my medication to Depakote, but changing medications takes a long time, and I don't think I can make it through without losing my job, or losing hours and not being able to pay rent. 

In the end we decided that I would try out Paxil. I've heard mostly positive things about it and my doctor seemed confident that it's a good thing for my situation. I've also heard, however, that many people experience negative side effects such as lower sex drive and the dreaded weight gain. 

I'd like to hear some of your experiences with Paxil. It might just be the post-depression mania kicking in, but I feel really confident about getting back to a stable position again.

I have a close family member who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around a year ago. She was hospitalized (I took her to the psych ward) after she was having suicidal ideations. She was diagnosed and put on medications. She struggled with them at first, but seemed to be getting the hang of them (I can't say she was perfect with them, the side effects really bothered her a lot.)

Fast forward to this week. I seemed like she was a little off. She blew up my phone because a friend cancelled on her for dinner. I tried consoling her, but to little avail. Today, I came home and she's visibly drunk (always had a problem with substance abuse. We didn't know how much it wasn't in her control until the diagnosis.) 

Through conversation she admitted to me that she had stopped taking her medication. When I asked, for how long? She responded for a long time. She wouldn't give me an exact timeframe. I know I have to take her mental state in mind, but I'm assuming she is telling the truth. Her argument with me was that I hadn't noticed a change in her behavior til today, so she must be doing fine. While that was untrue, I figured the mood swings were slight and I know the medication is not perfect, so I attributed it to that.

My question is, what do I do now? Should I take her back to the hospital? The only thing holding me back is she just got a full time job, and I'm afraid if I take her there that she'll lose it. The first time I took her to the psych ward, she was working in a job where my best friend was the boss so she was able to get the whole week off no questions asked while she was recuperating.

Thank you for listening and I apologize for the poor writing. It's 2am and I'm really out of options with what to do. I feel like every available option is a catch 22.

Okay about me: Female 19 Bipolar 1 Mixed Episodes.

Pretty young yep, mother, brother, grandfather, grandmother every bloody person in the family has it and surprise surprise so do I. (Saw 7 doctors, two disagreed, saying it was depression/anxiety, other five new me and my family history so it wasn't a shocker)

Okay so I want to start this by saying I fucking hate bipolar. I legitimately would punch it in the nuts if I could. It friggen ruins my days sometimes. Im on Cymbalta 60mg and Epilim (sodium Valporate) 600mg (I weigh 37kg and I am 145cm tall, have pancreatitis and the blood tests and constant appointments I have to go through drive me fucking insane)

The reason I am writing this whole thing is because sometimes I scroll through Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr (occasionally Reddit) and see the endless posts, blogs, tweets, messages etc about bipolar. I know, I know, every one is entitled to freedom of speech sometimes people need help and this is how they get it, they want to remove the stigma of mental illness etc. Yeah I get it. I'm not here because of that. I'm here for the attention seekers. The ones who romanticize this, the ones who write whole blogs on the ""struggles"" they are facing. The struggles which are nearly word for word the symptoms from WebMD.  The ones who literally have no clue of what it's like. I struggle trying to find the words now to describe my daily life and the emotional bloody roller coaster I have to ride every day. Fuck I think everyone in my life would find it hard to write what they think I'm experiencing. I see the way they look at me sometimes. I see the way I act. I know the ridiculous shit I do when I'm in a state and it's fucking shit. 

**THIS IS SHIT.** Not only that but those who write these blogs say that medication that they've taken for **ONE WHOLE DAY** is stupid and doesn't work and cripples them and it's not the one they need. Man I would marry my meds if I could. I would buy them a ring and get down on one knee and propose, goddamn they are my saving grace (sorry family you are amazing but damn these meds just get me) Now I'm not saying it's easy, it's hard to find a combination of drugs that fit together and work for you and if you've found that combination then you know exactly how I feel.

I just want people to know this illness is not fun, it's not romantic and it sure as hell is nothing to be bragging and one upping others with. Sure you don't have to be serious about it all the time you can make jokes about it and realize it's not your entire life, but it's not something people should want. I wouldn't want anyone to have this, even the highs are not worth it, so why do people have to romanticize it to a point where it's seen as something worth dying for?

He doesn't seem comfortable with diagnosing me with ANYTHING without a second opinion, but he's told me that a lot of what I've said fits the bill for bipolar or at least severe depression, and that I'd be a good candidate for medication to, quote, ""end the suffering.""

That was strange. It still is strange. 

No one else in my life seems to have ever noticed quite how out of my mind I can get. I'm usually really good at keeping quiet, or at least manageable as a friend and a daughter, and now that I'm bringing up questions of depression with my parents, they don't believe me. No one else in my life has ever called it ""suffering,"" because really, what do I have to suffer THROUGH? No one can see the ball of tension in my chest when I get anxious or the ridiculous urge to scream and throw things when I get upset. I've just never acted on it - ever. It's like playing popcorn: the game kids play on trampolines, trying to keep curled in a ball as long as they can while other people bounce them around trying to make them ""pop."" Until now, I've never popped. I would literally sit still for five or ten minutes at a time thinking over and over something like ""the next move I make sends this phone through the TV"" and thinking about all the reasons that would be a mad thing to do, and so finally the frustration starts to dissipate and I put the phone down. I'm 18 years old and I don't think I really know what it feels like to be normal, because morbidly depressed/suicidal and complete bliss have been my ""normal"" for so long.

I never realized that what I was going through was out of the ordinary until I saw this therapist, and he comforted me by saying ""not everyone has the ability to talk themselves through something like that."" My mom's been trying to talk me back out of it by saying ""you're the most hormonal now that you will ever be in your life"" and ""you're a teenager - this is just a phase and you'll get past it"" and I want to believe her, but I just don't anymore. 

I'm pretty much done with wanting to drown myself in the kitchen sink and then two days later making plans to travel around the world. I have just never acted on any of it - I have a good thinking brain in my head and I know what's reasonable and what's not - and I think that's why nobody seems to believe me when I finally confess how I've felt for so many years. They haven't noticed because there was usually nothing to notice.

I apologize sincerely for the long post but there's no one else I can really talk to and that thought has been haunting me for awhile: that there's nobody to give me advice about it. 

I'm hoping that my therapist will call soon to set up an appointment with me AND my parents and maybe get this sorted out but since he said he'd call yesterday, I'm starting to worry.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Hospital trips. Then things balanced out for awhile. They were okay. Not good. But okay. This year I lost two family members, my aunt and her 4 year old child. And my entire family has been grieving. And I've been struggling to keep things together, but it seems like the more I try the more she doesn't. She's quick to anger. Because of the nature of her work, we get up at 4 am. I drive us to my work (we are staying with my relatives until our new apartment is ready) and then she drives from there. Early morning meltdowns are common. Today was the worst yet. 

She's on lamictal. Her horrid Kaiser doctor doesn't seem to know what meds she's on half the time. Tries to just throw different stuff at us even constantly. I know that's the state of modern psychiatric medicine but I'm more afraid of what the new meds will do. she was out of work for about 3/4 a year ago because of effexor. Despite my questions and suggestions that all her problems seemed to be listed side effects of effexor, her arrogant and uncaring kaiser hack wouldn't listen until HE decided. Which caused her months of anguish, confusion, and at one point a total fugue state where I had to chase her blocks through the city we lived in because she had no idea who I was or who she was. I'm terrified a new med will just do the same.

Therapy isn't an option. Kaiser only offers it once every 6 weeks, or groups, where someone quiet like my girlfriend normally is gets shunted to the back by all the loud mouth attention seeking patients. 

She's switching health plans in January. But I need help getting us there. I honestly am lost. It's 530 am. I'm covered in the coffee she just chucked at me because she couldn't find her cigarettes, and she's calmed down and gone to work. Everyone just says leave her, including her. But that's not an option. I love her, and she can be the biggest ray of sunshine in my life (I suffer from depression and ADHD myself) when she's good. On top of that she has no one. Her dad lives over seas. Her closest relative didn't even bother to check in on her her last hospital visit before we met. They were her emergency contact and they didn't bother. How could I let her adrift on her own? I don't even know how people who love others can even say this.

We're walking plague bags filled mostly with bacteria that floats sinks and swims within the murky water that permeates our bodies. If you attend the right groups and only say things others agree about you'll find yourself filled to the brim with the right kinds of diseases, the ideas that settle themselves somewhere inside your brain, the ones that sound a bit like chin up or you only live once. The symptoms are visible in the eyes, you have to look for that unwavering confident gaze beaming happy thoughts, coating everything with optimism. Receive inocculation through reading too much or listening to the wrong kind of music and you come dangerously close to seeming like a junkie. The kind of junkie that shuns the daylight, spending his time in the mute company of instant messages and forum posts and the disemodied experience that is online- become your screen name with all the other addicts just like you separated by what you come to think of as merely physical distance.

This will not do if you wish to partake of the buzzing mutual dream that has something to do with sex and laughter and bright colors. Let the dubstep shake your spine release all those pent up fluids melt with all the others in the bright sensory overload of screaming nightclubs. Close proximity to your fellow desperate inmates is an ample breeding ground for the right kinds of viruses. Be a spoke in the wheel of the cycle where the ideas are born online seep into peoples lives through the screens they carry and out their mouths and into your ears and behind your eyes till all your other errant thoughts are persecuted for the vandals and rioters that they are. Do not call them terrorists the irony gives them power. Call them the boring and the depressed and most of all the negative, like those ancient photo film negatives where the black became white and the white pretended to be black. 

Positivity is the only kind of terminal cancer worth cultivating. Let the tumors grow, harvest the moments record them with your phones reproduce them online infinitely without mass so they can reach through to all your fellow inmates and you can all bask in the new happy moments you think you had are sure you had because the rioters tell you they read online that memory is mutable and quite easily faked. When it gets too much and you're forced within the ten minutes of quiet you have every day onto the couch or the seat and your screen is out of energy and the silence invades you rapes your boredom and your mind twists and turns on the bitter pills it concocted then when that happens be sure to count the minutes and hold on hold on till the phone recharges or someone messages you or some notification reminds you to make your next move. Always sink yourself within the soma always have a game on hand to murder the spare minutes and prevent idle thoughts from accumulating and attempting to attack those happy diseases you sucked up or allowed to crawl into your skin.

Admire from afar the works of spectacle the celebrations of what could be in this new technological utopia. Hate the right bankrupt institutions above all agree with the others, and embrace limited subjectivity of opinion. Everyone is entitled to not care about the same things. Take personal pride in the works of others and the five minutes on the screen that amuses you these dreams of inmates that decorate your life you somehow helped you know it- that disease is the best one, they used to call it progress. Prevent sentences too long from coalescing. Butcher words, reduce them to acronyms, say the same thing as briefly as possible several times a day- that's your prescription, your prescribed socializing as you do your deiligent repetitive duty to infect all the people you're supposed to love. You know what love is you let the downloaded TV shows and downloaded autotuned songs teach you in bitsized easily recalled phrases whilst you wait inbetween. 

Images tower over the language, the language is a tool of negativity. The other words, the shadow world, analogue and difficult to define or joke about invades- keep it at bay, keep it on the news feeds, the distant troubles of other countries and other peoples who die and rape for progress for an accessory or a gadget a new way to kill a few more seconds every day. The world whispers online we might all be immortal soon, so nevermind death it's not like you have to accept a facebook invite to funerals. If you collate the right kinds of images you can craft the right kind of narrative about your life before now past but pristinely modifiable online- remind yourself when it tries to scream of all the good times you had and need to have again, must have again lest the silence come, and grab hold of you. 

If all else fails resort to the small, embossed, tasteless octagons, the cylinders, the oblong pills you wash down with glittering beverages. The medicine will kill the misery dead, will silence the wailing and smother the bells that ring inside your head. 

Walk and stand and wait with all the rest, admire all the different colors and different brands and different bags with similar screens with similar words, all of it evidence for freedom. Plug freedom into your ear, fret when you disconnect and hear the horning cars the crying children the pleading beggers that pretend things aren't better than they've ever been and will soon be best. Inhale the smog, the orange nightlight fog that allows you the space to get completely drunk and be irritated and every moment wasted, not gratified, every minute spent waiting for the lie, or the virus, or the message, all the messages the words on the walls and in the halls that promise you they know what you need. 

There is an answer to every question you'll ever dare to ask, and the answer is brief.

If for some reason you will not react to the guilt you feel properly, if you cannot deal with this symptom of progress, then retreat. Leave the others to their jeering and cheering, be envious of all the sex they must have, of all the good memories they earned, and find a room to call your own online with others who share the same rare disease as you. Find forums and games and type out your passions, you must be so passionate about your subculure, your hobby, find the others. There are always others. Do not feel lonely, feel guilty for being lonely. You just need to just find the right disease. If you fail to contract the right disease, if you do not swallow the pills, if you leave yourself inside your room and use the online oracle and receive no satisfactory answers and will not admit the truth they tell you that it's you you're broken you're defective you cannot be returned your warranty is void then we prescribe the occasional secret, sultry, onanistic pleasure- take your keyboard, your camera, your guitar, your code and create something, anything at all, the final disease is that you are unique and you can find a space online to share your uniqueness with all the rest, if you strive hard enough and release enough words, enough music, enough images to the right commentators then perhaps one day you'll fill five minutes of a stranger's life with spectacle, and then you'll finally feel like patient zero, like the mad scientist, the successful business man, the self-starting artist who made a difference and you'll sleep sounder, you'll cry less, you'll have taken a scalpel made of rare earth metals and cut out your gangrenous deformity. 

For everyone else to ooh and aah at for five minutes. 

If none of the above work jump off your fucking balcony and finally transition into the statistic you've always been.

I am hoping, at least, that I will be judged less harshly here than I might over at /r/offmychest! Also hoping this makes sense and doesn't just come out as a jumble.

For some brief background - I'm mid-20's, married to my partner of nearly 10 years, and was formally diagnosed with bipolar just a few years ago. In hindsight, and in discussion with family, friends and old doctors, I should have been diagnosed correctly when I was 12.

My hypersexuality is straining my marriage, and I'm totally lost. Before I met my husband, I put myself in all kind of unsafe sexual situations. When we met, and I had a stable, supportive influence in my life, I got 'better'. My mood swings seemed normal for someone my age, the best way I can put it is that my illness turned 'mild' to the point where I didn't think there was anything wrong with me after all. I spent 7 years without medication, and was doing really well!  
Then I had a pretty major manic episode, which led to my eventual diagnosis. I spent some time in hospital to get some meds sorted, started therapy again and had a wonderful husband who supported me through all of it. I've gone through a few manic/depressive cycles since then (I tend to cycle every 6-8 months), and my current manic episode is what's breaking me. Usually when I'm manic and hypersexual, I just masturbate constantly and can slightly sate my appetite. This time is different. I have recently accepted that I am a sexual masochist, so often require emotional or physical pain to get me off. I have spoken to my husband about this, and he has tried to hurt me the way I need it, but the fact is that he isn't a sadist - and there is no way I can fault him for that!

When I found out that a long-time friend of ours was also recently diagnosed with bipolar, I was over the moon! I finally had someone IRL to talk to, this is awesome! Then I found out that he was also diagnosed as a sexual sadist (also hypersexual), and shit changed. I became insatiable, all I could think about was 'holy shit, I have finally found a sadist that I know enjoys doing the things I enjoy'. It was like my mania shot through the roof, just on the basis of finding this out about my friend. My sleeping patterns were fucked, I started masturbating upwards of 15-20 times a day, and I started getting more erratic and violent towards myself - imagining my friend was doing it to me. Then we fucked.  
My friend came over to drink with me while my husband was out, we somehow ended up in bed and it was fucking wonderful. It wasn't until the next morning when I woke up covered in bruises that I kind of took stock of what I did and was terrified. At least I'm a massive klutz, so I told my husband that I was falling over shit and walking into tables and he bought it. I started hating myself for what I did, and became concerned that maybe I was just using hypersexuality as an excuse for being a dirty, cheating slut. Then we did it again a few weeks later. Then an ex-girlfriend started texting me, and now we're flirting. And then an ex-boyfriend started texting and now we're flirting. And then the sadist was over here the other night, and I blew him as soon as my husband went to work. All I can think of is fucking, and I don't know how to control it!

I think it partially has to do with an unfulfilled sex life (2-3 times a week, where I could easily go 2-3 times a day), along with my disorder. I actually approached my husband about non-monogamy after the first time I fucked my friend, but found that I couldn't wait for an answer... I'm still waiting for that answer, and I don't know what I'll do if he says no. I apparently can't control myself as it is, but if he can't/won't agree to it, I'm scared that I'm going to have to keep lying to him and will end up fucking people behind his back until my next depressive episode. Is it sick that I want to be suicidal again because I know at least my sex drive will disappear? The only meds I have found that quash the hypersexuality force me into a depression, so I can't see that working out too well for my doctors.

**TL;DR** Found out I am sexually well-matched to a friend (bipolar and sadomasochist), which triggered my mania into overdrive, and my hypersexuality is close to reaching boiling point. Cheated on my husband, probably going to do it again and feeling like a giant piece of shit. Keep trying to convince myself that I am 'in control', when I know I'm probably not... totally and utterly lost.","['pobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

Recently, however, in the last month I've been having dreams in which I'm experiencing very charged emotions, and a lot of anger. 

A few dreams really stick out..one of them takes place in my bedroom. I get up from my bed, look out the window, and suddenly I experience my heart sinking in sorrow. Then I feel absolutely euphoric, then furious, then panicked, and then the process repeats itself a few times. In this dream, there is no reason for these intense, full body mood swings. There is nothing out the window, but the view of my neighbour's tree, just like in my waking life.

A few others have been of little things happening in my dream, after which I completely lose my temper, screaming with uncontrollable rage; wanting to tear everyone and everything apart. In these dreams, I'm furious and inconsolable.

I guess I'd consider these nightmares...though I'm not sure if they represent a fear of losing control of my emotions after being stable for some time now, or a reflection of how I still really feel inside.

I know that this might be kind of vague, since I haven't really added much detail of my life, but my life isn't very stressful as it stands currently. I'm definitely going to mention it to my psychiatrist, but I'm not sure if she can do much since my medications have been balancing me out quite well as of lately...maybe talk to a therapist?

I've been in and out of BP2 treatment for the better part of 15 years now. What I've learned in that time is that things can get better, but they never get **good**.

I went to a free meditation course, and got hooked on it. I went to at least 2 scripture readings per week, and on short retreats as well. I'd sit on my cushion and meditate for 40-60 minutes per day. I consumed every book I could find about Buddhism and the practice. Having grown up Catholic (and hating it), it was a real jolt to, in my 30s, find a new road that seemed to make perfect sense. But this all just *clicked* for me.

The problem is that if I do so much as cut my Seroquel in half, it all goes away. Then I'm back to ruining friendships, ruining relationships, ruining jobs, ruining my family life. Inside of 3 days.

My peace, my calm, my drive/ability to sit on that cushion and calm the mind.... GONE. And benefits I might have realized while practicing, disappeared 

Is there a reason for a bipolar person to make that kind of investment in meditation and the path when all of your efforts will burn to the ground every time your meds stop working or get switched or you stop taking them altogether.

Does it make sense to read/sit/meditate myself into a more calm and sympathetic place in my head if my brain can only handle and retain it when the perfect storm of pharmas are being pumped into my brain.

I had taken on a bunch of additional assignments due to my hard-working nature and for a change of pace.

I'm less than two years from paying off my student loans and I wanted to accelerate the process so I was interviewing at different places for another part time job to make more money.  I was also frustrated that despite doing more work and taking on more responsibilities than my more senior coworkers I still had not received a promotion or raise; although praise had been given and promises made.

I was really tired from my long work days, the search for a second job, and general life frustrations so I decided to get some medicinal health. I purchased some Adderall and vitamins to help overcome my tiredness. Around this same time, I had my annual physical and I was found to have developed hypothyroidism and uric crystals.

I was promptly put on thyroid medication to help with my tiredness and on the side I took my non-prescribed Adderall. I know now that it was a stupid thing to do but hindsight is 20/20 and I felt like my medical knowledge was sufficient for what I was doing.

The adderall brought about some latent anxiety that I forgot I had and on top of that pushed me into a manic state. At work, my productivity soared but my mind was overwhelmed. I had trouble talking to my coworkers and frequently and rudely interrupted conversations or spoke way too fast.

Long story short  I began having all the symptoms of burnout and my coworkers became quite nervous about my behavior so insinuated I should leave. Whenever I was around people would discuss changing jobs, craziness, mood swings, and their experiences firing people. I had people suggest I move on and many of my coworkers started heckling me including my brand new manager. I couldn't take it anymore and at the advice of my boyfriend I changed my cell phone number and stopped going into work.

I feel soooo much better having removed the stress from my life and I've returned to therapy to help with my depression. I realize now that I should not have taken medications not prescribed or overseen by a medical professional.

We talked about ultradian bipolar and I have to say that my days are so up and down that at the end of them, I have no idea what to think of them. I've since been started on Depakote, which worked very well at first but lately doesn't seem to help. We took the SSRI out, but I was feeling exceptionally depressed after about a month of that, so Wellbutrin was added in. The other meds stayed the same.

Once again, this was great for about a week or two.
Now I see the obvious symptoms. The complete total downs and total manic ups of my days that switch so frequently that it just runs me down. My boyfriend of three years recognizes changes in my behavior but assumes I am not taking my meds, or my sleep schedule is off by my choice (it's not by choice) and that's the issue.

When I get to my Dr.'s office, I really have to think hard about what to ask him before hand. It's not cheap to go (as you all know) and he was hesitant to put me on Lamictal before. I'm mostly curious as to how many of you identify with the ""Ultradian Bipolar"" type. Everyone around me thinks I'm just moody. But I can truly go from 30 minutes of bliss and mania to the deepest, darkest feelings I've ever felt with no reason and nothing that ""set me off"".

I wanted nothing to do with this hospitalization. I had to beg my mom to keep me and not kick me out over it. It was the longest stay yet and the most radical med changes. It even caused seizures. My seizure medication is now two instead of one.

I have been told a few times by my mom that it's all in my head, but little comments here and there tell me it's not.

I. lost. my. mind. It didn't matter how much they upped the dose. Hell, the higher the dose, the worse I got. The panic attacks, the rages, the cutting, the crying....all of it got worse. I started sleeping in cemeteries and driving all-nighters cross country. I stopped the medications, thinking the doctors were wrong since the meds didn't help. I didn't accept the bipolar diagnosis for a long time...until just this past year, really. After all, I improved dramatically when I got away from the bad environment/relationships that put me in outpatient services to begin with. I accepted the ADD (there was no denying that...I'm so shiny I'm blinding), but didn't treat for it, save for a few half-hearted attempts every couple years.

Even when I met my husband, I told him, ""In the name of honesty, I have been diagnosed bipolar. I am unmedicated and fine, though, so it was obviously a mistake."" Over the years, he watched me and realized that I was, indeed, bipolar. I still denied it, blaming my behavior on stress and my ADD. He just kept picking up the pieces when he could, fighting his own depression, and I helped him when I could. We made it through me caring for my grandfather for a year and a half until he succumbed to Alzheimer's, my husband's unemployment (during a pregnancy, no less), a couple miscarriages and infertility, and a foreclosure before I finally had a breakdown so bad that, even though he picked me up again, he pushed me to get help. He reminded me that we had a three year old, and a nine year old with diabetes, ADHD, and autism. Even though I only work two days a week, our house is a wreck. Mountains of clothes, dishes never done, some rooms you can't even see the floor (although sadly, this is an improvement over our last place). He did agree with me that I was making some pretty good improvements; I had started to tackle the clutter and was throwing lots of stuff out. I had interacted with some friends, and was showing my true worth at work, and had even remained functional through my depressive cycles.

But I still had a lot of work to do. Social interaction causes me great anxiety before and after, no matter how fun it is. I can never truly feel ""safe"" at work because I don't trust anyone...except my husband. Well, I trust him more than anyone else, anyway. The littlest scuffle with my kids sets me off, and I would cry and cry over how I'd lost my temper with them. I was starting to hear things. It started off as muffled sounds, like a tv or radio that never turned off. It eventually turned to footsteps and voices (As a creative release, I actually based a scary story off of them on nosleep...most of that never happened. But it was oddly therapeutic). I was freaking out over odd occurrences; unfamiliar keys keep turning up in odd places. The oddest of which was my LOCKED car...two just appeared in my cup holder. Who knows how they got there...but my reaction was out of proportion. And even though I was keeping my shit together at work (I work mostly alone), I was breaking down and/or having a drink or two when I would get home.

So I spoke with my doctor, who started me on depakote. He told me how bad it had been that they had started me on the stimulants and the antidepressant without first stabilizing me. And here we are a month later, with some slight improvement, ready to up the dose and maybe add in something.

Now for where my oldest comes in. Lately, she has been acting strange. Stranger than normal. She is going from happy-go-lucky to violently angry in a split second. She's not sleeping. The teacher says she's either giddy or furious at school. She's threatening self harm and harm to others. She's doing dangerous things in regards to her diabetes...only thing that saves her is that we monitor her so closely since she is still so young. She's always done things like this, but not to this degree. After four years of having bipolar as a ""to be ruled out"" diagnosis, I was positive that there was no ruling it out. Yesterday, the psychiatrist agreed and made the diagnosis official, and we start her on abilify today. Apparently there are no FDA approved drugs for bipolar in children...so this is what we have. 

I am so afraid for her. She has started so much earlier than I did, with so many more issues. And self-harm and/or suicide would be so much easier for her. She has an insulin pump, and it takes mere seconds to dial in and administer a dose high enough to kill her. Despite my best efforts, her and I just cannot bond the same way I am bonded with my youngest. I blame both myself (she was unplanned and I was in a bad state when she was young) and her own issues (autism, difficulty communicating, disliking physical closeness, etc) with our troubles. I hate to say it, but there are days when I am stonily preparing myself to outlive her...telling myself that she could lose it and kill herself at any time and trying to protect myself...even as I am trying so hard to save her...and even as I sometimes have suicidal thoughts myself. I admit that I have at one point thought that her and I should go out together, leaving my husband and younger daughter to an easier life. I am fairly sure little one is NT, or at least closer to NT, as by this age, we knew my oldest had problems. 

I know I never would hurt her, but having those thoughts hurts me. I worry that she will hurt my little one, who is very tiny in stature. Big sister loves her dearly, but there is definitely some jealousy there, and she can see how much easier it is for my little one to be the bell of the ball wherever we go.



Whew. Sorry. I could go on...but I really shouldn't. I needed to just get enough out to get right...if I go on too long, I'll come right back around to being upset. Thanks for reading all of that, if anyone is still with me here. ","['dobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

Previously before I was diagnosed as BP1 I was placed on Wellbutrin, the side effects were minimal until it threw me into a manic episode. Shortly after I was placed on a low dose of Lithium but that caused a violent allergic reaction: Seizures, Tightness of chest, vomiting, ect. Afterwards I was put on 1000mg of Depakote in the evening along with the Wellbutrin at 150mg 2 times a day. That cocktail helped subside the episodes but shortly stopped working, plus the fact that I felt like I wasn't the same on it. I was hospitalized twice for depressive episodes and should have been for a manic episode, and then was bounced around from most of the SSRIs and a few MAOIs. After my PDOC retired I was given another who switched me to 150mg of Effexor a day on top of 10mg of Abilify for psychosis. That too worked for a little bit but exacerbated symptoms as well as horrible side effects and I took myself off of the meds in March. After THAT PDOC retired (see the trend?), my new PDOC dropped the Depakote. and after about 3 weeks I went into a manic episode along with some bad side effects.
I'm worried about if they can find something that works. To be honest, the best was when I was off of all meds, aside from the psychosis. Even that was a lot tougher then I thought it would be. I know that Wellbutrin will make me manic if I don't have a mood stabilizer, but the mood stabilizer side effects make life suck so much. The same goes with Effexor. All the medication that I have been on the past 4 years has either not worked, worked for a little, or work but have such bad side effects it makes me stop taking them.

As of the past few years, my dad's gone through hell and it just keeps getting worse. Type 2 diabetes, spinal surgery, broken kneecap/thumb, heart attack, etc. In August he just snapped, and we ended up having to commit him for several days due to what happened.

Immediately I feared that it was Bipolar Disorder. My father refused to acknowledge anything was wrong with him, and refused to get checked out.

For the past few weeks, he's been acting unusual. My family was just waiting for another snap. When he went to his doctor yesterday for his monthly check-up, HE brought up to the doctor that he felt crankier. Him admitting that he has a problem was a huge step for everyone in the house.

So the doctor gave him the option of Abilify or Seroquil. The general responses to Google are, quite honestly, real fucking scary. With Abilify I saw most people experienced increased heart rate and palpitations. With Seroquil I saw some people slept the entire day away.

Due to his other risk factors, Seroquil would seem like the best option for him - but he's not going to take it if it turns him into a zombie or he sleeps the day away. I only saw a few people mention that they adjusted to Seroquil and their sleep schedule is fine.

So, opinions and/or experiences?

Also, something I'm confused about. I didn't go with to the doctor's appointment yesterday, but by being prescribed antipsychotics, does this mean that the doctor agrees/believes that there is something out of the ordinary going on with my father? Or are these just commonly prescribed medications?",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

This is my first post here with this account.  I am recently diagnosed Bipolar 2 and am still wrestling with lots of the fallout from that revelation.  So many things in my past make much more sense, and hopefully my new meds, once titrated properly will help... (?)

Anyway, the last couple days in particular have been REALLY bad.  I shared this writing with my wife, but I think it would be good for me to put it out there for others who can understand.

One quick note.  My wife and I have three young daughters.  That information may help some of this make sense.

--------------------------

**5:30 AM**

It's 5:30 AM. Sleep sounds like a mercy but it won't come. Too many thoughts. Too many worries. Too many uninvited whispers of loss, of grief, of fear. Fear of things that aren't even real. Fear of things that are nothing more than a construct of my own making. 

What if I never see one of them again? What if this silent moment watching them sleep is the last one given to me? What then? How could these bleak days possibly continue when all my mind feeds me are thoughts of the sole lights in my darkness being snuffed out like so many candles? 

Surely, true loss would be infinitely harder, infinitely more difficult to bare... But try as I may, I cannot convince myself of it when you already feel like every wall is closing in around you and all your previous truths are now just confused questions...

Why, God? Why? I trust you, I do. I think I do. I tell myself I do. And I mean it when I say it. But why? And how? Because I honestly don't know. How do you live a life that feels like it belongs to someone else. A life where you have been recast in your own role. 

The people, the places, the things around me are familiar, are my foundation and my heart. But why don't I feel at ease in their presence. Why don't I feel like my story is my story, but the story of a broken and shattered specter of who I thought myself to be? 

It's 6 AM now... I am crying and I have no idea why. I just know it won't stop. 

I'm just so scared of losing those I love, and the weight of it crushes upon me like a tidal wave. 

Why? Everything is fine, as far as I can tell. 

Everything but me. Everything but what's going on in my mind. 

6:15 now. I feel better now, I guess? I have no idea honestly. Perhaps a brief, merciful moment of retreating shadows? 

What will my dreams bring, I wonder? More worrisome, what about what comes after the dreams? 

Why? 
How?

It's worked really well but I've realized that the last two months I've actually been pretty depressed. Another disturbing development is that a couple of times I had overwhelming suicidal urges where it's not your standard suicidal ideation, it's like let's do it now type thoughts. The first time this happened I was in a lecture and I was figuring out how I could kill myself after the lecture in the same building - like within the hour kind of urgency. 
In almost ten years with bipolar disorder I have had suicidal thoughts all the time but I've never ever experienced this before. I don't experience this urges continuously it's just the odd time. 



I still haven't called my psychiatrist because I feel like the only options are lithium or antidepressants. It seems like antidepressants do more harm than good for most people and lithium doesn't have such good press either (plus I have a phobia of blood tests).
So my first question is, what do you think my psychiatrist will be able to offer me?



Secondly, my options are likely either request an urgent appointment (actually they might even have called it an emergency appointment last time I tried to get my appointment moved forward) or wait a month for an appointment (probably). I feel like I'm in risky territory at the moment and a month is far too long to wait however under no circumstances do I want to mention the suicide thing. This would make the urgent appointment look a bit strange and I'm not sure how I'd explain my way out of that. I don't want it written down anywhere in case they decided I was suicidal there and then and that they should alert next of kin or something (not actually sure what they do in an 'emergency' like that..). So my second question is should I go for the urgent appointment or not?



These kind of urges are incredibly disturbing and causing quite a bit of anxiety but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm actually in any real danger, my chances of actually doing something stupid may well be miniscule. Can any bipolar veterans confirm that this could be the case? Considering at no point in the past ten years have I made a single concrete step towards a plan or even decided on an exact plan I suspect this could be the case - just one more delusion thanks to bipolar disorder. 


**Tl;dr medication stopped working, bouts of overwhelming suicidal urges.**


**Edit: Thanks guys, I've made an appointment to discuss my options. I really hate having to talk to doctors but it sounds like it could be worth it. I Don't have an appointment until the 30th of April but I'm feeling miles better today so it doesn't seem so bad. During the week I was feeling about as bad as it gets so hopefully that's the end of that for a while!**",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader
