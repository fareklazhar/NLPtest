I have always been a glass half full individual and I have been in love with my long term girlfriend for almost 5 years. It is apparent that she has had anxiety/depression issues over these years. The primary trigger has always seemed to be her stressful job - but this is only a first position out of college. I hoped this would pass. There are days where she cannot leave the house or cannot even leave the bed.

These episodes could be very extreme so she (thankfully) began therapy and medication. It's been a roller-coaster of pharmaceutical cocktails and diagnoses ever since. Recently things seem to have honed in on a well defined diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. 

I try to be as supportive as I can. I think it's been very well appreciated. However, depression is the dominant cycle and I can't help but feel there is a constant cloud of negativity present in our household. It's slowly chipping away at my own psyche in a number of ways: limited social interaction, lessened physical activity, unsatisfactory sex life (I'm embarrassed to admit just how much this last one bothers me - I know it's not her fault...) I'm developing my own sense of anxiety related to some of the bigger questions looming in our future. Can we still get married and be happy? Move back to our hometown where our families are? Can we still have kids? Would it even be responsible to think about kids if this emotional environment can't be drastically improved?

I cannot imagine my life without my girlfriend but perhaps my idealistic vision of our future needs to be disregarded for the time being. I'm afraid to discuss how much some of these things are bothering me at this time because my sole focus is on helping improving her emotional state. I would hate to make the situation even worse and make her feel guilty for what is happening to me. The last thing I would want is to induce any anxiety that I am considering leaving (even if this dark thought does cross my mind from time to time.)

I hope this is an OK post to make here. I would really like to hear how other couples have dealt with a similar situation. ",['conj'],0,neu_vader

I highly lack motivation. I'm unsatisfied with my life but not doing anything anything to change it. I don't even know where to begin. The lack of interest isn't helping.

On one hand:
A friend of mine that lives a few states south east of me is planning to start a video game company. I've talked to him about for 6 months now. I've  given input, opinions,  and ideas. He considers me his partner.

I'm highly reluctant this business will gain footing. Definitely not a quality a business partner should have. While I have some schooling in programming , like math and Japanese. The lack of use has had time fade it all away. He too has some schooling in game design. He does have an associates in Marketing. 

Together we just don't have the knowledge and experience we are just two people with ideas. 
I'm here saying it's not going to work and he's all overly positive and believes we will become rich enough to live comfortably. Maybe call me a pessimist. I consider it being a realist. 

On the other hand:
I just recently started taking care of my nephews  before and after school. 11 year old takes care of himself is highly into Destiny on the Xbox one , barely goes outside. 7 year old he's a handful, but love him dearly. Has autism , loves to be outside. Easily angered/upset. 

Watching them always seems to be the back up plan. I watched them prior to working last year as I was jobless and also homeless I lived with them.before that it was after my break down in school in 07. 

Don't get me wrong I love my nephews but I just don't see myself doing it as a career. It does give me a little money to pay bills. I Moved out of there last April after my anxiety filled episode. Prior to that I was thinking I wasn't good enough to watch the kids. 

I now live with my parents AGAIN. I bounce back and forth between my brothers , my parents , and then trying to live on my own. 

I'm deathly afraid of getting a job. I fear I will repeat last year. I feel like I'm no good for any job. I fear I  just don't have the energy and will get fired anyways.  

I've been working with the states division of vocational rehabilitation. Not only am I bipolar, but comorbidly ADHD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder with social phobia. I like my counselor. I haven't seen her lately as we moved to the next step in me and my job consultant trying to find a volunteer position where I can be assessed in working. Not a bad plan, has me anxious. First time we met we talked about me my struggles my worries. Second time we met we worked on my resume. Third time got cancelled he was ill. 

We have been corresponding through email. He reached out to my job from last year HR contact I had who encourages me to reapply, BTW they are rehiring. The requirements have changed to require more experience. I apply anyways, to find out my application still exists in the system.

 My job consultant, then said to contact my recruite, which I did. She emailed me back, and said she'd call, but she hasn't.  While all this time I was really reluctant. I expressed my fears and he said we could just move on from this. I told him my fear of getting overwhelmed, not learning the job fast enough, not meeting standards were not just fears for that job, but for all jobs in general. That's where I'm At with that.

I keep getting asked what my goal for treatment is from both  my pdoc in my bipolar medication group which also has a small therapy element . I just started and gone twice. Then from my therapist. My answer is always something like to be better. For years. My therapist (2nd one in this clinic, 5th overall)now that I'm not in such a high panic state I think is trying to emphasize setting goals. I've never been good at that. Nor do I know what to set a goal for. I just don't want to be like this. Too afraid to work/live.

I don't even know what I'm asking for or expecting for a response. Any feedback would be great. I guess I just want to start some conversation about what's been going on. Someone to talk about it other than my therapist, job consultan, and couple friends.

TL;DR have two different job choices(one doesn't pay as of now), I'm not interested in anything fun, I just blabbed a lot of stuff. Any/All feedback is appreciated.",['compound'],0,neu_vader

Some say antidepressant induced hypomania is just that, and not grounds for a bipolar diagnosis. Others talk about those who experience hypomania while taking an antidepressant for Major Depressive Disorder means I'm on some kind of bipolar spectrum.

All I know is that I should really stay away from standard antidepressants because I get hypomanic then eventually crash. I've tried 4-5 different antidepressants in the past 6 years and it's always the case when starting a new antidepressant.

I also know that I've been seriously depressed since I was in high school, and looking back, in-between my depressive states I experienced subtle highs in my mood, but I'm not sure these highs in my mood qualify as hypomanic. I know they weren't as high as when I started taking antidepressants a number of years after high school.

I know I need to talk to a psychiatrist about all of this, but the psychiatrist I'm currently seeing only sees me for medication management, and I only see her once every 3 months for a follow up, and each follow up is 15-20 minutes long to determine if she should renew my prescription. So I know I have to look into seeing a different psychiatrist for a real sit down and talk.

I was just wondering what some of you guys thought about all this. Do I really need to see a psychiatrist to determine if I have bipolar II (for a more focused treatment plan if the Lamictal doesn't work out) or am I just one of those people who become hypomanic while on antidepressants with no underlying bipolar disorder?

Thanks. 

EDIT: I mention Bipolar II explicitly because I don't THINK I've ever gone full blown manic. I've never been hospitalized for any extreme behavior during my highs. I've just received comments in the past from friends and family about my mood. I've been asked if I was on drugs, or why am I so happy lately. I've been called annoying and have been told by family members that I need to calm down, but I don't think I've ever felt like I was a threat to myself or others. And, when the depression strikes again and I look back at how my behavior was, I KNOW that wasn't the real me.

It's not constant, or maybe I'm only noticing it when it's an issue. My general blinks has become a little more forceful, if that makes sense.

I believe this started a few months after I started taking lithium in June, but I'm only taking 600 mg so I'm a little surprised that a low dose would cause this.

Could this actually be medicine-related? Or is it just a habit I started? Or both?

The ADHD, ever since I got into doctoral school, has brought with it intense anxiety issues that have gotten worse and worse with every semester.  It got to the point this semester that I've even had panic attacks when I sit down to try and complete late assignments, I'm so scared and anxious.  When I'm not, I'm completely and utterly depressed about feeling like an utter sack of shit and not being able to function like a normal person.

Now, I never would have thought of bipolar disorder, but a friend of mine has apparently been dealing with it for years.  She knows me pretty well and says that she thinks I should go talk to the campus psychiatrist about the possibility, because she thinks I'm demonstrating the same kinds of cycles that she goes through.

I really don't have much experience with this, but I'm just scared as hell because it's one more frightening psychological burden to deal with.  I know that, if I have it, that I'm really treating it as a burden now by not dealing with it... but I feel like if I go to the doctor and I DO have it, then it becomes real.  Right now it just feels like a theory a friend of mine had, like it's not real.

Anyway, I'm sorry if I spoke of anything inappropriately or offended anyone, I'm just scared that I'm going to be adding one more lifelong psychological struggle to the battle that I fight every day.  I'm scared that I'm going to fail out of school and not get a job and my life is going to fall apart and everything is going to collapse around me.

Anyway, my friend isn't a doctor and neither am I, I just needed to vent...  If it turns out I DO have bipolar disorder, I might be coming by here more often.

**Decided to see shrink because my Dad is dying. Could use support**
I went to see a shrink because i needed someone to talk to. My father is dying and I am struggling with my Masters while being unemployed. I figured I needed a paid friend to ""hold my hand"" ( for want of a better term) through this difficult time. I was experiencing anxiety and mild depression, but nothing out of the ordinary - and certainly quite normal considering the stress I am dealing with.

**She asks me a series of questions including:**

Do I notice patterns?

Do I ever feel that everything is going to be OK?

Do I sing?

Have I ever had a mystical experience?

Does the Mayan Calendar have any special significance to me?

She then diagnoses me with Bipolar. 

**I question her** - how can she diagnose me with Bipolar from an arbitrary set of questions that are utterly unscientific?

She seemed affronted that I challenged her.

I countered. If I am Bipolar - certainly a blood test will ascertain whether I have a chemical imbalance?

**She notices me challenging her and then goes on to say.**

""Some of the the greatest artists in history have Bipolar. You are enhanced"".

**I really feel like she is trying to ""sell"" me Bipolar.** She wants me on lamitral which are anti seizure meds. I think this is rather drastic considering she has known me for less than two hours of my life. 


**Reddit, has your shrink ever told you that being Bipolar is being enhanced?**

I do not trust this diagnoses - and am reluctant to re-wire my brain with drugs based on her pseudo science questionnaire.

Some illumination would be great. Thanks!

Some background: I'm a university student home on break for Thanksgiving. I've been hypomanic for the past few weeks and despite medication increases (going from lamictal 100mg to 200mg and seroquel 25mg to 100mg), exercise, and eating right, I keep going up and up and up and up. I came home and was an absolute bitch to my family, argued with them about everything, and was extremely irritable. When I'm hypomanic it manifests itself on the internet too. I'm an activist of sorts and I start posting tons of shit on facebook related to things I advocate, but then I fear I'm alienating my friends and family. I guess I shouldn't give a fuck because that's just who I am, but the fact that these things reflect my mood kind of freaks me out. What's worse, I've started having delusional thinking about government conspiracies. It's really making me nervous. 

I smoke weed quite a bit, I find it very calming when I'm hypomanic and it brings me up when I'm depressed. Last night I got high and it made me feel normal. I started to realize how I've been acting and I got so furious with myself. I came home to my parents crying and apologizing for how I've been acting. They were very supportive but it still kills me inside to know that I hurt them. I'm also quite frightened about my sanity. I've been in denial of how bad my illness is getting. I need to find creative outlets so I don't keep flipping a shit at my loved ones. I think if I do something productive and creative in this state it will be awesome. So sometimes I'm grateful for being this way but at the same time I hate it. Do you guys feel this way?

The last few sticks are burning. 

I understand what I've done, and I understand how it sounds, but I haven't been fully in control of my actions, possibly since my mother died. 

I'm sorry. I am. All I can say is that I'm trying to learn and come to terms. But I'm threading a fine needle here, between learning what I have to do to make myself healthy and learning what I have to do make myself happy. 

I'm not a monster! I'm not an invalid. I'm still ME. 

Don't you GET it??? I'm sick, but I AM IN HERE, and I am fighting as hard as I can. I have been. Sometimes I win and sometimes I lose. And sometimes neither of those things look the way that you want them to. But I'm fighting.

One or two of you might know what it's like to question every moment of happiness, to fear every moment of sadness. One or two of you might know what it's like to do things, over and over because they feel good, not just good, but amazing. 

No one gets to feel good all the time you say, but what if there was a part of your brain that, in the absence of feeling that good, felt the exact opposite, at least 35% of the time. 

One or two of you may understand what it is like to question a relationship every day for YEARS, wondering whether this was it, whether you could ever handle something that made you feel more alive without literally going insane. 

One or two of you may understand what it is to have your affect blunted for most of TEN YEARS, your sexual desire coming out for MAYBE one week every three months, and wondering every day if it's the medication, the situation or YOU. Miserable, failing you. 

Or do you know what it is to be the best and the brightest, but not be able to hold onto a job, or a career? To be down to your last $200 and know you can renew your professional license, pay your student loans, make your car payment, or pay the electricity bill, but only one?

Because of the eating disorder relapse and my history with it I developed gastroparesis, I won't bother to explain it really but basically I live with pain and nausea every day and loss of appetite, which made recovering from my ED difficult.

I've made huge progress in that, I'm healthier than I have been in a long time and I actively take care of myself as best I can, but my bipolar has come to take a turn.  Over the years I've managed to find a meds combo (Trileptal and Gabapentin) that keeps my moods more level but I struggle with depression and anxiety (PTSD as well) and it frequently keeps me in the house.  Often times I'm scared to be in the presence of strangers or to do simple things like make phone calls, pay bills, etc.

This has limited me so much.  I have a boyfriend and he's very supportive and helpful, but he only does contract work and isn't sure he's going to be able to return to school for the tech career he chose.  I see him struggling and I think if he can't do it, what will I do?  I'm useless, I dreamed once of finishing school for myself but my bipolar has kept me failing classes or bailing out of school due to symptoms for so long that the dream seems ridiculous to me.  I have no job, no money, my parents no longer want to help me, I don't know how to apply for disability or if I'd even get it.

I see my friends getting engaged, buying houses, talking about having babies.  All I want in the world is a family of my own and a home for us to live in.  I used to take for granted that this would happen for me.  I feel empty.  I feel like I ruined my life.",['amod'],0,neu_vader

After an okay re-entry and adjustment back to working, I now find myself bordering on dysfunctional and heading in a bad direction RE: relationships with drugs (alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, adderall...).

I've always wanted to spend significant amounts of time traveling/living abroad and spent five years of my 20's (21-26) working in int'l affairs at a nonprofit that coordinated diplomatic/professional exchanges.

When I finally took my big trip this past December (Middle East &amp; South Asia), I had amazing experiences and felt better than I have in years.  I think part of it was the catharsis of finally doing what I had been dreaming about, and part of it was being far away from the stressors in my own environment.

On one hand, I sincerely loved living abroad (even just for a month) and everything that came with it--the freedom, the opportunity to lead a totally different life, the partial fulfillment of my international dreams...

On the other hand, I have so many things that I want to accomplish back here in the US and in my own home state.  I've got a good job, a great apartment, group of friends, and family close-by...

Part of me thinks I need to say fuck it and go full gonzo to fulfill my dreams of traveling and living a totally different lifestyle while I'm still young  (27 now).  Part of me thinks I need to just be patient, save up some money, and get some counseling and meds, but I worry that a medicated version of me might be willing to sacrifice that dream of international travel for some short term stability.

I had just been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and finally, I was able to recognize the long pattern of destruction in my life, beginning in junior high and continuing on today. With therapy and proper medication, I’ve been able to begin to put my life back on track, but it will take time. I wanted to express some of my struggles to reach out to anyone who may ever struggle with this disorder. When people say it is painful, that can’t begin to describe this emotional teeter totter, tipping uncontrollably and unpredictably.

As a child, the only word used to describe me was precocious. Sure, some people may have said that tongue and cheek, as I asked questions above my level of comprehension, but I was mostly happy and loved to play outside from sunrise to sunset, no matter the season. When I hit junior high, my personality rapidly began changing. The happy-go-lucky youthful playfulness was replaces with insecurity masked with an almost egotistical confidence. I began to cycle through friends and personalities at an alarming rate. In seventh grade, I tried to fit in with a peppy crowd, “dating” boys who I thought were in the junior high in crowd. I was over-developed for my age, and in eighth grade, I began to become hyper-sexualized. I dated every boy in one group of friends, and removed the quotes because dating no longer constituted simply kissing. Preppy T-shirts were replaced with band shirts and my long brown hair was replaced with shorter orange-red layered hair. Everything had changed. I had moved states, gone to a new school and completely reinvented my identity. It should have been a red flag, but because of the move, it wasn’t ever addressed. I can’t remember any change in behavior being addressed.

I soon shed my eighth grade rock friends and boys for the academic group of my new school. I again shed my wardrobe for cute T-shirts and jeans. This group liked to blend in, so I liked to blend in. I was focused, my grades increased dramatically, and going into freshman year, life was looking up. Until I met the senior crowd. Okay, so they were the senior band and theatre crowd, but for me, it was a bit overwhelming. I had quickly gone from the preppy academic friends in my grade to hanging out with the young men and women in the senior class. We skipped around in hot tubs, attended some parties (although I abstained from alcohol until my own senior year of high school), and fooled around. The senior young men liked the confidence I was exuding and the senior girls liked to be around senior boys. It was a great time for fourteen year old me, but entirely inappropriate. Luckily, I never stayed with one group of friends long. After graduation, I had to find a new group of friends.

After the seniors graduated, I began to fully dedicate myself to my remaining friends in band. I toned down my personality and began to focus in school. My grades had slipped during my freshman year, but I knew I could fix that. I worked my way in with the band kids of all grades and dated from freshmen to seniors. I was hyper focused, hyper sexualized, and changing to a new uniform again. After that phase, I began to hang with the kids from choir and theatre. Lasting a whole three years, this was my longest group of friends. I began to have a loud personality with volatile mood swings. I was accepted in this community, but I don’t think I would have been able to cope in this time with any of my other friends. My grades were volatile, and y behavior in class was a reflection of this. I was star of many shows, stage manager of those same shows, and over committing myself at work, in choir, and in my classes. It was frantic, but I balanced it all and brought my GPA up to graduate cum laude. Looking back, I see the ups and the downs, but as an extremely subjective observer, things were messy.

Today, as an adult in my early to mid-twenties, my patterns of depression and mixed episode hypomania are much more defined. My college years were plagued with 2.5 GPAs and 4.0s. Today, as a student in a PhD program, I am feeling wonderful with therapy and medication. I was free the day I was diagnosed because I could begin to move forward. I could create some order in the chaos. I could begin to recognize why I had pushed people away, overspent my credit cards, hurt myself and my husband, finished degrees so quickly, overcommitted, underachieved, fit no stereotype and all of them. It has been a bumpy road, but hang in there and seek the help you need. Sometimes life can become amazing.

TL;DR: Childhood was bumpy. Adulthood doesn't have to be.

I am currently 4 months pregnant with twins. Sounds exciting I'm sure. But it has not been. Yes, I am extremely happy to be having babies, and actually my husband and I have been trying for a while.
So what's the problem? I feel like I am going absolutely insane right now. I have been off meds for a while, while trying to get pregnant, but have been doing pretty well. Now that the hormones have kicked in it is a whole different story. I have been so depressed and paranoid, and of course horrible self image problems. Some days I can barely function. My husband has not really been feeling the brunt as I have been turning all the anger and sadness inside. Good for him I guess.
I just don't know what to do. I work more than full time, and have a 16 year old son. I do okay at work, lots of distractions. But by the time I get home I am a wreck. I have had a few mania trips, but primarily down. I am eating healthy, getting some exercise (prenatal yoga and walking). But nothing seems to help.
My husband is very nice, but seems insensitive to everything. As soon as I start getting down he closes up, he barely talks to me or looks at me. He makes jokes like at least I'm not mad at him. But he says he thinks, from what he has heard, this is all totally normal.
I am starting back to counseling, but they couldn't get me in for over a month. Fortunately the month is nearing it's end, just another week and a half. But sometimes I feel like I'm not going to survive this pregnancy. I feel horrible for not being more excited about the babies. And I don't want my depression to have a negative effect on them.

Although I am bipolar, I don't claim to be an expert on either, and I certainly do not claim to speak for everyone who is bipolar; indeed, I don't claim to speak for anyone other than myself. But I have heard so many things lately about being bipolar that piss me off to no end, so I thought I would write this.

Being bipolar is not synonymous with being a narcissistic asshole. I can see how some people might get this idea, for instance, when a friend or family member never shows for get-togethers or other important events. However, just so you know, we are aware that we are missing something important. It's probably eating us up inside the whole time, which makes it even harder to drag ourselves out of bed, much less out of the house. 

My family means everything to me, and sometimes I can't even bring myself to call them, or go see them. It isn't that I don't care, and it isn't that I care more about myself than them, it's that I am embarrassed that I am such a fuck-up, that I am worried they don't even want to hear from me. I am worried that they will ask me what I am up to, and basically all I am up to is applying for SSI benefits because I can't even work at this point. I love my family SO MUCH, and it hurts like hell that I make them look bad because we are related. 

I know a lot of people tend to think that the right diet, exercise and possibly medication will ""cure"" me. And trust me, it's hard not to think that way. That if I just get a normal job and stick to it and stop acting crazy that one day i will wake up and not be bipolar anymore. But that isn't how that works. The days or weeks when you don't see me or hear from me, and if you do I just say I am not feeling well? That's because I am trying to justify my own existence. I want so badly to be a productive, happy, normal human, and I am desperately trying to figure out how to be one, when all I really want to do is die.

I reacted badly to Abilify, but let's not make this a meds thread*

So I've been going through a depressive episode around December and in the end of December my gf went abroad for some study exchange. Well, unsurprisingly I was close to hitting rock bottom during the first two weeks, so my gf and everyone else suggested I should just go out and just be among other people...After a lot of struggle I decided to do so and after my first night at the club I suddenly slipped into a manic episode. 

I spent a whole month going to clubs and bars every other night, partying and going completely crazy on the dance floor (people were actually impressed which probably was another boost for my mania and they kept asking me if I had some coke for them even if I was sober the whole time).

I won't have to explain what the manic episode felt like. Y'all know. It actually does feel pretty close to being 24/7 on cocaine for a whole month or longer.


So there's that. Ok, 'just' a manic episode and it seems like I'm switching to a hypomanic state again.
However, this time it seems like I came out as a completely different person after that manic episode. 
Before my gf left I haven't been to a club since 5 years. I've been a loner, a complete introvert with no need to socialize. 
Winter, the dark, freezing temperatures and solitary places were my perfect holiday destination. 
I avoided crowds, cities and never cared about getting to know new people.

When I was that person I had the great idea of booking a trip to Iceland. To the fucking dark, lonesome and still fucking cold island in the Atlantic with blizzards and constantly overcast skies. Back then this seemed like an awesome and perfect trip.

Now I'm suddenly facing it from a whole new perspective. I'm no longer interested in dark, cold and lonesome wintery places, I need sunlight, warmth and cultural exchange. I'd now change the widths and woods of Scandinavia for places full of life, culture and outgoing crowds of people. New Orleans, Boston, Tokyo, Paris, Shanghai, and...ok...maybe Oslo...

If you had asked me 3 months ago if I want to take a free trip to New Orleans I would have told you to fuck off because I wouldn't have seen any benefits of going there.


Well all of that does pretty much sound like a positive change. However, I am a bit overwhelmed by this extreme contrast. Except for the time when I was hitting puberty I've always been a loner, feeling perfectly fine with no one around. I've been living a life that was perfectly adjusted for solitude, and even after my gf and me got together I was still living very solitary with no need to socialize with anyone else except for my gf.
And suddenly it seems like my life got a completely new, completely opposed direction. I really haven't been prepared for that. It's just so strange to deal with these new desires to socialze, meet people etc.
Also, I'm no longer interested in the Iceland trip I booked. I actually don't want to go there but everything is already paid so I probably will. And even if I have a cancellation insurance they probably wont pay for episode-induced changes of a bipolar disorder patient.

Have you experienced something similar? Like feeling like a completely different person when in a manic state?

I meet with my psych today and plan to mention this to him. Obviously I'm saying this sort of tongue-in-cheek, but it does run through my mind quite a bit as I try to navigate these muddy waters. If anyone can relate I'd love to hear from you.

I can no longer be a part of this relationship because he refuses to seek treatment and his symptoms (and choices) are very damaging to me.  I gave it 2.5 years but it's time to go now.

I am concerned that I am walking away before he got any help from anyone.  His symptoms qualify as bipolar disorder with psychotic features.  He has never received treatment.  He went as far as the evaluation.  He says, every day, that he will call... but never has ""a chance.""

He has auditory hallucinations (music) several times per week and auto-hallucinations (seeing self) a few times per year.  He reports being frequently disassociated.  He has more hypomanic than truly manic states but he lacks any ability to manage his independent living skills.  For example, he went years without brushing his teeth and has no concept of a budget.

He has one primary support system; his job.  He has worked there for 12 years because he gets away with being a quirky, cranky, smart guy.  He has been referred to HR multiple times for anger management, though, and has had half a dozen managers because he gets shifted around frequently.  I've heard him yell at his boss, his CEO, and colleagues.  I fear he will eventually lose this job.

He stopped seeing his friends, altogether, when I moved in with him a few years ago.  I begged him to go see them or invite them over and even held two parties with them in attendance.  However, he prefers to isolate.  He is a borderline hoarder with no house management skills. He doesn't clean, ever, and stacks walls up around him that I call his nest.  He isn't safe; doesn't leave trails to door, leaves open cords inside the couch, doesn't turn off stove, or lock doors, etc.

He is highly intelligent so he gets a pass from most casual observers as just being odd instead of mentally ill.  In fact, I knew him for 10 years before we moved in together and I had NO idea how sick he was until we shared a space 24-7.  He is definitely severely and persistently mentally ill and needs treatment and medication.  However, as far as I can tell, he has no intentions for self-harm and wouldn't meet criteria for any sort of involuntary hold.

Do I tell people?  I sent an email to his best male friend about 6 months ago mentioning that I was trying to encourage and support him in getting out more.  That's the extent of what I've shared with others.  He has never been a social butterfly and always kept to a very small circle of friends.  His family is supportive, I suppose, but his mother is very enabling ... aka he lived on her couch with most of these symptoms for years and she did nothing to motivate him for treatment.

He does have a family history of mental illness.  His father is an alcoholic and was likely bipolar (undiagnosed) and his mother likely struggled with depression (also undiagnosed).  They are of a different culture than myself and I have heard that plays into resistance to label something as mental illness.  There are no history of suicides in his family; that he can communicate to me.

Why am I leaving?  I can't take anymore.  My health has deteriorated completely and I'm at risk for stroke/heart attack (in my early 30's).  He is very manipulative and co-dependent.  He is very forgetful.  It is like living with a special needs child.  I don't say that lightly... I mean he has to be watched every second or he will build a fort in front of the door or leave the stove on or fall down the stairs because he threw his pants there.  

I have tried literally dozens of approaches to helping him at home and he has rejected everything.  There has been some progress. After two years, he now brushes his teeth at least 5-6 times a week (huge improvement) and has learned how to cook.  He is able to keep a routine for about a week (daily showers, bedtimes, work times, etc) but then, it falls apart.

There's just nothing in it for me except pain.  It is literally dangerous to be around him... several hundred times, when he's prepared food for us, he's included ingredients that I'm allergic to... and honestly, I don't know that it's not intentional at this point.  Either he's very disorganized, to the point of possible psychotic disorder, or he's intentionally keeping me sick so that he can better control whether I stay or go in the relationship.

Anyway, this is super long, I'm sorry...  I came here to ask... as people with this struggle.  Would you want someone to tell your friends and family or let it stay a secret?  I don't want to damage him by sharing his secret... but I don't want him to get worse because no one knows.  I wouldn't tell them in spite, not in the last, I would tell them only that I feel he is very sick and needs to continue in treatment with a psychiatrist.  I would not be doing this for revenge but truly out of love.  Despite all he's done to me (and trust me, there's a lot I'm not mentioning here out of respect), I love this man and want him to get better... I just can't be here to wait on it anymore.

Thank you, in advance, for your advice.

After finally seeking out treatment two years ago for my mental health problems, I've been able to stick with the same therapist/doctor for a year. My diagnosis has been bouncing around, and right now I have ADHD-PI, depression and social anxiety. However, my doc is also considering a bipolar diagnosis, since genetic testing shows that I'm susceptible to it (I have my own theory that there's something underlying several disorders that makes them seem so connected, but until mental health becomes a real medicine, I don't think we'll get answers on that any time soon).

Anywho, I was wonder what y'all's thoughts are on inspiration, or the feeling of inspiration rather. 

The reason I ask is because I used to be very creative, all into drawing, writing, music and anything else. Very spiritual as well. Six years ago, when some nasty trauma happened that triggered a huge breakdown, that creative part of me broke. I just haven't been able to get ""back"" into it. However, I keep getting these little pieces of inspiration. 

I'll be going about my life, and then BOOM! ""Hey, you feel that in your chest? Get out the MIDI controller, you're about to make music!"" I'll follow it, happy that the inspiration is back. Three days later, the ""inspiration"" is gone, I hate music, and then I hate myself for not being able to stick with it, and for playing so poorly for the time I *did* stick with it. 

As I began to recognize that pattern, I started suffocating the urges as they came, since they just caused a lot of horrible feelings for me. Really interrupted life and all. As my doc and I checked into ADHD, we began to see those episodes as maybe impulses, and the ""hyper focus"" shit. That's lead to a lot of questioning, like, what is inspiration? Where does inspiration end and impulse begin. And is this shit more about bipolar than ADHD? Or is it just part of being fucking human?

Bleh, this has gone on too long. Okay, **TL;DR** kinda. With bipolar, do you folks get that huge lift in your chest, that little creative muse that tells you to go forth and create? Do y'all tend to see it as more of a manic kinda thing, or is it just normal?

I'll probably bring this up to my doc today as well. It's been bugging me for months. When should I stuff the ""inspiration"" down, and when should I pursue it?

Thanks, and y'all have a good one. Sorry if I don't reply. I tend to avoid things when I get anxious about it. ",['attr'],0,neu_vader

I was suicidal last night, but my mom refused to take me to the hospital.  She said I just wanted ""attention,"" I was being dramatic, my boyfriend was going to leave me, I'm ruining her life, too, she wants to die, too... she just yelled at me for 2 hours until I finally managed to kick her out of the room.

I've never seriously contemplated suicide until recently, and it's really scaring me.  I'm glad I went to sleep when I did, or I don' know what would have happened.

I talked to my boyfriend about it and scared him for the second time over this.  I'm so worried he'll leave me.

What do I do? :(

-------

I'm incredibly depressed tonight.  Last night was my first night on 750mg of Depakote, marking the 8th? 9th? day I've been on it.  I thought it was working already because I had two good days.  I don't know anymore, though...

I spent the day being really productive.  I woke up at 5am and spent until 1pm cleaning my room.  I read half a book.  I listened to a ton of songs on spotify.  I texted lots of people.

Then I spent 2 hours painting.  I haven't painted in a year because it really started triggering me in bad ways and reminded me of all the stress I was in art school.  I used to paint for 24 hours straight, barely getting up, at points in my past.

So I had fun with it, but then I show my family and they said that they didn't understand it.  My brother said that I should try still lives to ""get back into the swing of art.""  I was just trying to screw around and not making anything serious.  I was just trying to be expressive and let my emotions out.  It was abstract.  Nope, they didn't like it.

I posted 4 old paintings on facebook and it only got 2 likes.  So I started what my boyfriend and therapist called my negative spiral.  I blew up.  I felt awful about myself.  I felt extremely unstable and that I'm a failure at art and therefore a failure at art.

I told my mom I'm depressed, and she did what she always does and started screaming at me to snap out of it and ""oh no don't start this again and ruin our night.""  It made my dad come out of his room and start screaming at me that I'm an a-hole and I ruin his life and make him crazy, and so I told him that I hated him and hope he goes to hell.  All the while I was screaming and hysterically crying.

What in the world is wrong with me?  Bipolar?  BPD? Depression?  I know you all can't diagnose me.  But...  My doctor thinks I'm rapid cycling bipolar, but I don't know.  I'm so confused and just want to feel better.  I want a medication combination that works and makes me feel better instead of me freaking out multiple times a week.

This happens all the time and I just feel so out of control and like I can't stop it.  Is there a name for my behavior?  What's wrong with me?  I don't see my psychiatrist for another 4 weeks, but I see my new therapist tomorrow for the second time :(

I've been diagnosed with several mental illnesses including anxiety disorders, depression, Asperger's (mild autism), and a dissociative disorder. I agree with my diagnoses, but there's some symptoms I experience regularly that can't be explained by my other illnesses.

Things like mood swings, irritability, and anger. There are very few times when I'm not severely stressed and angry at my family. It's almost impossible for me not to raise my voice at them when we talk. 

My mood seems to shift around a lot too. I experience times when I'm highly motivated, energetic, joyful, and productive. There are also many times when I feel the complete opposite. Lethargic, depressed, no motivation, little or no interest in doing anything, and poor hygiene. The change in my mood isn't due to anything obvious either. One day I can be feeling amazing and the next day it can be hard just to get out of bed.

I've never been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but my old psychiatrist tried prescribing me a mood stabilizer because of my mood swings. I also had some blood tests done a while back and I was told that I'm deficient in lithium. I researched lithium and I keep seeing articles saying that lithium deficiency is linked to bipolar disorder. 

Another thing I've noticed is that I'm highly sensitive to any stimulant. Whether it's a medication, herbal supplement, or even something as simple as low amounts of caffeine. If I take any stimulant, I start experiencing what appears to be manic symptoms and it's almost impossible to fall asleep at night.

I'm not asking for medical advice, but I would like to know if this sounds like bipolar disorder. I'm going to mention my concerns to my psychiatrist when I see him, but I'd like to know what you guys think.",['attr'],0,neu_vader

I'm drinking Powerade during class to keep myself hydrated.  My performance is definitely down... 

Is it realistic to think, while on Lithium, I'll ever get back to peak athletic performance? Am I going to have to drink a gatorade or something everytime I do high-intensity cardio?

Currently enrolled on an intensive college course at a fairly prestigious University in the U.K. I'm in my second year and things are going awfully.
I basically screwed up my academic year through illness, bad choices and drug addiction. I sat absolutely no exams throughout the year and my attendance was pitiful. I pleaded to the director of studies and a few professors and they allowed me to resit all my exams in August after the term had technically finished.

Therefore I've been trying to cram over 210 hours worth of lectures and revision into only a few weeks. My first exam is coming up.

I'm losing my mind: I'm hearing voices, having heart palpitations, hallucinations, mood swings. Fuck.
I feel like tearing my hair out. The worst thing is I deserve this and I specifically asked for it.
My eye won't stop twitching, I feel like my teeth are falling out and my sleeping pattern is completely reversed between day and night. 

To top it off during a manic episode I broke up with a girl I really loved and i feel awful. I  desperately want her back but she is currently 1000s of miles away in her home country for the summer. I doubt she'll take me back anyway.

Also I had to come clean to my parents for the first time about my diagnosis (Bipolar 1) and the medication I'm taking. They are so disappointed and horrified. 

Don't even know why I'm posting this here. I'm just in the house alone, hundreds of miles from my friends and family and I need to rant.

I'm off my drugs for now, though that should change come monday. That's probably the cause of all this, at any rate.

I usually do a really good job of bottling up and keeping the worst that this disorder has to offer away from the people around me, but this week has just been too much. There's a really significant chance that I'll be out of a job shortly, as the company I work for isn't doing all that great. Hints have been made.

Frankly, this scares the hell out of me. No money means I cant drive to town (I live on a rural property) to see my pdoc, who I can't pay, and be prescribed medication, which I really really need. The job turnover in this town is pretty pathetic, and it took me more than three months of searching to find the job I've got.

So I did what anyone would do, and slipped into a state of fear and anxiety. This leads to me blowing up at my parents, over something small and inconsequential that I can't even remember. I really flipped my shit, and I don't think I'll be too popular around here for a while.

This is all while I'm worried about a close friend who's been put in a difficult position after a car crash, as well as the little things like stressing about uni results.

It was really just the last straw. It's been a hell of a shitty week.

In the last month I've seen two psychiatrists (my old one, who proved to be a worthless asshole who wouldn't listen to me, and my new one, who actually listens to me and seems to want to help,) and one therapist (who also listens to me and wants to help.)

I'm going broke in copays and burning through my vacation-time at work. I have another P-doc appointment next week AND am starting weekly therapy, plus the drug copays incurred with a medication change (dropped depakote, titrating up onto lamictal, upped abilify, unchanged cymbalta.)

My diagnosis has changed from Bipolar II to Bipolar II with Borderline Traits, Avoidant Type. My therapist has diagnosed me as being in a depressive episode with severe anhedonia. That's the part I was hoping to avoid - the depressive state. When I saw my old P-doc, I had hoped he would listen to me about the changes in state I was having, but he didn't - he dismissed me completely because I've recently separated from my husband and told me it was 'all normal' - and it took me over two weeks to find another P-doc. It makes me wonder what good could have been done in those two weeks had I had a P-doc worth his salt.

Life's not fair, I guess. But now that I'm riding the elevator to Hell, nothing tastes good or feels good anymore. I'm hermiting from friends. Hobbies and pleasurable pastimes do nothing for me; even getting up the motivation to start doing something other than sit around or sleep is nigh-on impossible. Somehow I manage to keep getting up to come to work and am doing okay performance-wise, but that's because I'm forcing myself to use what little energy I have to ensure that I don't fuck it up.

I know I just have to ride this out, but damn, I'm so scared of going back down into the dark. I don't want to be suicidal again but the hopelessness has already settled in for the long haul. I can't even get up the strength to cry.

Second: not sure if I'm still hypomanic or starting to go mixed again...

On to the main topic:

For those of you who haven't read my heartwarming story about the night I met my SO, it was wonderful. He saw my meds, asked what they were for, I told him, he hugged me, said ""I'm sorry you have to deal with that, it must be hard...but that's just a part of you, and that's ok"", I cried, we've been inseparable every since, he's the most caring/understanding/supportive person I've ever met blablabla that's the gist of it.

We've now been together for about 2 years, but 7 months ago he lost his job. He works/worked private armed security.  The company refused to meet his request (as supervisor) to hire another officer to have on-call. He got sick, the one other officer couldn't cover his shift, so they fired him. He still gets some money from unemployment,  but it's just enough for him to get a month's worth of gas, pay his car insurance, and get some groceries. I pay rent, cable/internet, most of our food costs, every time we go out for drinks.... plus my meds, food/treats/vet visits for my dog, gas for my car and motorcycle (luckily that one's cheap), my doctor's bills and bills for all the blood work I have to do all the damn time... but we get by. Paycheck to paycheck,  but we get by.

Honestly, I don't mind that part so much. It's the depression that my SO has developed after being unable to find work for so long. He applies to jobs all the time. Not just to his field (where the standard pay seems to be dropping from $16/hr to $12/hr, and nothing is full time) but also several in computer maintenance and Web programing... 7 months, 3 interviews, 1 call back that never went anywhere. At the moment he's waiting to hear from one potentially great computer job while going through the application process for the local police department (passed the written and physical tests, personal history questionare is due soon, then the investigation portion and HOPEFULLY then he'd go to academy and be paid $15/hr... in October...then possibly get one of the four open spots)

But he's so depressed at home, especially when I'm not there. It's nearly impossible to get him to do anything. I constantly have to text him reminding him of chores/errands that he needs to do, which almost never get done. If I'm there he can wash dishes and go drop off mail and we can go get groceries no problem.... but if there's a sink full of dirty dishes, the most I can expect to come home to (even if he says he's done ""most of it"") is a few clean glasses, some pans soaking, and still a mostly full sink.

Now after months and months of saying ""please make sure you get this done today"" and it not being done... and finding out he played video games or took a nap most of the day... my patience is running low. He even messed his shoulder up the other day and rather than my normal caring self, being concerned about his shoulder and the fact that it needs to be 100% better before possibly getting into police academy,  I just keep wanting him to shut the fuck up, take some more ibuprofen,  and stop whining. His computer is running slow? Then do some damn chores.

Despite all this, when we're out or relaxing (after I've made sure everything for the day is actually done)... he's the man I love again. He makes intellectual conversation, he's affectionate, and he's confident...

It's so frustrating to see that he's indeed still that person and to see all that go away when he's left to his own devices. Without me there, he can't seem to do much more than stare at the wall or computer screen and think about ""what a failure he is"" and how ""nothing good ever happens to him""

He does such a good job taking care of me when I'm unstable, but he simply refuses to follow my advice on dealing with depression. He's said that it's just because I've dealt with it more that I'm ""strong enough"" to work through it, and all he needs is to find a job... but until then his depression is just becoming more and more of a weight on our relationship. I can't seem to convince him that he needs to work on it (which, if he felt better,  would probably make home more likely to be chosen for a job)

I'm giving some fairly serious though to joining the RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) and just want to know if anyone has any experience joining the military with a diagnosed mental illness?

I know that they can exclude you based on existing psychological conditions and medication, but is it a blanket exclusion or based on case-by-case assessment? I'm on Effexor and Lithium, but I feel relatively stable and I think that the rigour and structure of military life would only complement my stability, which I think my pDoc would attest to. A few friends currently serving in the military have told me I should just not mention it at enlistment, but I'd rather have them know and be able to prove that people with mental illness can serve constructively, and (hopefully) excel in the Armed Forces, which is something I think they are hoping to work on.

My dermatologist says isotretinoin is basically the only option left. 

There seems to be a lot of disagreement about its association with suicidality and depression. [This paper](http://emjreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/Isotretinoin-and-Psychiatric-Effects.pdf)(pdf) talks about several studies and concludes: 
&gt;there is an uncertainty about the association between isotretinoin and psychopathology.

Have you had any experience with this? Any knowledge you could share?






Edit There is one really damning study.

&gt;In 2010, a retrospective chart review[30] of 300 BD patients identified 10 patients treated with isotretinoin. Nine of the ten patients experienced an exacerbation of mood symptoms: six mixed symptoms, two depressive symptoms and one hypomanic symptom. Three of them developed suicidal ideation. Symptoms began from 4 to 20 wk after initiation of therapy and resolved with discontinuation in all but 1 patient. Besides, seven of the nine patients were taking maintenance psychiatric medications for BD at the time of the apparent reaction.

The quote is from this paper (behind paywall):

&gt;Ludot M, Mouchabac S, Ferreri F. Inter-relationships between isotretinoin treatment and psychiatric disorders: Depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, psychosis and suicide risks. World Journal of Psychiatry. 2015;5(2):222-227. doi:10.5498/wjp.v5.i2.222.

But the authors of that study note:

&gt;The validity of our findings cannot be definitively confirmed in the absence of a double-blind placebo controlled design. Patients with BD can experience spontaneous relapses of mood symptoms, and this phenomenon could have been mistaken for isotretinoin induced relapse in this study. It should be noted, however, that eight of the nine symptomatic patients experienced a prompt reversal of the relapsed mood symptoms when the isotretinoin was discontinued prematurely or after a full course.

That study is:

We've been married for a little over 5 years and now have an almost 3 year old son. I've made some mistakes in my past and have corrected those mistakes. About 3 months ago, she got started on lithium (she's also on lamictal and adderall and a few antipsychotics and antianxiety meds)... Since then it seems that slowly everything started changing. It was around this time that she started going to therapy as well. 

She still told me that she loved me very much and everything but she started talking about how she wanted to make changes in order to be a happier person overall... also mentioned that those changes may lead to divorce. Some point along the road I found a conversation she was having with a ""friend"" and she was being very emotionally intimate... more than she had been with me for a long time. I confronted her about this and ofcourse she didn't want to stop talking to the guy so I tried to talk her into cooling it with him a bit and attempting to be more emotionally intimate with me. At this point I started seeing a therapist and learned that I was somewhat manipulative and selfish... something that I have been working on and continue to work on (my therapist and I believe I've been doing very well).

She visited the state in which her family lives for a few weeks with my son. When she came back I asked her if she still wanted to be with me and she said she didn't know. She told me that she didn't love me romantically and that she hadn't for a long time (didn't know if she ever did). I had also heard that she had spent time with the guy that I previously mentioned and so I confronted her, she mentioned that she had spent quite some time with him. I also learned that there were several times when she visited the other state with her family that she had self medicated and done a few things that she shouldn't have (which she had been in rehab about a year before we met). I found out that this guy also had a drug problem.

In any case, a few weeks passed by and she had mentioned being willing to try marriage counseling. I set up an appointment with a marriage counselor and that same day she told me she was leaving. She's been in another state with her family and my son for about a month now. She had said she needed to get away in order to heal and everything. Although she didn't love me romantically before she left, I could tell she still cared for me. After this time that she's been gone, I don't feel like much has changed on her part... positive changes anyway. She's become more distant, I video chat with my son every day (or every other day, depending on when he falls asleep) and progressively she's gotten further and further away. A week or so ago she said that she thinks we need to stop talking as much... to keep it down to subjects about my son and finances. I'm trying very hard to repair my marriage while everything has been torn from me. I know some redditors may ask me to give up on my marriage but I believe marriage is something you fight for until the very end.

In any case, I'm just seeking advice. Before she left she was claiming that her head was clear now and that she was stable but the way things have been going, it seems to me that something is wrong and I think it may have to do with the lithium or something. 

All I know is that I want my family back and I miss her and I miss my son so very much. I'm not even sure from a legal standpoint if she can just up and take my son to another state. I only get to see him 3 days out of the month now because they're about a 6 or 7 hour drive away. His home is here and I have a stable life here with a good job and a house... whereas she is struggling to find a job in her family's state and is living with her family in a house with about 5 people.

So yesterday [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/3i8zgf/8777274747_suicide_hotline_hung_up_and_blocked_my/) post. I've never used a suicide hotline.

And on a selfish note, If I'm suicidal, I'll seek my therapist, psychiatrist, or ER, not a suicide hotline. 


Anyways...


**[7CupsOfTea](https://www.7cupsoftea.com/)**-- What is it?


I just used 7CupsOfTea, for the first time. Which was at least a much better experience than what was described with the suicide hotline. But 7CupsOfTea is not at all a suicide hotline; [it's simply a place to vent or chat, if you're feeling down](http://www.7cupsoftea.com/about/about.php). 


""We are a peer to peer emotional support system. Whenever someone is feeling depressed or lonely, they can get anonymous emotional support from trained active listeners on 7 Cups to feel better. They can use it whenever they want—it’s available on-demand, 24/7, worldwide.""


**My Experience using 7CupsOfTea**


Last night I woke up, heart racing. I wanted to talk, but it was far too late to call anyone. So, I decided to give 7CupsOfTea a shot. 


I went to the site's main page and clicked ""connect to a listener."" Do not do this. The first conversation was not the least bit helpful. I'll call the first person I talked to listener 1. Listener 1 didn't understand what I was saying. Listener 1 seemed childish. I quickly said, ""Thank you for your time. Bye!""


Then I went to ""Group Support Chat."" Again, a huge let down. Teenagers saying ""hi"" to each other on repeat.


**Browse**


I was about to give up on the site when I saw: [""Browse Listeners.""](https://www.7cupsoftea.com/BrowseListeners/) This. This is what you need to do if your are using the site. You may search by country, language, disorder/problem, key words, age, and availability.


I clicked the first, highest rated, listener that came up. Listener 2. 


Lister 2 was *amazing*. They were professional and empathetic. Later on in the conversation they said that they were there to help me reflect and ponder, not to give advice, which I appreciated. This is what the site promotes. They prompted me to think about basic self care and communication. Listener 2 provided basic reminders about important things like therapy and medication, without giving advice. 


Later, I compared listener 1's profile to listener 2's. 


Listener 1: 3/5 star rating out of 21 reviews
Listener 2: 5/5 star rating out of 4 reviews


I agreed with the ratings. Listener 1 was a 3/5, in my opinion. Listener 2 was a 5/5.


(It's silly, but I like that I can rate them. If someone ignores you/is a jerk, you have the small satisfaction of rating them 1/5. And, if a listener makes your day, you can give them an extra ""thank you"" by giving them 5/5 stars. It's a small way for listeners to be held accountable.) 


Listener 1: Languages- English, Gujarati, Hindi (which is cool, but it quickly became clear that English was not his first language.)
Listener 2: Languages- English


Listener 1: Choppy writing and grammar on his profile
Listener 2: Proper grammar on profiles


Listener 1: Categories- Breakups, LGBTQ, etc...
Listener 2: Anxiety, Depression, Managing Emotions, etc...


So, check out profiles. Find someone who looks like a good fit. Spend 5 minutes chatting, and if it's not a good fit, move on.


Side note: I'm a bit paranoid about privacy when using the internet. This site seems decent about protecting privacy (based on my limited use). You don't need an account, and they delete all but the last 10 messages that you send. They only keep those messages so you can remember who you've talked to, in case you want to message the same listener in the future. They use standard security technology. My listeners didn't ask me any even remotely personal questions. I talked in depth about my problems, general feelings/thoughts, without reviling my gender, age, location, etc... I've shared far more personal information here, on reddit.


I hope this helps you. I was skeptical about the site, and after talking to listener 1, I was extra skeptical. But after discovering the browse option, I've decided that it's a great resource. I'm going to use it again. You might find it very helpful. So often, people are here, on /r/bipolar, to talk, and don't get responses. You will get a response in minutes, if not seconds, on 7CupsOfTea. You can search for a listener who cares about the specific problem you're struggling with, who wants to listen. I hope you continue to post here, but if you want to talk right away, 7CupsOfTea is awesome. 


**tl;dr:** If you're having a slightly down day, and want to vent or chat, I recommend 7cupsoftea.com. Just be sure to use the [browse](https://www.7cupsoftea.com/BrowseListeners/) features. Don't be afraid to try a few different listeners. ",['conj'],0,neu_vader

I've been diagnosed/confirmed? by 4 separate mental health professionals as having bipolar 2, and I have told all of about 5 people in my life.  It isn't easy.  I hope that by sharing my story, perhaps others will be able to action in some way about their life.



Being bipolar has never been easy.  When I was 17, I went through a period of almost sleeplessness (2-3 hours, maybe) for about 6 weeks.  Nobody new what to do.  My mood wasn't wild and swingy yet.



When I went to college (this part is ages 18-21), my mood became incredibly wild.  Some days I would wake up and be king of the world.  Other days, I would want nothing to do with other people.  I used to be incredibly angry at friends and family for no reason.  One example, was when I was pissed at a friend for ordering red sauce on HIS pizza.  I was so furious that I had to leave.  



When I started to feel down (I didn't realize the highs were abnormal, nor would I want them to be abnormal) I realized that I needed help.  I was also in a horrible relationship.  The doctor I saw did not want to diagnose me as bipolar, but keep an eye on me as a possible candidate.  However, my GF refused, and absolutely retorted the possibility.  This lead to a HUGE downswing (never suicidal) where I wanted to be alone, hated the world, and really did not believe in myself.  I became immensely afraid of death.  Luckily, the episode only lasted a few weeks. Thankfully, shortly thereafter, my relationship ended and I moved on with my life.



I ended up in another relationship; one where fights were common.  It typically had to do with me being ""absent"" mentally from the relationship. During this relationship, I became immensely afraid of death.  In my car, as I turned corners, I would tighten up as a slip of my hands could cause my death.  I decided I needed help and was put on zoloft.  A few weeks later, I became even more down, and a nurse practitioner prescribed me prozac, but told me to titrate down the zoloft.  The combination of these two drugs sent me into an absolutely hypo-manic state.  I broke up with my girlfriend, slept for about 2 hours a day for six weeks, and almost always felt my mind was on fire (in the sense that I accomplished whatever I wanted).  This was the final straw, and my pysch diagnosed me with Bipolar 2 (along with confirmation from my weekly therapist).



Since my diagnosis it has been a wild ride.  I went through incredibly wild mood swings.  The worst part for me was that I would wake up and have NO idea how I would feel.  Especially since I often would not have a reason for how I felt.  However, with the help of a psychiatrist, therapist, and the want to become ""stable"" I have been able to begin a life that I enjoy.  A life that I want to continue to live.  A life that I know I am happy with.  What has helped me?



First off the drugs:  Lamictal 250mg.  Bupropion 150. Adderall 20mg (ADHD diagnosis recently confirmed). Lunesta 6mg when needed.



This regimen, along with weekly therapy, has helped me become incredibly stable.  For the first time in my life, I have had an extended period of happiness, stability, and excitement for my future.  I am more motivated than ever for my future.


It was hard work.  I had to accept what I am.  I had to find something inside myself that wanted to get ""better.""  In the end, it has absolutely been worth it.



Find a friend.  Find a doctor.  Find a pet.  My ride ( I am now about to be 24) has been wild.  From irrational mood swings, to 6 week periods of sleeplessness, my life had been crazy.  But I am now committed to living a happy stable life.  While the hypo-mania was an unbelievable high, the swings were not worth it.  Finding help is absolutely worth it.  Never believe that you can't be who you want to be.  Never give up hope.  For some people, the mania is so amazing, that medication and therapy may not be worth it.  I have been there.  I understand the feeling.  For me, treatment was worth it.  I have been incredibly stable and health for the longest period of my life.



Please, know that I support others with this condition.  I am just learning that it is ok to be me.  I want others to know that I support you.  Thank you for reading my story.  Feel free to ask me any questions.



TL;DR: I have bipolar 2.  My journey through life has been crazy, but through therapy and medication, I am the most stable and the most consistently happy that I have ever been.  I support you.",['conj'],0,neu_vader

I graduate from college next month in my hometown and also have a part time job that I like.

However, this isn't enough. I still feel depressed at the end of the day, or even at 1:15pm like it is right now. A longtime friend just bitched me out online because she says I haven't been there for her and she gives up, and it really hurt my feelings. To be fair, I haven't reached out to her in about a month, but she also hasn't reached out to me either. I didn't even respond because I don't want to respond out of emotion and I'm really upset. I know I can't please everyone but I try so so so hard and feel that because of my bipolar disorder I'll never be able to just feel satisfied even though I'm doing so many things right.

I honestly don't even know if it's worth responding to the friend for awhile. I just don't even think it's worth it. I hate being vulnerable just to get shit on. What's the point? I'd rather not say anything.

I guess why I'm posting here is because I truly believe I am a kind person at heart, but there are just some people in this world who like to shit on my parade.

Let's begin with my name. 

Although now I can see that I have been struggling with my Bipolar Disorder for as long as I can remember, I spent my childhood and most of my adolescence unaware that I was mental, convinced that I was just weird. I had never met anyone ""weird"" like me until late in my adolescence, when MySpace connected me with a girl who would later become one of my best friends, and we were inseparable. 

She nicknamed me Ambiso the Great, and I adopted it as the name for my bipolar alter ego, because that was the person I was with her. After a long journey of self discovery, including missing for days, hospitalization, compulsion, scratching, miscarrying, stripping, sex, drugs, meditation, and medication, I still struggle with Ambiso on a daily basis.

I want you to know that I have found my place in the world. I am no longer depressed, manic, irrational, self destructive, or suicidal.

It is pretty good right now, happy to say he is doing really well. 

Because of my experience (and I don't for a moment think my experience as a parent/caregiver compares to someone with Bipolar) I am very sensitive to those who throw around the term bipolar. As in ""it was cold yesterday, now it is hot today. The weather is so bipolar"", or ""half the time she's all perky then she gets all bitchy, she's so bipolar"".

Not trying to seek a diagnosis, genuinely confused and would appreciate your thoughts/experiences.

Long story short - I'm 24, Male. Self acknowledged introvert, with a propensity to be extroverted in the right crowd and setting. I was diagnosed officially with clinical depression in 2009. Personally, I know I've had it before and since. Maybe not to the same degree as the 2009 episode, but it's still a lingering demon. Went on meds. Came off meds (Lexapro and Effexor). Had weird withdrawal-like symptoms from the Effexor and swore off anti-depressants.

Have, for as long as I remember, been reasonably intelligent. Set high standards for myself, although never really jelled with reality and my lack of motivation at times.

I've graduated my tertiary studies and now work in a demanding and high-stress and highly competitive profession. 50+ hours per week, often more. 

I've always expected the world of myself with a plan about who I thought I should be, and how successful I felt I should become (bar is set pretty high). My parents aren't wealthy (middle-low class professions) but they've supported me and always encouraged me to be the best. Never pressured, so feel my expectations are self made in light of my underlying potential for intelligence. 

For as long as I can remember, I've always been depressed. However, it's always been in degrees. Not necessarily in response to any stimuli, but sometimes yes (breakups/deaths etc). 

BUT, I have had amazing times and look back on periods of my life where everything was going well and I felt alive. These periods see me doing my best work and I feel genuinely happy and alive. Again, sometimes in response to stimuli, sometimes not. 

My question for you folks is: how do you know it's mania? For me, the question is 'maybe this is just what it feels like to be normal...'. It's subjective, and I can never experience the world from another person's perspective, so I can't be sure. 

My suspicions were raised when my girlfriend mentioned that she thinks I act strange at times, over the top and weird. I've read definitions online of what it is to be manic, but I don't think they fit how I feel. I just feel 'normal', as in, 'not depressed'. But I have started businesses, let them go when I felt they might succeed (fear of failure?), made plans for my future and changed on a whim, made friends instantly and discarded instantly etc etc. But I feel that behaviour is normal, or have shrugged it off as a consequence of depression kicking in, not mania subsiding. 

Have never had any real delusions, other than self imposed expectations of success and my ability to achieve. 

Money isn't really an issue in terms of seeking therapy. I'm paid well and have reasonable health cover; it's more a matter if time (ie I don't have any away from work), so haven't seen a therapist since I was at university in about 2009/2010 (where it was free). 

Seriously confused about the distinction between my mood when I'm depressed and when I'm not. Can anyone shed some light on mania and what might be an indicator of mania? Personal indicators etc? 

Thanks for your time.

Recently, I called a suicide hotline and they set me up with a psych evaluation. I am being evicted, lost my job last week because I could not leave my apartment and have yet to recieve any meds. My Med evaluation is not for a month. I cannot wait that long. No clinical therapy for 2 weeks.

So I am suicidal, no meds for a month at least and homeless in three days. However, just being diagnosed has been a small flame of hope.

It could have been said in the heat of the moment, but I can't help feel it was based on something. She had a lifetime of dealing with her mother and her condition/medication and the ups and downs it brought (I don't remember what it actually was), and as little as she thought she knew me at times, she knew more than anyone else ever did. 
So it bothers me that she actually came out with this and that it was in the form of a genuine accusation.

I don't dwell on it every day, but the thought never goes away. I'm not sure why though... sometimes I feel unfairly misjudged, or hurt it was said as an accusation and by a person I loved. Then at times I hope she was right so I'd be able to explain my life without it being necessarily my fault things are the way they are.

Long story short, after the death of Robin Williams and everyone everywhere on the internet talking about depression and mental health issues, I couldn't help but bring back up the thought of this accusation again. So with a morbid sort of curiosity, I went to Google and found the NHS' section on Bipolar and the apparent symptoms.

I started reading the list, got to about bullet-point 5... and burst out laughing. It was genuinely amusing having my whole personality detailed in front of me like that. The only inconsistency I see is lacking appetite, if anything, mine has increased quite consistently over the last 10 years.

I worry that all of my former accomplishments were tied to extended periods of beneficial hypomania - and that it's all going to get medicated away. I don't know how I let things get so bad. 

I had planned on telling my advisor about what was going on with me. Before I could do so - he berated me and called me out on my inconsistent productivity - especially this late in my program. So I told him about my diagnosis - and pretty much shut down after that when the tears started flowing. He jumped the gun and I couldn't do it on my terms. There were so many things I had wanted to tell him. I'm embarrassed and traumatized. I was hoping for a hint of empathy. 

He wants weekly meetings and a timeline with milestones. For reasons that have nothing to do with me, my funding runs out at the end of the summer so my defense has a hard deadline. I don't think any of his expectations going forward are unreasonable, but I have no idea how to motivate myself and work through the hopelessness and anxiety. I don't know how to pick up the pieces. I have trouble accepting help from anyone; I am disgusted with myself. My work is so disorganized and flooded with pointless ""brilliant"" side projects. A failed long-term study crushed me with inappropriate guilt and flooded me with avoidance behaviors. I forgot how to be a scientist, which is the greatest loss of all.

I CAN force myself to write, but I get distracted with prioritizing as there is an unfinished final project. I haven't been in lab for weeks. Its completion is non-negotiable.

I don't know how I will be able to talk to him in the future. He was so detached. It's going to be so painfully awkward. How do you strike a balance between taking full responsibility for your behavior and knowing what is your illness? I think if I could accept the latter with some compassion I could move forward without the fog of guilt and shame clouding my judgement. 

I know I need to eliminate this stressor from my life if I'm ever going to achieve some sense of stability and reset. The end is there dangling in front of me, but my confidence has evaporated. This fact does NOT motivate me. It feels like I have already failed and I keep spiraling into soul-crushing despair. I don't see how I will get any satisfaction from finishing. I feel like a trapped animal - it's too late to run away. Quitting is not an option, but there is no progress.

For me the illness was sudden.  I was at an amusement park in a sea of people, and suddenly I couldn’t breathe. That was the first panic attack, and agoraphobia morphed from there.  

Over the years I have combated this issue with all that I could, using cognitive therapy and medication in tandem  to fight against the invisible force that would hold me hostage in my home.  And now, though I have conquered it, I still struggle to keep balance.  I must be so careful not to overload my schedule, commit to too many people, add new experiences suddenly, or just plain make poor use of my energies.  It’s always there in the background…waiting.

So when I have these times of living too close to the surface where everything is raw and ultra- sensitive, I automatically look to ascertain whether or not the bipolar is tied securely to its post, and I look to the anxiety disorder to make sure it hasn’t picked the lock on its cage.  Once I am certain it is neither of those taking over, I have to look at how I am living, who or what is impacting me.  As I write this, I am considering that I am coming off a great wave of drama that has been running its course in my life, simply by my association with others.  There is always that let down after such a ride…You wonder if the life you normally lead is enough after such an experience…Well, at least I do.  

But tonight as I am thinking of how easily and readily comments and losses and all those things I don’t have in my life that I want are weighing in, I am forced to consider who I am in spite of the illnesses and the things I don’t have and the drama I am over.  And I have to ask this question again…Am I enough?  Is who I am without all of that enough?  If I never step beyond today will what I did and who I was have been enough?  

Tonight the answer is ambiguous.  I just don’t know.  And even as I plunk out these words I am reminded of a verse…A verse I have prayed over and over as a mainstay… “I will never leave you or forsake you”.  I know only Abba could say such a thing, because we humans are a fickle lot, and we leave and forsake all the time, often without realizing it.  I certainly  have.  I would like to think that the grace Abba grants me is for me to see myself with as well.  Do you think that is possible?  It must be, because when I think of choices I have made and things I have said, I know grace is the only thing that keeps me here…Looking at myself…Learning about myself…Loving myself…Giving me a another change to be…ME.  

So I am going to bed…The raw places in my spirit are going to sleep too, and tomorrow I will awake the same old me I was today, but I think it will all look very different tomorrow.  Why?  Because when void of all else…I still have hope :)

http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1i14ey/30_years_oldnewly_diagnosednever_medicated/

Well the job failed miserably. I started taking 1mg of Klonopin (the generic Clonazepam) I was happy about sleeping better. That was why the psychiatrist said he was giving it to me. He didn't say he was attempting to treat mania and anxiety with it until I pressed him for more.

Despite the positives of reduced anxiety and absence of mania, I went for several days into a depressed rage (scary combination)

When I started my first day at the new job, it hit its peak. I knew within the first few hours that the job would bore me to death, make me feel claustrophobic and most importantly, place unrealistic expectations on me.

I quit the job immediately on the first day and resume taking the 1mg of Clonazepam last night. I slept a solid 6 hours without budging. Today I've woken up with no mania, anxiety, little to no depression and a surprising amount of energy. 

The moral of my story...is I thought it was the medicine to blame. The truth is...I am not able to work right now. Despite my resistance to doing so, I really think I am going to need to consider disability. I'm 30 years old, in a lot of debt, and I want to get married again and have a family this time.

I can't have a family without any income and if I can't work, I don't know what else to do. What's also frustrating is that I feel like I really am an intelligent person with a lot to offer, its just that being mentally ill is really hampering my progress in life.

I smoke pot constantly to numb my body. At least that feeling is something that I can control. Control is everything to me. I need it. Without it I go crazy.

Lied to my doctor that I could no longer see her just so I wouldn't have to pretend to have things to talk about with her. All because the things I wanted to discuss I refuse to bring to light. The memories from that period aren't much better than these I am experiencing now. Therapy and medicine failed me. I felt it poisoning my body and I am still too afraid to be truthful and open with another person about stuff that I cant even discuss in my own head. What do I do? Where do I go from here? Help… 

(Currently trapped in a mixed state; at least I think. I used to be able to trust my own intuition but I've been so mixed up emotionally for the past 3 years or so that nothing seems real anymore. I can't distinguish the real me from the depressed let alone recognize when happiness and euphoria are nothing more than another brief manic episode)

When I last saw my psychiatrist, a couple of months ago, he said that I couldn't be bipolar because sodium valproate didn't work even on the clinical dosage and that necessarily meant that I had borderline personality instead and referred me elsewhere to a psychologist. This makes no sense, this is like saying to a depressed person ""Hey, antidepressants don't work on you so I don't think that you really have depression..."". The black and white thing about mood swings being either bipolar or borderline also baffles me. Not being bipolar does not means borderline personality. I don't fit the borderline personality profile at all. 

Also, I had as usual, crazy intense mood swings when he gave me a SSRI (while being on valproate which didn't work) but he didn't see that as antidepressants hypomania induction. He only focused on the fact that vaproate didn't work. Anyone else had this kind of weird experience with psychiatrists? Do they really teach psychiatrists to diagnose disorders like that in meds schools or are psychiatrists just incompetent because nobody evaluate and verify their competence once they finish school?

My new psychologist highly suspects bipolar now and he is looking very deeply at my mood charts rather than skipping over them or assuming that I'm exaggerating like my psychiatrist did. Sometimes, I really doubt the competence of psychiatrists compared to let say psychologists.

I know that seems like a lot, but trust me, it is definitely accurate. What I am looking for is tools on how to support him when he isn't capable of listening to reason. I need to be able to show him that I love him and care for him, but without indicating that violence will be tolerated. We don't have the resources for residential treatment (at the moment, hopefully the school district will pull through) and he has been hospitalized six times in six months (the sixth time tonight).

In March my brother had a paranoid psychotic episode. We didn't expect it, but who does. He still has some paranoid tendencies, but doesn't seem to be in full blown psychosis of the schizophrenic nature. He was hearning voices, thought the mafia and everyone in our town was after him, and thought there was a device in his brain that would explode upon disclosing too much. His paranoid tendencies greatly subsided after two hospitalizations and the right anti-psychotic medication.
Tonight my parents set up a DVR for him. My mom blocked porn, but not regular TV (i.e. adult swim, CN). He saw that there were parental blockings on it and just lost it. He lunged at my mom, punching her and calling her a bitch and throwing drum sticks from our rockband set at her. My Dad came between them and was attacked by my brother also. He was punched in the face and and the ribs. Since he came home from the hospital he has been very attached to my mom and sometimes controlling of her. 

He has been hospitalized several times recently, but has a history of severe mental illness starting at age three. He comes from a loving home and hasn't suffered any abuse in his childhood. 

Our primary concern right now is his Bipolar disorder which is why I'm posting here unless otherwise directed. He was acting with extreme grandiosity. There is such a struggle to maintain order in the home and we are reasonably flexible. He will be 18 in 8 months and fear what will happen at that time. Hospitals don't do much but stabilize, but we can't allow violence in the home. If we allowed him to be in a situation where he could seriously hurt himself or others, we would never forgive ourselves. My Dad is at the end of his rope with this. My brother is now bigger than him and can easily overpower my dad. My brother has some slight developmental disabilities and lacks insight and self regulation skills to control his behavior, yet we don't know what options there are to benefit him at this time.

We are involved with our local NAMI group. He was signed up for a special therapeutic day school which he probably wont attend. My mother doesn't work in order to care for his needs and is in constant communication with his doctor. We have a family safety plan and are in family therapy.

I have no insurance, nor any chance of getting any as I am a nanny, and a young one at that (19) 

I excercize daily and I am trying very hard to get a solid sleep schedule, although it is incredibly difficult as I also have insomnia (Wheeee!) I am also in the beginning steps of modifying my diet in order to be more physically healthy (so as to hopefully bleed into the mental aspect)

Basically I would love any advice on how to not merely survive, but perhaps thrive un-medicated. I know there are many others who are in my situation and it would be very refreshing to see others in my rocky little boat.

I am so glad to have found this fourm and I am sorry if I have violated any reddiquette - this is my first post after a long time of imugr lurking!

Thank you!

So me and my boyfriend have been together a year. And I live him to death! 

But I am almost always in between moods. He knows I have bipolar. But almost everyday I wonder if I'm holding him back from true happieness??

U always think about dying. The what if factor.  And I see everyone who loves me sad for a week and moving on...my boyfriend would find someone knew no problem.

I know there is no cure. I will always get depressed for hours at a time. And I want to give him a reason to stay. But I can't find one. I am a huge mess who will most likely only suffer and bring him down with me. 

What do you girls think? Is this normal ? I have no idea how to fix this,

Warning: this is possibly a manically inspired rant and may read as such.

I have recently been tentatively diagnosed as bipolar. I had a previous phsychiatrist make a similar remark, but as I had never before considered it, and had not yet shed the cartoonish preconception of the drama masks, I took it as a passing remark without merit. Recently, after a somewhat severe bout of depression, I went back to my new psychiatrist with my concerns, was prescribed Zoloft, and have been on it for a month and a half.

About a week ago however I started to have incessant thoughts, of a philosophical inquiring nature. They began to form a story in my mind, a fantasy that I would later determine was the outline of a novel. I was however at the same time, gripped by an acute apathy. I was unable to do anything but lay in bed and scour wikipedia. School work, research, personal hygeine, all went out the window. For 72 hours hours I had these racing thoughts, where connections were made and the outline of a grand Magnum Opus was beginning to take form. 

I will return to the concept but the concern that my mental state was deteriorating was enough to overcome my apathy and to express my concerns to my psychiatrist. She expressed her opinion that bipolar disorder might be the issue and gave me a sample of ablify to add to the zoloft, and another meeting for this week. Following this meeting I devoured literature on bipolar disorder and the medications I was taking and the wikipedia explanations of manic phases rang true. I shed the stereotype of the happy euphoric drama mask and realized that my firey driven to-whatever-bitter-end obsession streaks were just that, manic phases. And I was in the depth of one, the worst I had felt. A novel trying to tear it's way out of me. Like I had some terrible illuminating insight that I had to share.

I want to say thank you /r/bipolar

After reading the memes and the stories and the little poems, I wept. I felt a connection that I didnt know I was lacking. A solidarity that I didnt even know could be felt. thank you.

My question is this: How much credence should I give my manically induced epiphany? How much of my life should I allow it to consume? Have any of you found reasonable methods for partitioning time between real life and this drive? 

My book's concept is of an uploaded human mind. First grappling with the sensations of a digital body, vastly different than it's former carbon one. Eventually the mind discovers the truth of it's state, the prison that fearful humans have bound it in, and the trivialness of the path to escape. The mind eventual controls the resources of the earth and dictates the fate of the universe, eventually battling entropy and the cosmological constants. All the while the mind battles with concepts like art, philosophy (of mind, consciousness etc), physics, computer science etc. And how these concepts will help inform the minds decisions. The mind knows the dangers of a human level artificial intelligence and wants to preserve the human race, but to answer these questions and predict this scenario it requires more resources. Introducing theme ONE: the addict. The answer is the solution and the solution is the problem. To help humanity the mind requires more resources to think, and more resources cause it to be less human. The cycle perpetuates, where the withdrawal (of non-humanity) is continually pushed back. The mind also contemplates consciousness, can a mind be duplicated? is that a pale shadow of the former? what rights or obligations are owed that mind? Can it save humanity by uploading all human minds? Can it duplicate itself? Here in lies theme TWO: The observer. The theme of consciousness is that of an identity (what i think it means to be me) and it's attention (what am I thinking about now? The homework I should be doing? if i am part of an elaborate simulation? the itch on my lower back?). The conclusion is that the observer can not observe itself. No matter how bright the flashlight or how dark the room, the flashlight cant illuminate itself. The mind can't contemplate and analyze it's own program. The program is too large to fit into it's working memory.

I keep coming back to this metaphor of facing mirrors. One philosophical concept of consciousness was the homunculus, a small person inside your head. Which begged the question, is there a person inside that persons head? Or the famous quote about what the flat earth rests on, Turtles, turtles all the way down. Well my character (and I) ponder the lowest turtle. What was before god the prime mover? what determined the cosmological constants? With two facing mirrors and enough visual aquity could one see to the very end it they could just get out of the way? The observer can not observe itself. theme two.

I return to the question. Have you found any ways to be both productive in your manic imperative missions and in school/work lives? I feel like this book threatens to consume me, like I have stared too long into the abyss. Is abstinence my best bet?

&amp;nbsp;

So yeah I've had a really rough life like a lot of people on this sub. Many traumatic experiences have been had (some that would be debilitating to the average person), psychotic breaks, the works. I've tried to kill myself twice, missed a major inoperable artery by just a centimeter with a razor once, and on and on.

&amp;nbsp;

There are aspects of my life that are still objectively shitty by most people's standards. I hardly (more like, don’t) keep in contact with old friends, I'm living in my mom's new apartment (which is now in the middle of nowhere) after graduating college, and the only person I consistently talk to is my ex-girlfriend from high school, but it’s not like we hang out, pretty sure it’s out of pity. I don't hang out with people outside of work or school. Ever. I can’t remember the last time I just hung out with friends from school or work. Even thinking about a romantic relationship or interaction of any kind is pure comedy at this point. I'm pretty much entirely alone, outside my family—but it’s hard to even talk to or get along with my family often. I’m guessing people usually go to dark places when they get this alone...

&amp;nbsp;

But despite my rough past, and imperfect present, life is actually pretty good. I made it through 4 years of neuroscience at a hard university and am on my way to becoming a doctor. By most available metrics, I should have not succeeded and done as much as I did—one of my major manic episodes was my junior year and still there is no reason for me to think I should give up yet. I work two jobs now, and am well liked at both, but I just don’t have it in me to try to form new friends. My condition is about as bad, if not worse, than most bipolar people, but I don’t let this get in the way of being high functioning.

&amp;nbsp;


But I’m lucky. My instability was bad enough I was involuntarily sent to a psychiatric hospital where I was *forced* to come to terms with how ill I was. And since then I’ve been incredibly careful to stick to my medication regimen and make it my top priority. I think because it was *so* bad, I have an advantage because I’m hypervigilant, and I need to stick to my demanding goals purely out of survival (without them, I’m nothing). No one wants to admit they’re as ill as they are, but I need to always be honest because of how demanding my life’s trajectory is. I don’t have time or the freedom to consider “but am I really ill?” or “maybe I could just see what it’s like without pills,” or “why is it always me?” I take pride in knowing not a single person outside of who I tell would even guess I’m bipolar, which is only possible by fully accepting how ill I actually am. It’s calming and inspiring to me to see how disparate my personal and public lives are.

&amp;nbsp;

And so, because there is such a huge void in my life, I am constantly filling it. I fill it with work and education and everything it takes to become a doctor. I fill it with my hobbies, constantly getting more adept and knowledgable. And I fill it with working out as much as possible—when I see the progress I make and how much more I’m lifting than the loud, tattoo-d, arrogant assholes next to me in the gym, I just want to share my optimism with the world… but then I realize there’s no one. But this just encourages me to push myself further.

&amp;nbsp;

So I’ve come to a point of my life where I can look back at my obstacles and accomplishments and can safely say I can handle anything that comes to me. And although a lot of the time only bad things come to me, I just have to thrive despite it, and I just fucking do it and that makes my life feel so worth living. It’s not easy, but just being positive and forcing myself to do what I set out to do is really all I need. I don’t normally have time to complain, and I don’t think people should ever give themselves time to complain.

 I will happily take care of my responsibilities as per my conscience without having any expectations from anyone.

2. Expectations From Self
 
 I am going to be happy at any cost doing the right things.

3. Accepting People and Situations as They Are/Come Without Any Questions 

 Remember in any situation, I am the creator of my own thoughts and feelings.

4. Live in the Present Moment

 No thoughts of past or future. Keep watching the mind/thoughts like I keep watch on a child with attention.

5. No Attachment. Only Love.

 Attachment = Love + Pain

 Love = Unconditional Acceptance

 If I am attached to a person and they are hurt, disturbed, or angry, I will also experience the same feelings and I will need help first.

 If I am NOT attached and unconditionally love that person, I am able to help and control the situation with a calm state of mind.

With all the gloominess around here, I thought I would share what I use to deal with my diagnoses. You are the only one that can help yourself. Therapy and medication only go so far in helping you; Sometimes you have to give yourself a hand.

I currently have a very close friendship with one girl, one guy, and a FWB with another.  My close friends understand that I have an extreme difficulty being anything but calculative and stoic, that's the way that I have always been externally.  However, it's finally internal!  My therapist said I should ask other people inflicted with BPI and see what they have to say about it, I know for a fact that it is my medication, but is it too much?  The reason that I brought up my FWB is this: she said that she is getting attached to me and feels that I am doing the same with her.  Wat?  Not really, what we have is very simple and discrete without much personal intrusion or emotional complication.  I told her that I didn't understand what she meant, and I don't want to hurt her if she wants more than what I do.  I don't quite get it...I haven't felt attached to anything and I'm not sure how I go about doing it.  A while ago, I used to have three best friends, but the other killed himself.  I went to the funeral and everything, even before I was medicated, but I don't remember feeling sad about it at any point.

Well during group I start seeing shadows, Drake is there. He's behind me. He popped up because some chick was talking about rape and molestation. Those are trigger words under the right circumstance. He tries to talk so most of group I am sitting covering my ears. Didn't help someone took my corner seat where I could see everyone and the whole room. So instead had to sit with back towards the door. My leader notices something is up and tells me to text her but I can't uncover my ears. She realizes soon what it is and stops group and just prays. Then gets everyone out and it's just us.

I am good. Then service starts and I start crying because I feel retarded then this guy walks by a few times. He's one of them, he's going to kill me. They all flood me again and I hyperventilate hands over ears.... Leader gets me out and gets my protection song on my phone so my ears are covered again with on ear with my phone. I am sitting knees to my chest. She is just standing over me praying, bending down to talk when I was able to focus on real people. Was quiet when I was really focusing on my song but never left me.

After three times of my song we go back in and sit. I asked about the guy and told her the voices said bad things.  She assured me he was a good guy. Service was good til then when Mr. Good Guy suddenly vanished. I started talking back to the voices and seeing things. Leader got me my song and I listened to until we left, she brought me home.

She never freaked out, never drew attention to me, called me crazy, or anything. She made comments on how well I am progressing and how committed I am to getting better. She was never annoyed or mad, but did suggest headphones so I can listen to my song anywhere. My whole family is mad and not wanting to understand and mad at and then here is this lady who has only known me for ten weeks helping me through a very public episode and all kinds of understanding and encouraging. Even keeps up with what my therapist says to do ( how she knew about my protection song and to get my phone) and my shrink making med changes.

I started getting a tremour &amp; restless leg syndrome when I went up to 150mg though. Doctor immediately dropped me down to 100mg, and wants me to titrate off of it to try something else. She said she doesn't want my tremor to become permanent.

Problem is, I LOVED Seroquel! I didn't have any of the ""bad"" side effects most people get, like the drowsiness or the hunger, and the tremor really didn't bother me that much. I came into this understanding that there will always be some side effects, and that there isn't really a ""perfect"" bipolar medication available yet. That doesn't bother me.

I have two questions:

1) How do I know when to tell my doctor about a side effect? I don't want to jump from med to med forever, trying to find a nonexistant ""perfect"" one... I just want to find something where the side affects don't bother me too much, and I can function as well as possible.

2) My doctor keeps telling me to try Lurasidone. It's quite expensive, which is why I tried Seroquel first, but she insists that it would be the best thing for me to try at this point. I couldn't find too many personal accounts online. Have any of you been on it?",['attr'],0,neu_vader

Here's a little bit about me: I'm 20 (almost 21) and for work I'm a Music Producer and Mix Engineer. I also have Bipolar Disorder, High-Functioning Aspergers, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Anti-Social Personality Disorder tendencies.

This is the story of how I witnessed my Mum attempt suicide twice, myself beating alcoholism, and both my Mum and I being in the same Psychiatric Ward at the same time. The best thing about this story? We're both alive today. And we're the best we've ever been.

It all started when I was 15. I was in my final year of School, but unfortunately, there was something not quite right about me. I was constantly tired; I didn't want to leave my house for anything; and I didn't want to speak to anyone. I pretty much became a recluse who went from being a B-Grade student, to not turning into school anymore. And on the rare occasion that I did go into school, I was a nightmare. I'd argue with Teachers just because I didn't want to be there. I didn't see the point because all I did was fall asleep in all my lessons, which resulted in me being kicked out of all but 3 of my Subjects. After a couple of weeks of this, I went to see my Doctor. He made a referral to the Child Physician to see what he thought about it.

After a few more weeks of me going on like I did, I got in to see the Physician, and he sent me to a Neurological Hospital for various tests due to him suspecting that I had Narcolepsy. When the results came back, there was nothing irregular and nothing to point in the direction of Narcolepsy. The Physician then referred me to CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services).

It was there that I saw a Professor who, after seeing me a couple of times, came to the conclusion that I had Paediatric Bipolar Disorder. He then started to Medicate me and saw me every month.

After a while, the Bipolar was under control, and I was back to my usual self. It's what happened after that, that I really wasn't ready for. I woke up in the April of 2010 to my Mum coming into my room to wake me up. She didn't look well at all, and as if she'd be crying. I asked her what was wrong. She went on to tell me that she was Sexually Assaulted on the previous night. I didn't know what to say. Seeing my Mum like she was, was absolutely devastating. For a while after it happened she was very on edge, and the littlest noise made her jump. After this, she found the best way to deal with it would be with alcohol. She didn't know what else to do. She wasn't getting anywhere near the amount of help that she needed. This led to her drinking 6 days a week, and coming home crying after pretty much every time she went out. During this period I witnessed my Mum cutting herself; she went missing a couple of time in the night; and she'd tell me that she can't cope with it. Unfortunately, in the August of that same year, she tried to kill herself while I was asleep, one night. I found her when I woke up in the morning. Including the leftovers from her overdose, and the note she left.

Luckily, her best friend at that time was a Nurse who only lived two doors down from our House. I called her friend, and we got her straight up to the hospital. Mum was still breathing, but couldn't say anything. As soon as we got to the hospital they took her straight into ICU. I wasn't allowed in there with her, at this point. After waiting for about an hour and a half, the Doctor came to see me and my Mum's friend. The Doctor told us that if she survives what happened, then it was almost guaranteed that she would be severely Brain damaged. Later on that day, my Mum came round. And miraculously, she wasn't Brain damaged at all. All she did was apologise profusely to me. I told her it was okay and that I understood. I did understand. Mental Health Problems can make a person do something that they wouldn't usually do. It changes people completely, but it's not that person's fault. They have no control over it, and most importantly; they don't want to be feeling the way they do, either.

After this, my Mum got professional help from the Adult Mental Health Department, and more importantly, she got the help that she needed.

About 2 years after all this happened, things started getting rather worse again. In the build-up to my 18th, I was drinking heavily. From my 18th onwards, I was doing what a typical 18 year old does: I was out every weekend getting so drunk I threw up everywhere. Unfortunately, this led to me not only drinking on the weekend, but also slowly started drinking more and more throughout the week, too. This obviously led to me becoming more and more unwell again, mentally. My medication was all changed around by my Psychiatrist, and he told me so often to cut down on the drinking. At that time I obviously knew best, and ignored what he had to say. Along with what my Community Mental Health Nurse had to say, as well. The drinking progressively started getting worse. My whole family was concerned about me, but I didn't see what I was doing wrong at that time. Little did I know that the reason I was drinking so much was to try and get rid of the flashbacks I was having due to everything I saw over the previous years.

When my drinking was at it's worst, I'd be having a bottle of Whisky a day, at least. This led to my medication being hiked up in dosage on a regular basis. This, along with the amount that I was drinking, resulted in about 10 stone of weight gain and enough medication to knock out a Horse. When I wasn't sleeping, I was eating or drinking.

In the New Year of 2013 I was admitted into an acute Psychiatric Ward. I'd hit rock bottom and I didn't see any way out. They managed to safely get my off the alcohol, and started sorting my medication out. I was in there for a month until I was then transferred to a Rehabilitation centre, which I stayed at for another 2 months. When I was in there, I was made aware of how bad my weight was. I was 22 stone. This, for me, was horrifying in itself. I'm a former World Champion Martial Artist, who was about 68kg when I was fighting, which was only 2 years prior to this. I was told that I needed to shift the weight, otherwise I'd have about 6 months left before I had Diabetes.

During my time in Rehab, I was pulled into a room for a meeting with my Mental Health Nurse. I was then told that the previous night my Mum had attempted to commit suicide again, but she was still alive. I went over to the hospital to see her immediately. It was then that I learned what was going on at home with Mum, whilst I was in Rehab. She split up with her boyfriend, was undergoing a lot of stress at work due to short staff, and she was up visiting me every night. Her Psychiatrist prescribed her Valium the day before she attempted suicide, and it was that which triggered her Depression and let to this happening again.

A couple of days after the attempt, she was admitted into the same ward that I was in. In the history of the hospital, we were the only Parent and Son to be on the same Psychiatric Ward, at the same time. When I saw her in there, I was relieved. I was relieved because I knew she was safe in there. More importantly, I knew they were going to get her sorted. Unlike me, my Mum spent 6 months in there, and I must say, she's never been better.

I relapsed a few months after coming out of Rehab, but I've now been sober for just over a year, now. Along with my Mum. Neither of us drink anymore, we're the healthiest we've been and we're the closest we've ever been. Along with that, since I stopped drinking and my medication was sorted out properly, I managed to lose 8 stone. 

Some people, including my Mum, ask me this question: Why aren't you mad at her for what happened? This is why: My Mum brought me up on her own, and always managed to keep a roof over our heads, and both of us fed and warm. She made sure I knew I was loved, and that was more important to her than anything. Mental Illness can severely distort how a person acts and behaves, and until that person is properly treated, they won't be themselves. This is what happened with my Mum. I knew it wasn't really her doing all of that. I knew that when she got the help that she needed, she'd be back to her usual self. And I was right.

There's a bit that I haven't touched on, but all the key events are there.

The reason for me sharing my story with you guys is to help. I want people to know that things do get better. Times won't always be hard, and the bad times will pass. Even if it seems like it's going on forever, it will end and things will get better.

This is 100% a true story, and if anybody has any questions about anything that I've said, then I'd be more than happy to answer your questions.

Much love.",['nsubjpass'],0,neu_vader

My dreams have always been cyclic (as with many things in my life) and I described periods of vivid dreaming and periods of no dreaming. Additionally, my vivid dreams periods would be dominated by either hyper realistic desires-come-true dreams, or they fantastical adventures of nonsense and wonder. Usually these periods would go on for a week or so before they changed, and my most common state was no dreaming. This fits exactly with my mood cycles. **mind blown**

I'm gonna pay attention to my dream patterns from now on and see if I can use it as a tip off for what mood I'm in. I'd say, though, that on medication my dreams are toned down compared to what they used to be like. One time I had a dream that I was adopted and my real dad was my favorite professor. He was cool, but it was crazy to go through. When I woke up that experience lingered as if it had been reality. It took days for me to recover from it, and every couple months during my depression it crops back up in my mind. 

When I was taking trazodone for insomnia I always had dreams that everyone was ""out to get me."" I also didn't sleep well on it, so that didn't become a regular medication.

Incidentally, several songs I've composed have to do with dreaming including one of my favorites to date.",['attr'],0,neu_vader

My life was always chaotic but I was able to fight through everything and the Dr. told me I was able to hide the symptoms due to my intelligence. 

I was able to complete an A.A.S., a B.B.A, and an M.B.A all with a focus in Accounting. I went from starting a career as a financial analyst with a major corporation and being engaged living in a beautiful apartment to being on the streets and living in my car by choice for 8 weeks as a way to toughen myself up. I ended up getting caught stealing and fought 4 police officers (mania made me a beast I was immune to pepper spray and a tazer) leading to 5 months of incarceration and a year and a half of probation (no felony luckily). 

Following jail and court ordered medication (lithium) I have gotten control of my life enough to move forward again. I have enrolled in a DBA program and start at the same time I get off of probation. During probation I worked as a plumber and speculated in stocks to squeeze together some cash to be semi self dependent again. Unfortunately I had to move out of state back into my parents house again. But I've been together with a wonderful logical understanding woman (a litigation attorney) for a year now and we will be moving in together shortly after probation finishes up. 

Our lives are full of extreme highs and lows, but I want everyone to remember two things:

1.) If it doesn't kill you, you become stronger.
2.) Keep moving forward: whether you are experiencing heaven or hell. Keep moving forward. Never quit.

I love you my bipolar brothers and sisters. Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle. We have more hardships than most due to our condition. On the flip side just remember from that you have the potential to be stronger than most.

My mom had severe psychological problems and I ran away from home when I was 12 after years of abuse. I never saw her again, as she died of a drug overdose when I was 19. I was young but her behavior was simply and at best described as maniacal. 

When I was 15 or so, it really started kicking in. I was always depressed, and dipped into suicidal thoughts frequently. I used to carry razors in my wallet to school and self harm in the bathroom stalls during lunch. I remember spending the entire summer break from school in my room in the dark, watching TV and reading. I barely ate or slept. I didn't talk to anyone. 

The mania spells the last few years have gone from not eating and sitting in a dark room crying to fainting, vomiting, crying uncontrollably, lashing out at everyone around me, hating everything and having morbid thoughts. Recently, I found out that my boyfriend was kissed by some drunk girl at a concert. We were arguing over the whole thing and I was being unfairly angry at him about it and at one point, I had a pair of scissors pressed into my neck and was threatening to kill myself in front of my boyfriend. I cut my neck and bled a bit, and the look on my boyfriend's face after he fought the scissors out of my hands and we fell over in the process. I'll never forget that. 

I'm starting to hate myself and feel hopeless. This is something that I've realized isn't just sporadic melancholy and it's something out of my control. If this is something that can be treated in anyway, I need to do something as soon as possible. 

I'm generally skeptical of being medicated for psychological issues (from observing my mom on everything from lithium to prozac). If you're on any kind of medication for bipolarism, what is it and how has it affected you.. negatively or positively? Is there any kind of alternative treatments besides therapy and medication?

I'm feeling extremely stressed and anxious the last few days. It's been a very difficult month with school and money and all that good stuff. I ran out of one of my meds a few weeks ago and have been feeling fine until recently. I'm having trouble finding a doctor as I've just moved in the last couple months. Even if I could find one, I don't have the money for the appointment or meds. I also have had trouble getting a good answer from a doctor about which type of bipolar I am so I'm really confused I can sometimes tell when my moods change, sometimes it's like a drop of a pin, sometimes it's gradual. I sometimes feel like I'm having a battle in my head as my brain will tell me that people don't like me, I'm awful, blah blah, but I know it's not true. 

It's just a really weird feeling and I guess I could just use some encouraging words. I don't know a lot of people and I don't know anyone well enough to talk about this with. Sorry for the wall o' text and maybe the disorganization.",['conj'],0,neu_vader

Before finding the right meds, I was so anxious and depressed I -never- left my home. I was a prisoner to my anxiety for almost 3 years. I stopped living. Learning to live again with my new meds, I started to enjoy life, I can now travel, move around, I have friends, a job, a place, a boyfriend ... But now what ?

For 4 months now I have been feeling ... nothing. The only time when my life seems to be interesting is when I get a slight surge of hypomania. Other than that, I feel numb. Dull. Like this time, I have nothing else to look for. Like I'm sad that I'm cured. But not sad. Just bleeeeeh. I don't want to kill myself. I'm in no danger. I just hate my numbness. And I'm so tired all the time. I have no joy. I have no sadness. I only have this weird dull state of nothing. 

My meds : depakine 500, abilify 5mg, paroxetine 20 

Anyone feels like this ? Any clue ? Any hope ?

And this morning, while I was still calm, before I had coffee or my morning meds, I realized I had not showered in 4 days. I managed to remedy that this morning before taking my kids to the store and BUYING ALL THE THINGS. I don't usually buy expensive things. Today I bought $150 of random crap because it was fun. We got 6 bags off little stuff. On the plus side, my youngest told me I am a great mom today. (Yeah, right)

But I feel like I am on the brink of doing something stupid. I have permission to raise my dose of seroquel to 200mg, but I don't know if I should. We (kids and husband and I) are going somewhere in the morning and I don't want to be too sleepy to be the mom. Plus, so far it has been mostly harmless (just expensive) fun.

There is that little tiny warning light blinking in the back of my brain. I feel great though. Logical me says this can't be good. But then there is that feeling that everything is awesome and I am totally in control (red flag!). Why can't I just enjoy feeling great for a while? 

I think I will enjoy this a bit longer, but give my husband permission to force me to take seroquel if he thinks I need it. That's rational, right?

I have been on and off medication since then and while not exactly stable, I haven't gone off the deep end completely in the times I was unmedicated, thankfully. 

Since I got married, I haven't been on medication because I am adamantly opposed to therapy. It just doesn't work for me. I went from when I was three until I was nine and again from when I was twelve until I was seventeen (while I was in foster care both times) and it has *never* helped me. I desperately wish it did but it just hasn't. 

When I originally made my first appointment with the new insurance, I was told that I was not going to be allowed to see a psychiatrist if I didn't go to therapy. I'm stubborn and I refused all services. Bye bye medication. 

Fast forward eight months - almost to the day - and I'm drowning. I'm desperate for help at this point but because I don't feel seriously inclined to eat my gun (sorry for that imagery), I don't feel that I necessitate emergency mental health care. But I can't wait the month+ for an appointment - partially because I'll be moving out of state (big stressor) in a month, for the year that my husband is overseas (even BIGGER stressor), where I'll be unfortunately-but-necessary close to my bipolar birth-mother who is currently pregnant and has lung cancer (HUGE RED FLAG STRESSOR!!!!).

I just seriously don't know what to do. I haven't slept in 31 hours and I'm exhausted. Mentally, emotionally, and physically. But I just *cant fucking sleep*. I am on the brink of tears because I am so tired of fighting to stay as level as I can while unmedicated. 

I *know* I need help but I hate this. Part of my issue is that once I start any kind of serious treatment for my disorder, I am then accepting that my one-and-only true love career choice is completely and totally off limits and I don't feel like life is worth living if I can't pursue that. 

I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I want to get help but I can't do that without accepting that I will never be able to follow my dream and that makes me feel like life isn't worth living. That is the only thing I want in life and it's just become something that was an option, *and then this happens* and I'm terrified. 

I'm terrified that I'm going to lose my will to live, I'm terrified for my husband to see me completely hopeless like that, I'm terrified once I break this time, I won't be able to put the pieces back together. I'm terrified of accepting this huge part of me that is just like my mother (ironic because she never stays on her damn meds and I'm currently off-meds, making me more like her than if I would just man up about this, huh?).

For the past few months I've noticed a depressive episode creeping in, just without the usual sadness and despair. I've been (mostly) functional, aside from the two weeks I went without my Concerta. My doctor even added Abilify for a month and I thought it might be working at first, but no luck there. 

Nothing really matters to me, everything is boring. Usual depressive symptoms. I don't even care so much about smoking weed lately, which is incredibly unusual for me. Whereas before the Concerta actually gave me some energy and focus to get through the day, now I'm in a spot where everything is a chore. I had a med management appointment yesterday morning and ended up blowing that off and then proceeded to blow off work too (bless my wonderful boss for understanding).

I have things that stabilize me. I say out loud (only while alone) that I want to kill people. It is generic and I don't actually want to kill anyone, but it stops my mind from wandering and I am focusing on what I need to do at the time. 

I say out loud that I want a beer even when I am drinking a beer. This helps me come back to reality and focus. 

Sometimes I say out loud that, (I just forgot what I was thinking). Heavy metal helps me calm down. Sometimes I want to just explode on people, but then I am ashamed that I don't want them to think I am crazy. 

My girlfriend talked me off my meds because she thinks that it affected my sex drive. I was just on an anti-depressant for ""anxiety"", but it helped me sort shit in my head (I think). 

I remember what I was thinking now: I sometimes say out loud that I want to go home. I guess I rationalize that as killing myself. I wouldn't do that because I am too scared about failing or maybe succeeding. 

I don't know if my pills helped me get straight in everyone else's mind. I do know that the doctor I tried after I moved refused to prescribe them to me. I don't remember what they were. 

I say that I am tired when I can't say other things (like when people are around) and it helps stabilize me. 

I am listening to damage plan's ""Save Me"" right now. It is helping me sort out my head. '

I can't talk about anything deeper without crawling into the closet and thinking that someone is going to come get me and lock me away in a mental institution.

**Act One: The Beginning**

Around the middle of 2012 I started getting rather depressed, my whole life was building up around me and I felt myself falling down into a black pit. My then-partner noticed this and convinced me to see my GP, which I did and she referred me to my local CMHT (Community Mental Health Team). I visited the CMHT roughly every two weeks and saw a very nice nurse and doctor there who always seemed to care and broke things down for me. After about 2 months of this, they told me they suspected Bi Polar disorder and started me on Lamotragine, gradually bringing up the dose which did seem to have a small effect. Eventually I started to feel myself again, was able to catch up with work and get on with life.


**Act Two: The Monster Returns (with new teeth)**

Fast forward to the start of 2013, I was starting to feel my energy levels drop, outlook on life dip and my general ""me-ness"" dissipate. Although this time didn't feel as bad as the last, there was one particular symptom which made it 10x worse, I had voices in my head and was even beginning to see things/animals/people that weren't there. It's as if the border between what was real and what was imagination had disappeared. I was literally terrified. I phoned my doctor and went to the appointment he subsequently set up. I discussed what was happening around me and how it was affecting me. While I was incredibly scared, I had still clung on to my ability to reason (i.e. if the people I'm with don't react to a fox on the table opposite, it probably wasn't there). In that, my doctor wasn't terribly worried about it, and sent me away and to told to call back if things got worse. This continued on into the start of February.

January wasn't all bad however, me and my then-partner had just moved into a new flat in Brighton, East Sussex (from West Sussex).



**Act Three: Goodbye Reason, Hello Hospital**

It would have been around the start of February in which I started to feel myself losing my ability to simply ""reason"" away everything around me. Around the same people around me started commenting on withdrawn I seemed and my then-partner was getting worried as I had stopped working, looking after myself or even leaving the bed, as well as some of the things I was saying and how I was reacting around the flat. While my partner was out, something must have snapped: All logic and reason had gone, my mine had consumed itself. I'm still not sure exactly what happened, however the gist is that daemonic shadows had appeared around the flat and were terrorising me, to the point where I tried to take my own life with 32 paracetamol tablets thinking it would be quick. My partner came home, found me in a mess and upon discovery of what I had done, phoned an ambulance. I was treated in a general hospital for the overdose and placed under a section and taken to the mental hospital up the road. 

While in the hospital ""me"" essentially came back to reason what I was seeing, after a few days stay. I was started on Quetiapine (anti-psychotic) and they also continued my Lamotragine. The doctors in the hospital threw practically everything in the ICD at me: Bi Polar Disorder, Schizophrenia, Borderline Personality Disorder and many more. After 2 weeks in hospital, one under section, one in-formally, I was released home.



**Act Four: East Sussex**

After being messed about on dates, my hospital followup appointment was exactly a week after release and I attended, the nurse there suggested it be first-episode psychosis and they are reluctant to put a label on anything or begin any proper treatment. They referred me to the Early Intervention Service the following week. Again I went, and I was in for a shock. Not only was I completely condescended too, they failed to get even the basic facts of my medical history right. I explained everything that had happened and was happening, and it was completely trivialised. Eventually they just said I was stressed and my case was going to be closed. They halted all treatment, medications, contacts. Everything.



**Act Five: The Present**

So here I am now, every day going by where I feel a little bit more of myself disappear. Sitting in a flat where every electronic device is covered in tin-foil to prevent government monitoring (I remember doing it, I remember why, if I remove it I will just re-do it later, but it just wasn't me).

I feel I have nowhere to turn, I was recommended to the charity MIND who while shocked at my treatment, only recommended putting in a formal complaint. I don't want to complain, I just want to protect myself while I still have the ability too, and I don't know how much longer that will be for.


Sorry I don't really know what I intend to do by writing this post, I'm hoping this excellent community might have some suggested or just want to know that I'm not the only one rejected help.


**Tl;dr: Moved city, new health system completely ignored: psychosis, suicide attempt as a result of psychosis, hospitalisation, previous diagnosis's and symptoms getting worse. Case closed, no help, no idea where to turn and what to do. Constant state of fear.**",['conj'],0,neu_vader

On Monday I was trying to explain to my step dad (who I loathe but treat in a neutral manner) how I was feeling on lamictal and how it made me irritable and angry.

They then yelled at me saying I'm out of control and I'm a maniac. I defended myself by yelling back explaining that I'm healthy. They called the police and I was detained and taken to the hospital, reason being that I came off my meds without a professional's opinion. But my mom is who told me to stop taking lamictal. The police asked if this was true because if it was I wouldn't be detained. She lied although I have evidence over text. 9 hours later I was released from the hospital for demonstrating healthy and functional behavior. As soon as I get home I was berated and called insane, just like when I got out of the hospital the last time (for actual suicidal ideation). I was grounded for going to the hospital last time for blowing things out of proportion and being unreasonable. I asked them if I could live with a family member and I was yelled at and told that no one on earth deserves to deal with my bullshit.

I have a family who offered housing but my parents will sue them and call the police if I live anywhere that's not with them. What do I do?

A friend of mine is a self-medicating bipolar who (Im fairly sure) has been diagnosed with bipolar as well. I got her into World of Warcraft and talk to her on there relatively often. Several times now we have gotten into arguments, later in the evening when she's 'medicating' usually, about things that have escalated very quickly due to her misunderstanding something I said, being quick to anger, and me sometimes being a bit too blunt for my own good (I guess...)

The most recent explosion started with her asking about a roommate and me directing her to friend him. She didn't friend him in-game but did so on Facebook; since all of us were playing and he was quite preoccupied, her demanding to know why he hadn't added her 15 minutes later struck me as a little absurd. Teasing her about this lead to a full-on verbal blow-out that ended with her claiming she was going to come to my house and beat my ass, and me telling her to hurry up because I was headed to bed. I haven't been on since then (for other reasons), but I did happen to see that she messaged me angrily on FB.

I have tried numerous times to get her to seek out professional help but I know how hard it is to a. find it and b. actually want it, so I can't really be angry with her for that (mostly.) I AM only human, and at one point when I realized she was NOT going to stop making a mountain of every issue she's had with me and people she associates with me out of a stupid friending molehill, I did somewhat antagonize her. Im not much of one to take things lying down, especially when I am being berated for what was an absurd detail. I have had several arguments with her in a similar fashion but I think this was the first where she claimed she was going to 'have to go to jail'. (For my part, I just told roommates and friends what was going on and not to answer the door if anyone happened to show up then went to bed. I knew her threats would most likely not be carried out so was unconcerned.)

I want to know your stories of how you've interacted with other bipolars outside of a clinical setting, and if one being medicated and the other not (you could be either) affected your interactions and relationship. For our part, we have made up in the past one way or the other (or she's not remembered all of it) but I've yet to talk to her after this recent explosion. I have precious few friends now as it is, and even though I know her IRL (we live about a mile apart) the distance of the game does give me a sort of comfort barrier. I'm not seeking advice per se, but I would like to hear how other people handle our 'siblings' with this same volatile illness.

I presented to a psychiatrist because my primary fears were around the insomnia especially as this drove me to a manic episode in the past.

This went on for days. I tried to get ahold of the doctor three times. I was blown off the first two times and the third time they prescribed me something. Didn't tell me what it was. I never actually got to talk to the doctor. My pharmacist didn't know what the drugs were for either. We had to Google and guess so the pharmacist could figure out why I was prescribed that. It's Cogentin. A Parkinson's medication, and it's addictive.

I'm not impressed with this doctor. Is it so much to ask that she actually talk to me for five minuts during an emergency? Or that someone at her office actually call me back? These pills terrify me now and I'm not taking them. I want to find a new doctor. I don't trust this psychiatrist anymore. She upped my mood stabilizers when the antidepressants were either making me manic or fueling it, then when the mood stabilizer fucked me up she prescribed me more shit. Shouldn't she have taken me off the antidepressant first? Shouldn't she have tried another drug that wouldn't make me so ill when this went wrong? Shouldn't she have talked to me for five minutes? Shouldn't someone have returned my fucking phone calls?

I'm doing my best to stay stable until I can find another doctor. I have an evaluation at the Cleveland Clinic in a couple weeks and I'm guessing I will have to wait a couple more months after that. in the meantime I gave my boyfriend a book on bipolar so he knows what to expect. He wants to be supportive but keeps doing the wrong things. I know he doesnt mean it but hes making things worse. Like keeping me up all night because he missed me and he wants to cuddle and mess around. Or when I try to explain to him what's going on he tells me everyone has those problems. I know he's trying to make me feel better but it's pissing me off. He already started reading the book so im hopeful.

Before last week I didn't know what it was because it's very new. It's called BELSOMRA, or Suvorexant. It belongs to a class of drugs known as sedative-hypnotic. 

Night 1 I took a half dose so, 10 mg of Belsomra along with my other night time meds: 400 Seroquel, 300 trazodone, 900 mg lithium, 600 mg carbamazepine. 

While I don't rely much on my fitbit to measure my sleep patterns. I knew that it would be a good comparison to some of the recent nights I did measure while wearing my fitbit. Basically it showed how often I was restless and awake, which means I wasn't getting enough restorative sleep. 
I had to make sure I had 8hrs to sleep at least before taking belsomra, and I needed to take it about 30 min before bed. I did that and made sure to measure my sleep patterns. When I woke up, the best thing was it that I felt great and rested! Most of all it was 6 am and I only hit my snooze alarm once before being able to get out of bed and not end up back in bed a few min later! That's often a big problem is waking up and getting out of bed. I checked my sleep pattern and I was asleep practically the whole time. I only woke up once in the night briefly, other than that I was out. So while I only got 7 hr 52 min, not the whole 8, I felt great!


**NIGHT 2**   I got 8 h 4 min according to fitbit, but after I woke up this morning and it was my sleep in day, I went back to bed and got 2 more hours. Once more, the sleep pattern shows I was not constantly awake or restless. I believe and it feels like I got more restorative sleep.

After one week I will go up to 20mg which is the actual dose. If I have further success I can wean myself down on my trazodone. my psychiatrist was thinking of weaning me off the seroquel as well, but the seroquel is actually helping me with my mania and keeping me from having pressured speech and racing thoughts. Not too long ago I tried to lower the seroquel, and then I saw that it wasn't just helping me sleep, it was actually helping with my mania.

I was feeling awful that night, and your kind words and understanding made everything a little better. I feel silly for posting again such a short time later, but I'm at the end of my rope. I need someone else’s opinion as to how fucked up this situation is, and advice on what I can possibly do to make it…well, less fucked up.


For starters, I had an affair a few months ago, during what turned out to be a manic state (I was undiagnosed at the time). It was like I was leading two lives—one with my emotionally distant boyfriend of four years, and one with this person who gave me attention and praise, and sort of fueled my mania. I completely regret it, though at the time he found out I was mostly just irritated. Like I said--mania.


We (the boyfriend and I) almost didn’t make it out of that. I decided to see a therapist so that I could address my own issues. He was deeply hurt, and I was deeply ashamed after slowly realizing what I had done, but we shakily trudged on. Understandably, I had to cut off contact with the other man, and have faithfully and completely done that. In addition, I had to cut all ties with the community of people that I had been close to for the past four years, and a source of income. My friendbase dropped to roughly 2, and those are strained.


He sends me mixed signals—sometimes he seems completely normal and happy; sometimes he feels sad and lays down in the bed with the bedroom door shut. If I don’t go in there to wallow in misery with him (which is awful for me, but I do it anyway), he gives me the cold shoulder for the rest of the day. When I do go in there, he doesn’t seem to want me around. I’ve explained that I can’t read his mind, but we consistently have this problem. 


He has decided that the only way that he will ever feel better *ever* is if he gets to have sex with someone else. That’s fine; I never had a problem with that idea even before I had my fling. But, he has fixated on one of my friends in particular. She had shown a mild interest before, but I’m not sure if it’s still there. 


He wants me to invite her over every weekend so that he can try and get into her pants. It drains me completely; I like to be alone and quiet on the weekends. He spent his entire weeklong holiday vacation on making her an intricate gift. He didn’t give me anything at all. I’ll be the first to say that I’m jealous. But, it’s like he has completely forgotten that I am a human being. 


Sometimes things seem like they’re going well, and then he’ll ask if I invited “M” over and I feel like the bottom is dropping out of my stomach. I ask him persistently if he will consider couples counseling, and he always says no. 


To top this off, he thinks that I’m faking bipolar disorder to try and get out of the consequences of my affair. Yes; I am definitely faking the suicidal, obsessive, overspending, indulgent, numb tendencies that I’ve dealt with all of my life. 


I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist, who agree that I am textbook type I, and I’m on the road to finding a medication cocktail that works for me. I am honest-to-god *trying* to be a better person and to make this right.


Is this fucked up, or is it just me? I don’t know what to do, but I know that I can’t keep living like this. I want for him to feel better, I just don’t know if I have the emotional capacity to help.

Nights where I have to go to bed early are often difficult ones. I could probably put my head to the pillow and nod off but I'm fighting that so I can write this. A rambling on about life and the direction we take it. I'm still in denial.

 This summer makes the 7th time I've gone in patient. Seven times is a lot. I wish I was inpatient right now not having to worry about work or social life just taken away from normal reality. I like the idea of that twin size bed and being awoken for breakfast. I miss the people in the psychward. I always find someone to talk to sometimes we'd form groups/ pward cliques. Said click would wander the halls all day and we'd look forward to meal time and snack time. If we're lucky we'd look forward to meds time because that's often our source of relief. At night we generally pick a movie to watch and sit there content in the community room watching a flick and around that time in the pm we get our happy pills and see how long we can stay up. Well once the community room is closed 
(ten o'clock ish?) we head out to bed. Meds always made me want to sleep before the movie was over. 

And then to bed I go. 

I'm not afraid of the pward I actually feel comfortable in it. In as long as the staff doesn't abuse us. When I was a child the staff hurt all of us kids very badly and abuse was rampant but I haven't seen anything such since 1997.

Sometimes I wish I could take a vacation to a psych hospital. I suppose the reasoning for that is to have a healthy structure. 7 times is enough times to forgo any conclusions of normalcy. That is to say that 7 times I've been hospitalized for bipolar. Most the times they were one week stays. Oh god have I seen some crazy shit within the walls of the hospital, that sweet safe space. I've seen attempted suicides, code after code after code being called when a patient loses their shit and tries to escape. Pff... Escape , I wish I could chill in the pward tonight. It feels like summer camp sometimes I find a comfort in all of the order there. I can have a little shower brush my teeth get ready for bed and sleep until breakfast time. It's really not so bad.

Let me take that back, I would take a Hollywood shower that is what's good in life. Can you say institutionalized. 
Do I need it? nah. Probably not. I crave the schedule though I'd like to create my own schedule. I don't want to cook my own breakfast and I don't want to do dishes. Being inpatient for a week with no chores can be so gratifying. What, I get to go to crafts and draw and paint!? Where else would I get the chance.

I struggled hard this summer with bipolar. My girl breaking up with me was a huge trigger. The smoking gun if you will. After 5 years and wanting to marry her she ditched me. I went manic. For the simple fact that if my life was all spread out on a table she'd gone and flipped that table over and thrown a chair. Yes I have trigger behind a lot of my feelings but I was susceptible to mood swings to begin with.
 Mood swings.

The mood swing. I'm still in denial about it I mean everyone gets mood swing but well some people feel it coming on harder than others. 

I work. On the highway as a toll collector. Easiest job I've ever had. I was once a US Navy Sailor. I got kicked out honorably because I was bipolar.  Come to think of it my entire 20's were a waste, first with the navy and then with 5 years of girlfriend. 

Wasted all these years. What did I learn? I learned myself. Me. I. What I have come to learn is that everyone needs some rest and relaxation. We need sleep we need a bed. Tell me the last time you slept in a bed not your own. It's different.
I'm going to go to bed.I love the pward I enjoy being different, it's my life by the way.kill myself never.Just give me some sleep aid and mood stabilizer.

I will try to replicate pward life with norm life.I gotta get up early tomorrow. i feel calm.",['compound'],0,neu_vader

I made it a goal, to maintain this over the course of my junior year. I had qualms with one friend, but I felt generally good about it.

The first couple weeks were okay, but then they started to show negative signs. 

My friends' conversation consisted of either bashing others or bashing each other. In one circumstance of people, I was always attacked upon anything I said. This continued, and I felt more and more invisible. 

At this point, the friend who I had qualms with is nearly foreign to me, she doesn't respond to anything I say- she simply begins a new story about herself. I yelled at her to be nice to people today and stormed off. 

My other friend (I only had 2 close friends sophomore year) and I had a sort of relationship, we had something close to sex just last month, but she was weird about talking about it. Last night, she told me she was going on a date with this girl who I was ""dead to"" for a year until last week when she forgave me (although she might have asked for MY forgiveness, but that was probably just speech). Anyways... at this point I just want to block out everyone. I want to get a job, volunteer, ANYTHING to stay away from people. 

I can feel it coming back. It always does around now. 

Tonight, my mom said a rude remark about me at dinner about how I think I'm ""soo independent"" but can't get myself up in the morning. I can't get up because a side effect of one of my meds (seroquel) is heavy sleep for 12 hours upon taking- making it very hard for me to wake up. The meds side effects are a sensitive topic for me, as there are a lot and they have changed who I am over the course of taking them. In response to my mom, I threw a couple corns at her, causing her to yell at me to go to my room, basically. Just before dinner I vented to her in tears for a while, which ended in her saying ""at least it's not cancer"", as my sister's friend's mom was diagnosed with it yesterday.

Anyways, after going to my room I cried a while, then tried to cut (the knife was dull enough to not work). I tried some coping skills, and I feel a bit better, but I sunk down pretty low for a bit.

I feel like this shows that as hard as I'm trying (I'm trying REALLY hard.), being sane isn't a possibility.

And I think that is the worst part of this all.

How many more shootings? How many more homeless and drug addicts do we need on the street before enough is enough. I can't stand it.

At the dinner table at Thanksgiving it's perfectly fine to talk about someone's struggles with cancer or diabetes, but the minute someone brings up their mental illness it gets awkward and weird because they shouldn't talk about it.

What other serious condition illness (besides HIV/AIDS) do you have to keep quiet about?  What other illness is the person who has is to blame. None.  And I say that's fucked up.  I'm not to blame.

We're invisible in the media.  The only TV show I've seen with a main character being treated for mental illness is Homeland and that's not even on regular cable.

The only time we make the media is when one of us doesn't get the help they need and kills themselves or a lot of people or both.  But at that point, they are dehumanized to the point where only a monster exists, not longer a human being who thinks and feels too.  A person, who with maybe the right combination of therapy and meds might not be dead or in jail and who might still be remembered as a person (i.e. most recently Adam Lanza and James Holmes).  

You might be thinking the American healthcare system is to blame, well yes it is in many ways, but before anything happens, the dialogue has to change.  How do you think marijuana was legalized in 2 states--the dialogue changed.

So let's start talking.  I'm bipolar, it sucks, but I'm fucking proud.

I don't even know how this all started, I just remember, in short, feeling like shit in the beginning of June, not knowing why, the ""episode"" lasting all month and then waking up today feeling like I awoke from a cloud of misery. This isn't the only time though. 
I am a highly functioning 24 year old female, I've been with the same boyfriend for 6 years (great relationship) and I have a great job that I love.  I've been on and off ADHD medication since 2008, currently on 50mg vyvanse and a small dose of adderall as needed. This realization of possibly having mild BP came to me because for the past month  my coworker ( who had been diagnosed as a child as having bp) has had to coax me through several depressive episodes over the past 10 months... I started the job in September. I am usually a very happy, positive person. I am enthusiastic about life, my relationships, and other things for about  3-4 months. Then, out of nowhere, I lack all ambition or motivation for 2 weeks to 1 month. I spent countless hours trying to understand why I'm depressed- is it my relationship? Why can't I commit to things? I'm not passionate about anything I don't have any goals I have no motivation I don't have friends what is WRONG!? Everything becomes gray and im apathetic about everything, not interested in learning things, getting really down on myself. I would rather sleep all day on the weekends then doing anything productive. The worst part for me is that I usually spend this time thinking about my great relationship, which for some reason, I think things must be going wrong. Then I get so over analytical about everything that it drives me NUTS. Although my SO is fantastic and supportive, I know it must get hard for him trying to understand what happens every few months and why I just spent a few months being totally excited for our future, and the next month not knowing or being anxious/ nervous. 

Then one day after about a month of feeling like that, I just wake up feeling  great. It's like everything just dissipates and I'm on top of the world again. My motivation to be a better person is back, I don't have to force myself to do activities I love like yoga and kirtan. I'm a better girlfriend because I'm not trying to find something wrong with our relationship. These are the times I get my grandiose ideas and when I start saving up for things, planning life, feeling more confident... Etc. 
I noticed that this was a ""cycle"" today, when my coworker pointed out her own pointless depression and bipolar symptoms. I realized that I had been feeling weird since the beginning of June, when the three months prior I had felt GREAT. Then I thought back to before the three months prior, and those were times I felt really shitty. I know there's a pattern. Could I be experiencing mild bipolar disorder or is this just my add? Could it be my add medication exacerbating symptoms? Why do I get so pointlessly depressed and such anxiety when everything in my life is good or things haven't changed? 

Tldr: noticing ""cycles"" of my happiness and sadness. 3 months happy 1 month depressed. 
Happy symptoms: totally positive, upbeat, motivated, in love, ambitious, want to learn more, plan well, make friends, make plans. randomly buy groupons for $90 Pilates classes and only go to one  class (example). Spending habits aren't terrible, but I do notice I will randomly decide that it's okay for me to spend $200 on whatever when I really shouldn't be. When I feel happy, I never think about me being ""sad"" again, but I might feel guilty that I thought all those anxious things before. Now that I'm researching this though, I'm getting really scared that my happy phases are going to be ridden with anxiety that another bad time is coming. This is depressing because I'm generally a very happy and enthusiastic person and I'm scared of that happening to me. I guess it's a test for my mind. 

Depressed symptoms: hit me out of absolutely nowhere, but I do notice that it might be around my PMS. Lasts for about a month. Anxiety about relationship, no motivation, get down on myself, stop planning for the future, don't have much interest in seeing friends, get kind of needy and helpless (like ignore eating meals until boyfriend makes them for us) don't enjoy usual activities like yoga or kirtan and have to force myself to do them and then get irritated when they weren't fulfilling, waste countless hours trying to figure out why I'm not ""happy"" when nothing in my life has changed. I wouldn't say that I'm irritable or angry during this time, maybe a bit more but not towards people I normally associate with on a daily basis, other than my bf. 

Also, I don't WANT to have this. I'm just trying to figure out if this may be an underlying cause of this cycle I'm noticing. I would like to be able to deal with depressive episodes by saying ""I'm just down right now"" instead of just wasting so much time wondering WHY I'm down. ",['attr'],0,neu_vader

To give a little bit of background, I am a 22 year old male.  Since I can remember, I've always had mood swings from extremely optimistic/outgoing to slightly depressed.  The depression has never been severe enough where I wanted to hurt myself or kill myself; it's more like I become disinterested in everything and just want to stay at home and listen to music/watch movies.  When this happens, I can't get motivated to do anything.  I spend a lot of time by myself.  This doesn't usually last longer than a few days.  Also, sometimes I get irrationally irritated about things.  People eating too loud, certain noises, laughter, general silliness, etc.  I really try to think about it and I have no idea why I get so angry.  I've really worked hard over the past few years to work on that and I've gotten a lot better.  I've learned to remove myself from those situations when I feel it coming on.  I have a wonderful girlfriend who I've been open with about it.  She's really helped me with it a lot, though I know it bothers her and sometimes affects our relationship and I really wish I could change that about myself.

And then sometimes, I have these ""highs"".  I get so much done.  I have great ideas.  I learn everything I can and have so many aspirations.  Some of these actually stick (I've learned a decent amount of Spanish, how to alter my own clothes, basic computer programming, and several other useful things), but a lot don't. I'm generally an outgoing, nice person, but when I feel this certain way, it's like I know all the perfect things to say.  I lose my insecurities and don't feel as shy.  Women love me and I know how to make them want it (though I've never acted on it when I had a girlfriend).  

To give more perspective, I think my personality naturally falls on the optimistic side.  I am a fairly outgoing, intelligent, and likable person.  I'm in decent shape and exercise regularly.  I have a great girlfriend and plenty of friends.  I love my family and have great relationships with them.  My family isn't rich, but we aren't poor (in that sweet spot where we have some nice things we want and still appreciate them :) ).  I have achieved a fair amount in life so far, but it's always been of my own choosing.  My parents don't put any pressure on me, because I've always been self motivated.  I honestly know how lucky/blessed I am to have this life.  Things aren't perfect, but I cannot express how much I recognize that my life is great.  I don't want to sound ungrateful, but sometimes, I just don't give a fuck about any of it.  I don't hate it or think it's unfair; I just don't care about anything.  I just want to stay home and watch movies or listen to music.  Sometimes I feel like I know where I'm going, and sometimes I feel like I have no clue what I'm doing with my life.  I think about running away sometimes.  I've always assumed these are just normal mood swings.  I feel like my moods could be describe as sometimes 125% of myself and sometimes 75% of myself.  Hopefully that makes sense.  Regardless, I've been able to live a normal life so far.  These down times don't last long enough to significantly affect my life and the highs don't cause too much risk taking (and I've been lucky).  I graduated high school and college with 4.0's (I have a good memory lol).  I'm now in grad school and doing okay.  I have a great internship lined up for the summer.  I've never made any major mistakes when feeling depressed or high.

I had never really even thought about bipolar disorder that much until I recently found out that my uncle (not blood related to me) is bipolar.  He will be completely happy and then get irritated for no real reason.  I can sort of relate to him.  Anyway, because of him, I started looking into it and here I am.

So, are these kind of feelings normal?  Even if I were to be diagnosed with some type of bipolar disorder, would it be worth it to get on some sort of medication?  How has it affected you guys?  The apathetic part sucks, but it doesn't account for a major part of my life and I like the way my life has gone so far, so I'd be scared to change anything.  Also, I love the feeling I get when I'm doing especially well.  And my baseline mood is still good.  So I kind of feel like I wouldn't want to let my parents or anyone around me know about it.  My girlfriend and I have talked about it and I don't think it bothers her.  She's basically reasoned that the good times (which are the majority) are worth the bad.  Once again, I'm extremely lucky.  Also, I'm generally against taking medication if I can help it.  I think it's a great thing for some people and some situations; I just try to avoid it if I don't feel that it's completely necessary for me.  So does this type of thing change or get worse with age?  What other sort of non medication type things can I do to keep it from getting worse?

Thank you guys for reading this.  If nothing else, it helps to get this off my chest and talk to you guys about it.  Sorry if I rambled.  I appreciate your time.",['compound'],0,neu_vader

See, I take my medication faithfully. It has made me gain weight, and it certainly doesn't solve every problem, but without it I'm sure I'd be dead by now. During all of the good days I have, I know that it's not due to me getting better, but it's the medication just doing its job. Now, to those of you who do get convinced that you are getting better and go off your medication, how do you convince yourself of that, especially after the first or second time? Don't repeat episodes of mania/depression indicate to you that it's just the medication working? Honestly, because I've never questioned this I almost feel like I can't possibly be Bipolar. It almost seems like it's a symptom every Bipolar person has. 

Again, I wan't to stress that I am in no way trying to be offensive or sound offensive. I'm just very curious. Thank you for any input you might have.

I spent a lot of time camping with my friends outside of a music and arts festival, and I feel so much better.

I think that was something I had been missing for a while, I was so caught up in what my mind was doing and how my life was going that I forgot about balance in my heart. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that things can feel better. If you are depressed or manic or just blah, as I have been so very many times before, know that you are fighting for a reason and that reason is this crazy beautiful life we are given. Get outside, watch a sunset, breathe some fresh air. Or take a quite moment to mediate. It doesn't have to be about God or religion or anything else. It just has to be about you and letting go of the fear and the self judgement and the weight of the world that holds you down.

Things can and will get better, and that is something I would have never believed in my darkest moments. So if you are in a moment of darkness take a second to find even just a little hope, and know that we are all in this together, and the power of love and life are stronger than any disease could ever be.

The jist of it is my SO of 9 years and I have been going through a very difficult time. I've been running away from a bipolar diagnosis but have gone with therapy. I have chronic pain and take lots of meds. I have NO libido after having surgery in my cervix. It makes me feel broken, like I'm not human anymore. My docs say it's normal considering my mental health, chronic pain, and all the meds I take fore these ailments. And apparently the sex has been decreasing for years and I can't do enough to satisfy my SO who was way into porn for so many years.

The first time I attempted suicide was after a fight my SO and I had. I stormed out- I planned on killing myself but all I could do was think of my SO. So I came home and caught him watching porn. It was the straw that broke the camels back. I took an overdose.

Ever since then my SO has been blaming me for not being able to let him be a man and do things that ""all men do"" which is watch porn and look at girls on FB and IG for hours a day. He has a high libido, always has, and it frustrates him sexually that I have no libido or desire to fuck him. That I haven't been giving him enough sex and in turn it makes him feel like I'm not paying attention to him which makes him feel insecure. He has gained a lot of weight and blames it on me for not making him feel like a man. That he has been so sexually frustrated because of me. All the mean while he is still creeping girls on social media because I can't give him what he wants. He yells at me when I try to talk to him and of course it always turns into a screaming match.

There were times in the past where he has sexually assaulted me and even though I hate to admit it- that I was raped a few times as well. Often he just wants to fuck, and when we did have sex we never made love. this brought out past rape trauma and i have been experiencing PTSD. I am on a waiting list for therapy for this. but it's not good enough for him.

I left to NY to see a friend for 5 days and the day I left he called me a slut and was angry cuz I was going to see a guy friend and he said I just wanted to fuck him. I don't want to fuck anyone, not even myself. The whole trip he was arguing with me on FB about how sexually frustrated he is and that i should give him credit for trying to stop his use of porn despite his many slip ups.

Now I'm back my friend offered for me to stay with her. As much as a good idea it is, I don't want to. I feel suddenly overwhelmed, trapped, and suicidal. I don;t want to live anymore. And not just because of my SO, in general. I'm gonna be suffering the rest of my life. The best I can do is ""manage"" the pain. I don't want to ""manage"". I don't want ot be alive. i dont want nothing but darkness and silence for ever.

For any of you who expressed interest in my keto diet, here you go!

Day 1: It appeared pretty easy, to be honest. I wasn't really craving anything, just sort of let down because I wouldn't really be able to eat all my favorite foods. I only ate 22 g carbs. I was aiming to stay under 20 g, but I was satisfied.

Day 2: I started having headaches and started having a lot of cravings for fruit and bread. I was doing fine for most of the day, then at around 10 PM I broke down and ate a few slices of bread and my mother had bought me an ice cream cone. I ended the day with 104 g carbs. Oops.

Day 3: I was doing well. Still having some fruit cravings, but I managed most of the day. Until someone brought home cookies. I ate them in shame. 70 g carbs.

Today (Day 4): I'm doing well. I'm only at 18 g carbs and I've lost about 13 lbs since starting this diet. Most of it is water weight, of course, but my shirts are fitting better and it's really motivating me to keep going.

Overall, I know there will be minor setbacks every once in a while, but I hope I can stick with it until I reach my target weight (160 lbs, currently 215 lbs).

If anyone is planning on trying it, do your research, but you can also ask me or head over to /r/vegetarianketo or /r/keto.

I require myself to drink at least 2 L of water a day. I try to stay under 20 g Net carbs (total carbs - fiber), but as long as I stay under 50 g I consider it a successful day :)

I do feel better, but I think it's mostly because I'm seeing results already. I also haven't been on a stable medication combo yet, for what it's worth.

Each day I've gone in (twice) I've thrown up four-five times in the morning.  The second day I had to leave because I was pale, shaking, and sick to my stomach.  I was supposed to go in today but contacted them after getting sick for an hour and a half.

When I left work the second day they were really understanding (I just said it was a medication problem), and today when I texted my boss.  They want me just to start on Monday, which gives me some time to sort this out.  I think the Trileptal I'm on (600 mgs) is doing this.  I missed half a dose the first day of work, then a full dose the second day, which sent me into a SPIRAL yesterday.  I woke up sick, went to my psychiatrist and just started crying on the way there.  I couldn't stop all through the appointment, then I went to my mom's house and cried for like four hours.  I told her I didn't want anything to ever happen again, like if life was a party I wanted to hide in the metaphorical bathroom until it was over.  She was so worried and I just couldn't stop and make her feel better, which I feel so guilty about.  I got home and settled down with some trees, then went to my therapy appointment.  This calmed me down, helped me be less anxious about feeling not adequate at my job (my self confidence is shredded after being fired once and a fucked up relationship).  I know there's a learning curve and it won't be as scary when I know what I'm doing, monotonous even.

The problem is I'm physically SICK.  I have been up for an hour, tried to take pepto but I threw that up too (glorious pink bubbles).  I've got ginger tea now.  Opened a yogurt that I tried to force down my throat.  I feel dehydrated, exhausted even though I went to bed really early (i got almost nine hours of sleep).  Sort of like I swallowed a balloon full of acid and it's sitting under my ribs, like even thinking of food makes me sick and hungry at the same time.

It doesn't help that I've been losing weight for months and months now.  I have a history of eating disorders, and losing too much weight can be very dangerous for me.  I gained a lot of weight during my bad relationship (like 40 pounds) and then just started shedding it as I went off birth control.  I haven't stopped though.  I got weighed at the doctor, as I don't keep scales in the house, and I'm close to dipping below the lowest healthy weight for myself.  Every time I throw up and then look in the mirror it's so close to what I felt and saw when I was dealing with my eating disorder that it makes me want to throw up again.  I feel skinny and weak all the time.  I used to love that feeling, like I was half-way between being alive and dead, but now it just makes me sad and scared.

I called my psychiatrist again this morning as she recommended yesterday I go off my Gabapentin in the hopes that it was causing me to get sick in the mornings.  Didn't work this morning, leading me to believe it's the Trileptal.  Both my psychiatrist and my therapist think it's nerves making it worse too.  My anxiety is a huge problem for me, which I know.  I now know I don't have to go in to work until monday, but my stomach still feels like...I don't know, like I'm clenching it?  I hope the weekend will be long enough for me to feel better.  Trileptal's one of the only things that has worked for my racing thoughts, it's kept me from getting manic and made my anxiety better in many ways.  I can reason things out now where as before I'd just get scared.  At least most of the time I can.  I still feel like this is an insane, uphill battle that I've been fighting for way too long.

How do you guys deal with physical illness vs mental illness?  I feel like they're really intertwined sometimes.

A friend of mine was recently hospitalized after a manic episode. I spoke with her on the phone when the episode must have been coming on, and thought something was ""off"", but chalked it up to extreme stress during finals. Didn't hear from her for two weeks, when I got an e-mail from her letting me know she had been stuffed in the hospital. Don't know what her mental state was like in those two weeks, but she was stable when I went to visit her and for another week of commitment afterwords until her release.

Visiting her in the hospital during that week was something I consider to be a soul-changing experience, but it was also very difficult. I can only begin to imagine how it was for her. The atmosphere of despair and sadness was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Hope was nothing but a cryptozooligcal beast, at best.

During her 3-week confinement, she was not once taken outside, given an ability to exercise, had to endure cold showers, and received a few creepy sexual comments from other patients. Not to mention the screaming and crying....oh good god, the screaming and crying. And then, when they would kick us out after exactly 1.5 hours, I could only hope the memory of the chicken matzo ball soup I had prepared would help her get through the next day- I could do NOTHING to help her besides a phone call. All electronics were banned; I had no way of providing her with music of any sort. When I asked her about music, she told me they had Celine Dion and Frank Sinatra in the ""activity room"" - to which I replied, ""that doesn't really count."" 

I am not a mentally ill individual, and I genuinely think after 2-3 days in the environment I would start to develop psychological scars, weird institutional behaviors, and depression. 

I worked in group-hope type situations for a few years in college taking care of a mentally retarded/developmentally disabled population. There were a lot of mental health spillover, even though MR/DD was the main classification of the individuals. Of the two agencies I worked for, I'd classify one as ""exemplary"" and the other as ""average"". So before I visited her, I assumed the quality of care was as good, if not better than what was provided to MR/DD individuals.

While she was there, I brought a notebook so we could start planning development for a smartphone game. Am I wrong in thinking in that environment it's important to try to remain creatively engaged?


So my question is, to the Reddit /Bipolar community, what can I do, as a best friend, to keep her out of the hospital? Right now we're working on building a close support group of friends (this experience taught her who her true friends were..). She is very compliant with her medication regimen, and able to use cognitive exercises to bring herself down from less severe manic episodes. Would it have been possible, as a friend, to have helped her ground herself in the emergency room and avoid an involuntary comittment (or at least talk her into signing voluntary paperwork)? Does anybody have any experience with a situation where a friend was able to help mitigate a similar crisis situation? I noticed weird instituational behaviors and psychological damage after her stay that wasn't there before, and if there's anything in my power to go about business in a different way, I'm 110% willing to contribute. I see it as nothing short of helping a friend leave a life worth living.

For now, I'm helping her to navigate the paperwork and insurance issues, which can be overwhelming for anyone. Other than that, I try my best to keep the fire inside her alive. Loss of hope is the most crippling injury.

I make it clear to her that my support is not one-ended, and I'm gaining from supporting her as much as she is from receiving. If anything, I know she has my back, because you never really know what life could bring.

I consider mentally ill people, and especially those trapped in institutions, to be the bravest people I know. The battlefield soldier can desert, but those stuck in the day room in their blue gowns can't really do that. And they did NOTHING to deserve what they got.


The relationship dynamic is as so: I'm 28 and genetically male, she's 26 and genetically female. We've never been romantic or even close in that sense; it is very much an older brother/younger sister type relationship and we have fun working on projects together.

Tl;dr: Friend had a manic episode and got stuffed in a mental prison. I am a loving and willing friend ready to do anything reasonable. Suggestions, please.",['compound'],0,neu_vader

I feel panicked and my mind is all over the place. I just got next week's work schedule, and I only have one day off.

I've just made a strict schedule for myself regarding sleep and exercise, because I've gotten way off track taking care of myself. With this cold it is totally throwing off my sleep schedule. 

Ongoing issues I've been having include memory issues - I've always been forgetful, but I don't know if there is something more wrong with me, or if it's the medication. I'm supposed to go see a neurologist. I also got some bloodwork come back saying there's something autoimmune going on, so I have to go see a rheumatologist, but I've lost my health insurance because I can't afford to pay the premium. So now I'm in a holding pattern with everything. I have medical debt racking up so fast, I don't know what I'm going to do.

I can't concentrate at work. I try to think about why I care about what I do (it's something I've always been passionate about), but that doesn't help. There are lots of people in the office getting ready for a festival right now, and all I want to do is run away. Sounds are irritating and frightening to me.

Most days, I tell myself just keep moving forward, you don't have to be perfect, just keep going, but some days like this one, I panic about everything. Are people talking about me? Is it my fault my SO is in trouble at work (stupid office politics)? I can't handle stupid office politics. There's only one person who I don't get along with, and she makes my life a living hell. And my SO is her subordinate, which sucks.

I haven't been performing at work. My goal for today is to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing, and I'm having trouble even doing that. I usually only figure it out once something goes wrong. It's not that my job hasn't been thoroughly explained to me, I've been in this position for years, and have been able to my job until I had a mixed episode last winter. I feel like everything is falling apart. I can't focus or concentrate, and my mind is all over the place, or gets stuck in a loop, or repeats itself because I can't remember what I was just thinking. I have no money to take care of myself, but I'm sucking at work. I doubt I'll get fired, but sometimes I'm doing so badly that I'm not sure.

I am lucky enough that they typically give me flexible hours, and are understanding about my illness. But they don't know how severe it really is. I hide the worst symptoms because they may think I'm unfit for my job. They know I have bipolar, and that I have mood swings, but they don't know about the paranoia, how bad the memory loss is, confusion, and occasional catatonic states. They don't know about the twitching and shaking. What's worse is, where I work is a really tight knit community. Most of us live at work (not me, luckily), and we are all friends. This is a pretty rural area, and there isn't much social life outside of work.

I get confused when I'm stressed and have trouble recognizing where I am and who I'm with. I mean, I know in the back of my mind, but it seems unreal.

We were best friends growing up and we’re still extremely close to this day. Looking back, I always knew that he was going to be diagnosed with something someday, but due to parents who didn’t want to admit something was wrong, that diagnosis didn’t happen until he was well into high school. ‘Better diagnosed than not’ we agreed, and I was glad because I thought that he would finally get the help he needed. This has not been the case. 
 
Our parents went through a years-long, nasty divorce, and now my brother and I don’t live together. His depressive episodes keep getting worse, and I don’t know how to help him. My brother is a sensitive guy with very few friends. He dropped out of school to take care of his mental health, and he’s planning to return within a year (so he says.) When he’s not depressed, he’s a fun guy to be around. He likes to write. But when he’s depressed, he starts sending me 8, 10, up to 20 emails a day filled with his ramblings, anxieties, worries, and suicidal intents. 

Because of the divorce and general life bullshit, I’m not exactly in the best mental place either. But when my brother gets depressed, he tried to make me his counselor or therapist. He flatters me by talking about how smart I am and how I’m his best friend, and then he unloads all of his worries and concerns on me. The suicidal emails are the worst, because I never know if he’s serious (often he sends an email a few hours later saying something like ‘I was in a bad spot and impulsively said that, please forgive me.’ I do, he gets better, and then he’s fine for a few weeks or months before he starts doing this again. 
 
He also seems to have a problem with therapists. He’ll start seeing someone, will decide that they’re not good, and start seeing someone else within a few months. He’s gone through about 5 therapists in the past year and never elaborates on why he quits seeing the old ones. 
 
When I try to confront him about how he forces me to be his therapist, he sends expletive-filled emails and voicemails about how I’m not ‘nice’ to him, that he’s going to kill himself, that I’m an ‘insensitive sociopath’ that he never wants to see again, and so on. A few hours later he’ll send an apology. 
 
I want to help him, but I’m sick of having to shoulder all of his emotional baggage. I’m not his therapist and I never wanted to be. He gets what little benefit can be gained from this relationship, but he’s hurting me and can’t see it even when I point it out. I really want to help him, really I do, but it’s exhausting and keeps hurting me the longer this goes on. It seems like his depressive episodes keep getting worse, even though he's been doing the medication trial-and-error dance for a while. 
 
Can anyone here offer me some advice? Older siblings, especially. I'm at a loss.

I live in a relatively rural part of the US where we don't have very good access to psychiatrists.  In fact, I've never seen one despite asking for a referral multiple times and being on social security disability for an ""unspecified episodic mood disorder"" for the last 10 years.  I do see a psychiatric nurse practitioner for medication though.  Past dxed as major depressive disorder, dysthymia, an array of sleeping disorders, and currently treated as an unspecified type of bipolar disorder.  Some brief hypomanic periods I can identify which, in my opinion, were likely medication induced.  Extended periods which I now recognize as mixed states which also, in my opinion, were likely medication induced.  No history of psychosis or manic episodes.

I've been seeing a new therapist, a social worker, for several months.  I've had a troubling week so one of the things we talked about today were suicidal thoughts.  This is something I'm very comfortable talking about.  We also talked about my past suicidal fantasies when I'm very depressed.  I just enjoy the feeling that such fantasies give me when I'm in a certain state of mind.  Again, I'm comfortable talking about this because I'm not currently in this state of mind and have come to terms with the fact that something **huge** would have to change in order for me to actually hurt myself.  It's just not going to happen.

So, what about the homicidal fantasies I have when I'm extremely depressed?  Is this important for me to talk about?  I'm in a situation where, if I were subject to a 3 day psychiatric evaluation, I would have a **lot** to lose.  A lot.  At the same time, it might be important treatment-wise.  My concern is that if I reveal I've taken pleasure in homicidal fantasies that my therapist would feel obligated to start the involuntary commitment process, which in my state, would mean an automatic 3 day commitment for review.  I'm sure I'd be found to be no harm to myself or others after that 3 day period, but that 3 day period would **wreck** a number of things in my life.  Of course, it's not lost on me that if my therapist did start an involuntary commitment process, it would pretty much guarantee that I'd see a psychiatrist.  Something I've been trying to do for quite a while without success.  The irony.

Aside from a grade school scuffle, I've never hurt anyone.  I've also come to terms with the fact that, despite the pleasure I take in homicidal thoughts when I'm in a certain state of mind, I'm not going to hurt anyone unless something **drastically** changes.

Has anyone been in this situation?  What did you do and what happened?  Should I tell my therapist about these fantasies?  Keep in mind that I'm not currently having such fantasies.  ",['npadvmod'],0,neu_vader

medical dropped me on the 1st. even though ive been covered the last 3 years, no they say my family makes too much money (nothing changed. in fact there is $500 less because of a garnishment). wish that were true. in reality the gross income is just above the cutoff. but after taxes and a terrible lien from the state there is barely enough for food. ok but this isn't about the money problems just a background on why im not going to be covered any more.

so this is what im looking at: zyprexa and depakote withdrawal. LUCKILY before this started i was already weaning off zyprexa. im down to half a 2.5mg a night. was psyching myself up for the final stretch since its been 8 weeks at this dose. but when i went to refill my depakote i found out the problem.

okay ive already figured out that zyprexa withdrawal is HELL. i tried cold turkey off 2.5 and quickly found out that was not goin to work, hence the careful weaning.

now this happened and i googled depakote withdrawal and they are saying nausea and no appetite which is exactly what zyprexa is doing. FUCK. i was really relying on depakote to help me with the zyprexa withdrawal and now im going to have double effect.

and what really scares me is the other symptoms for depakote withdrawal include seizures even if you never had them (coupled with the scary zyprexa muscle spasms this sounds even more fucked)

also of course listed for both meds withdrawal symptom is what it was treating. so on top of all the other shit a bipolar episode is lurking in the shadows as well.

i have 1 dose of depakote, med help center is closed til monday. as much as i hate them thank god i actually have 60+ zyprexa 2.5s so if shit starts getting weird i can tranquilize myself before i run naked in the streets thinking im jesus. (type one manic psychosis here).

please write back with anything i dont really know what help im looking for just mostly needed to share my story because my family is supportive but not so good with serious shit like this. not their fault it would just stress them too much. i know you guys can handle it so thats why im talking to you :)

oh ya this is a throwaway account sorry but i will be using it.

TL;DR About to hit double withdrawal from zyprexa + depakote. have a supply of zyprexa but no depakote. scared as fuck.


EDIT: thanks for all the responses. i've had a chance to calm down. i have a little bit of depakote now to help wean. really i think this was a freakout because i was going to lean on the depakote as a crutch while i went through zyprexa withdrawal and now i cant. oh well fuck em time for a clear head. thanks again.",['compound'],0,neu_vader

By the time they open again, I won't have worn it for about a week and a half. I am supposed to wear it 30 days... The last time I sent them my heart monitor readings, the guy on the other end freaked out. Apparently my heart was going way, way too fast when I felt my BP dropping. I figured that since my blood pressure was dropping when I did too much cardio, my  heart rate would be slowing too. I guess that isn't the case. My hands are still really shaky. Over the last few years, I have had an incredible amounts of lab tests and x-rays, catscans, MRIs, etc done.

On top of that, I think I am going to fail all of my classes this quarter. I know I am definitely going to fail two, and I am not sure if I can pass the third. I keep missing them because of how many doctors' appointments I have. I also miss class because I am so depressed I can't leave my bed, even to eat. I feel like a failure. My doctors practically demanded that I at *least* lower college to part-time (though they would feel better if I temporarily dropped out) and my family/SO has been wanting me to do the same. So I am finally filling out the paperwork to do that, though I hate having to do that. I feel awful, and pathetic. I can't work, I can't go to school, I can't do anything anymore. And some of my financial aid reversed, so now I have to take out another $1,000+ in loans.

At least my bipolar disorder is getting under control. My moods are stable, but I am constantly depressed. My anxiety and paranoia are through the roof. The littlest things can send me into melt-downs or panic attacks. My hands are shaky. Life sucks, and it is probably a combination of all the stress in my life and the bipolar disorder. The meds seem to be helping, and my memory loss is going away, so the meds side effects are getting better. Unfortunately, I am on Lamictal right now, and I have noticed something that looks in between a rash and stretch marks slowly growing on my chests, breasts, back, thighs, and butt. I originally thought it was just stretch marks, as I was also on Zyprexa and I gained 40 lbs. But I was taken off that, and have been steadily losing weight, but the ""stretch marks"" are still spreading. I have contacted my doctor to see if I need to get that checked out, but he is out of office right now, so I left a message.

Life has just been beating me down really badly. I am a failure who can't even pass college, am always at the doctors or hospital, and can't even get a new job (my last got rid of me because my medical problems were too much and they didn't want me fainting on the floor again) since I am always at appointments, the hospital or school.

She is selfish, inconsiderate, and irresponsible; examples include her staying up until 5 in the morning on a weeknight, drunk and yelling at the top of her lungs, getting into physical confrontations with the neighbors, stealing people's things, eating others' food, bullying just about everyone, etc. the rest of us work 8-6 hours, so her antics are fucking with our sleep and stress levels.  Icing on the cake is that she is a bigot -- she says the most inappropriate racist, classist, homophobic things and finds them to be hilarious. She talks about herself in a slightly delusional manner -- how amazing she is, what a genius she is, how beautiful she is... You get the picture. She is in her mid-30s and is constantly belittling our 22-year-old roommate. Her mother still pays for her rent and phone bill. She can be quite charismatic at times, yea, but now all of us are just sick of her shit. 


&amp;nbsp;

She received some criticism yesterday and totally lost it. We left her alone and she went nuts, screaming like a wild animal and ripping the couch apart / throwing shit all over the living room. When no one went in to check, she stormed out to go to a bar. In the middle of the night (more like near dawn) we hear her come storming down the hall, stomping her feet and letting out these insane guttural screams/yells. She proceeds to throw shit everywhere around the house, yelling to herself before trying to break into our other roommate's room. When she doesn't let her in, she yells again before going to her room. The girl in the room adjacent to hers told us that she was throwing shit around for the next hour or two before passing out. She also heard the cat yowl loudly, so we think she might have tried to hurt him, which is something we definitely wouldn't put past her. 

&amp;nbsp;


After all of that, she ate a bunch of people's food today and has just been sulking in her room. One of my roommates has decided to move out because she just can't deal with this. Our landlord seems lreluctant to do anything because, you know, crazies. We're kind of worried because, as crazy as she can be, she's never actually gone thaaat far before. 


&amp;nbsp;

Long story, but do you guys think that could have been a manic episode? We do think she may be bipolar, as she's told us about how she'd been put on a 48-hour hold before (which she thought was hysterical) and how she's been put on lithium and seroquel in the past due to a ""totally clueless"" doctor. Either way, she declares that she doesnt need ""fat girl"" meds like that, and will only take her Adderall and Xanax (of which she needs to take an entire bar to go to sleep) that she convinced some GP to prescribe to her. 


&amp;nbsp;

My question is : should we be scared? She has no boundaries, but we don't know if she'd actually physically assault one of us. We do know she finds some sort of weird pleasure out of making people's lives miserable (again, hysterical) so we're wondering how we should proceed as the landlord figures everything out. As of now, she thinks that we are all just bummed at her and has no idea that some of us are legitimately scared.

He didn't know that I had attempted suicide this week, or that I was in the ICU and saw another psychiatrist who wanted to work with me for a better approach. Oh and the new psych gave me a new diagnosis of PTSD thanks to a long line of childhood trauma. He releases me, seeing how it was situational and thought I should see him outpatient the next day or so, I wasn't able to so I saw my original pdoc and explained what happened. 

I explain that I attempted by downing a lot of Elavil. That they admitted me into ICU for observation and medication and what not. I come out alive and okay, feeling stupid as fuck to be honest. 

After I explain he goes on this rant. I shit you not it went something like this: 

""So you took all your bullets and used them, and now you're coming back for more bullets? How can I trust that you just won't down the whole bottle of Lamictal or Topamax? Here's some prozac to help with the depression. (That along with the Topamax and Lamictal is all he wrote for me, other pdoc suggested benzos, prazosin, no ssri's, etc.)"" He then goes on to add this gem in, "" You're not as special as you think or feel you are. If you die, two weeks from now no one will notice, no one will care. If I died my girlfriend would be out looking for another man at the mall in two weeks. No one would visit your grave, think how many times have you visited a loved one's grave (very lucky to have lost only a few people ""close"" to me but still, cmon). I'm not trying to belittle you but those people are gonna get up and eat breakfast the next morning, I'll eat breakfast that morning. We see people kill themselves all the time, they're just another check-mark on a piece of paper...."" 

**EDIT** I make a last ditch effort to mention Prazosin to him, and I shit you not this was his response ""That drug only works 10% of the time and if you down the whole bottle it will kill you..."" And then he mentioned something about deformed babies (but I am not trying to get pregnant anymore and it's recorded in my damn chart. UGH.) 

He went on for another 5 minutes. I left bawling. I know I did this to myself but seriously? I get home, after seeing the new office for my new doc and kinda getting a feel for it and most importantly making sure I felt comfortable again forgoing treatment. They were wonderfully kind, understood what was going on, had my discharge papers in order (from the ICU) and my intake papers ready. And my apt isn't until next Wednesday! I can't wait, seriously. 

I get home and finally healthgrades.com this asshole. Turns out he has his license indefinitely suspended in North Carolina, and only got his license in New Mexico if he completed a drug rehab program.

I posted a few days ago [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1xl7w2/i_done_fucked_up_now_im_in_chinaneed_advice/) about how I ended up in China teaching English after a flurry of manic activity.  I mentioned that at the time of posting I was feeling ""normal"" but that I could tell an episode of some kind was on its way.  I was right.

I believe I'm currently in the middle of a very powerful mixed state--all the depression with all of the energy and racing thoughts that won't shut up.  I know I am not thinking clearly.  I keep seeing bright movement in my periphery. This is the worst or second worst episode I've ever had. And I tell one thing: it's still early--it's only just begun.  Things have stopped feelign real. Yesterday, I had a mild panic attack in the school and had to hide for a while before I was presentable. I had another, slightly worse one this morning on the way to work, and a massive, gasping, groaning one the moment I got home. It was perhaps the most acute I've ever experienced. When it slowly abated, and I could catch my breath I felt the skin on my face tingling.  It was strange--I've never experienced this before.

I was just told yesterday that they're giving me a roommate tomorrow.  One of the things that happens when I get into a serious episode is I get severe social anxiety. Actually, it's a relatively new thing. The social anxiety pair-up started less than two years ago, but it's a reliable part of my bipolar episodes now.  I know where this is going. In 48-72 hours I won't be able to be around people without something happening in my head.  I don't know what will happen. I'm getting worse as I get older and I can't predict these things very well anymore--each episode is a little worse than the last.

So, I've been talking to my gf. (This is really hard to write). We've been together for 7 years. The way our relationship is set up we're partners, like married folk.  She's been the most wonderful and supportive person in my life, ever.  But I've had to lean on her a little too much the past 2 years a I've gotten worse. With me gone the past 5 weeks she admitted that she doesn't really miss me the way she feels she should.  She's enjoying being able to do what she wants without having to worry about how I'll react, and without having to wonder if I've done the dishes/laundry/garbage/paid the bills/etc.  I've never been the angry type, but I can get sulky. And I often need her to be around me when I'm depressed. When I'm manic I push her away and/or abandon my half of the household responsibilities.  As I've gotten worse, I've become more of a burden.  She ""still loves me"" and ""misses cuddlign on the couch watchign movies and going places having adventures"" but she doesn't ""miss"" me at home.  

I've told her that I'm ready to come home and get real help for my mental health. That I'm ready to go to regular therapy and be put on whatever meds the docotrs say. I'm ready to get better for myself and for her and the relationship.  It doesn't sound like she's totally against repairing the relationship, but she doesn't seem totally for it either.  I asked her to imagine all the cuddling and the adventures and the good stuff minus the emotional baggage. SHe said she thinks she might like to see that. She seems to be teetering on the precipice.  I know **I know** that if I come home and get help things will get better.  But I don't know if she wants me to come home.

I don't have anywhere else to go.  I can't go to my mother's (estranged), father's (literally psychotic wife won't let me in the house), or my aunt's (she has an overful apartment takign care of other family already) and my only friend who knows what's up with me lives with two cats (I'm seriosly allergic).  I want to go home and I want to get help and I want to fix my relationship with the most important person in my life, but I don't want to be selfish.

I **need** to go home.  If I start crying in front of the kids, that would be worse than if I just didn't show up at all--and I'm getting to that point.

**Question time:**

I was thinking of calling my gf and asking her if she could just agree to 3 months. That I come home and she agree to work on it for 3 months while I get help and tryo to become the partner she deserves again (I was a good partner once upon a time).  I need to know if I have a place to go home to and I also think that ""knowing"" I have a 3 month ""saftey window"" will do wonders for my sanity.  3 months for me to hopefully get my mental health recovery on track with a support system, and 3 months to try to be the boyfriend I was 2 years ago.  If she still feels better without me there then okay, I will figure out something else and we go our sperate ways (her concern is that when I'm home it's ""very easy to be comfortable"" with me, and she's worried that if I come home she'll just be happy with me there even if it's not in her absolute best interests). I can't tell: is this selfish or okay to ask her? 

Is it even possible to repair this relationship? 

Tickets home are insanely expensive but I need to be somewhere safe right now.

After figuring out it's probably more than a depressive phase- and having done a couple appointments with my psychiatrist who doubted it was med-based, I saw my primary care. He did a bunch of lab tests, but thought it was med-induced.

So basically my medication M.D. and my regular hey-doc-I-gotta M.D blamed each other.

However, **we start with Lamictal** finally (I was 21 and thus unlikely to get The Rash or serious side-effects), and taper off Abilify and Topamax. I'm only taking Pristiq and Lamictal now.

So here's where it gets a lot worse- the labs showed an increased Cardio RP and Sed rate- so it was likely an infection that wasn't bad enough for me to go directly to a doc.

As a meds solution, we tripled my Pristiq (to 150mg, a very unusual dosage). I shot right out of my depressive phase, but 

a) it was too much Pristiq and we didn't know really how long it needed to be high, and

 b) I was recovering from my illness, so I was getting naturally more perky.

**Thus about February** we have a pretty bad hypomanic phase- accelerated heartbeat caused by Pristiq, way too much energy, and bad sleep continuing. 

Paranoid tendencies (some of which you can see on my Reddit history) and irritability were noticeable. I go back on Abilify- 5mg from cold turkey. It hurts like hell, bad twitches and joint pain. Some rather scary med-include eczema- never a good thing on Lamictal.

I still can't sleep well- maybe a month with bad sleep. I start to deteriorate more and more- going out at night, incoherence, thinking about spending a lot of money and making strange plans for the future.

So long story short:

* We **dumped Abilify**- always a troublesome medication for me.

* **Replaced that with Seroque**l, which got me much more sedate.

* Jacked up the Lamictal to where it was before the eczema.

* And **added the L-dawg, the Periodic Numbah Three- lithium**.

I'm calmer, more coherent, and sleep better now. Still a bit too sedate to listen to people for long periods of time, and have only driven once with someone else in the car to make sure I don't space out.

Lithium labs on Monday, then we'll tweak what we have.

Things are generally better! I feel this is making me less erratic and annoyed by people. :D","['appos', 'amod']",0,neu_vader

I do not mean to be misleading, but...  
 
While being BP1 isn't bad enough, 20+ years ago my behavior was such that trying a new way to get coke into my bloodstream didn't seem like a bad idea.  
Yup, it was a bad idea.  


I found out from the caring people at the Red Cross some years later that I have Hepititus C and was no longer an acceptable blood doner.  
 
Through the years I have been repeatedly told not to use the current cure for Hep C as it is super-wicked-uber-mega-collossally contra-indicated for my bipolar.  
  
Fast forward to December 2013 and I have Jaundice. It was brought on by the mixture of bipolar meds (Do not take Tegretol if you are not healthy, just my experience) and painrelief meds I started just over a month before.  
After an ultrasound and several bloodtests later I find out the virus is having a field day with my liver and cirrosis has begun.  
  
Yeah, yeah, so far this should be in /r/hepc but the bipolar thing starts here, that was background for people not to make similar mistakes.  

I never thought I had it so good just being bp1.  
The side effect of the new Solvaldi/Ribivarin treatment are getting harder for me to bear.   
Now I have rapid cycling, always waiting for something to piss me off, haven't been in a consistant good mood for weeks. (I am in month 3 of 6 month treatment, I have been going downhill mentally  since the second month)   
I keep running the ""fucking shut my brain off!!"" options through my head every time I cycle into depression which is about 3 times a day.  
 
I can stop the treatment which = an early death  
I can admit myself to hospital which = cut off from cure treatment then I won't need the hospital and most likely not get back on treatment then = early death  
Or just off myself and save a lot of paper work.   

I do not say these things lightly, but at the same time I have no wish to die either, I just want all of this to end but it won't, not for 3 more months.   
 
It only sucks while I am going through it.  
Everything is transitory.  
Things will get better.  
  
My mantra for the next 3 months.  


And just yesterday I was an inch away of beating up a homeless guy for pissing me off.  
He could have been anyone, I had that mood going on.

No they don't. There are no simple fixes in life to my emotions and problems. I have tried searching for them, my whole life, thinking if I did blank or pursued blank that it would fix everything. It won't and it never does and this pain inside of my mind just never ends.

I scare myself. I am afraid that one day in one of my episodes, which usually consists of anger, anxiety, and irritation, that I have went too far many times- that one day I am going to go REALLY too far (as in violent), and it scares me.

I have hurt my loved ones so much, and then by doing that I just end up hurting myself. On top of my bipolar I just have so much anger inside of me from having an abusive childhood and I still struggle with memories of it everyday.

Anti Depressants, Mood Stabilizers, Tranquilizers, Stimulants, the list goes on. My psychiatrist says, almost in a joking way but not really cause it's true, ""You've been through every medication in the pharmacy, there is nothing more!"" I've pretty much given up on the pharmaceutical system over 7 years. The best medication in my opinion, and this is such a grey area, medical marijuana. The grey area especially so in Bi-Polar I. That being said it's worked for me, and there is a reason others with Bi-polar say it works for them. I'll leave that topic off clearly stating street drugs and mood disorders in general do not mix. Anyways with all that being said I've been off all pharmaceutical medications for the passed 9 months. In that time things have become much more manageable for whatever reason

I usually experience cycles of hypomania, agitation, anxiety and depression. The article in the link posted below is how I have been effectively managing my Bi-Polar I with something called the Candida Diet and some porbiotics. Some doctors discredit it to a degree because ""Science hasn't proved anything YET about this"". But it's brand new, I can't help but argue why people shouldn't try this so I did and because of it, I have a pretty clear idea microbe gut biology is the answer to many mental health disorders, including my Bi-Polar I. I am not effected by my daily mood swings unless I break my dietary habbits and/or stop taking probiotics.

I got turned onto the idea from 2 or 3 sources in the same week, one of them being my parents. New research may indicate gut bacteria could be a source of mental illness. I tried Kombucha (which has probiotics) to start but it actually contains sugar that is counter productive to the process. Unflavored yogurt and kefir also have moderate amounts of probiotics. Now I basically eat a gluten free diet, but its even a little more strict on restricting sugar intake. The diet and probiotics I take flush my system with all the old toxic bacteria and replace it with healthy bacteria essential for not only brain functions but plenty of other human functions.

Here are a couple articles from reputable sources briefly explaining gut microbe biology and its correlation with mood:

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/magazine/can-the-bacteria-in-your-gut-explain-your-mood.html?_r=0

http://www.cbc.ca/news/gut-feeling-how-intestinal-bacteria-may-influence-our-moods-1.2701037


From my understanding there is also a book called ""Brain Maker"", a friend of mine told me of it, and apparently it's all about gut microbe biology and how it effects human function.

If you have any questions about my case, or have read Brain Maker and think you could share some knowledge please email me or leave comments. I'd love to hear from others who have tried this themselves for mental health and or other reasons.

Below is the link to my article of how I personally think Bi-Polar 1 can be treated and possibly cured by diet. It also includes my opinions on Bi-polar 2. It's worth a read especially if your interested and actually keep up on knowledge about new treatments for Bi-Polar and other mental illness.

After that, i was given the chance to continue university in that country, a chance I took. Lonely, overworked, I went through it...  Graduated, went back home, got a job, got diagnosed, went back again for grad school

We all swim on this sea called life. I think if I had stayed home I would have been most likely to end it soon. A few weeks ago I saw a kid I used to go to college with but could never talk to. We had such a nice conversation now. Things are different for him and me, but maybe mostly for me. My face muscles didnt hurt from the stress this time...

Edit: I wrote that on my cellphone after I was invited for lunch, and as soon as I showed up, my party left (saying it was late) and left me alone, with a plate of cold food on the table, and my bill to pay.

   I was recently diagnosed with bipolar II (I think? It was the less severe type.) a few months ago. I'm currently taking 3x250mg of Depakote in the morning and half a cilexa at night. 
    
   Anyway, I get REALLY bad (suicidal) depression that lasts from about the end of October until well into Spring. The depressions have been getting worse every year. I haven't gone through a winter with my current med setup, so I don't know how I'll respond, but I'd like some tips on what I can do to keep my depression as mild as possible. Including diet, fitness, health, meditating, massage, meds to talk to my doc about, whatever. I was almost hospitalized last winter and I'd rather not go through that again. Thanks!",['ROOT'],0,neu_vader

- She was apparently depressed once (though never diagnosed) and thought her way out of it, so I should do the same;

- I don't 'seem like I have bipolar disorder', so my psychiatrist is wrong;

- I've had to change medications a lot - mostly before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so we were trying to treat the wrong thing - so all psychotropic drugs are obviously a scam perpetrated by Big Pharma;

- There are 'proven' natural remedies for bipolar disorder;

- Similarly, bipolar disorder is 'caused by a lack of vitamins and minerals';

- My suicide attempts were not genuine or something(???) because depression is not an actual illness;

- Similarly, all mental illnesses are labels created by those in the medical field of mental health to ensure income, so it's impossible for one to be chronic; and

- It is my fault that I have bipolar disorder, as I could 'work my way out of it' at any time.

I'm sure there's some other gems I'm forgetting. I am just not sure how to deal with this. I have tried to explain that depression and bipolar disorder are not the same, and that her depression is obviously different to my experiences with dysphoric episodes, but she will not listen. I don't know what to say to her. I'm furious.",['dative'],0,neu_vader

Just recently I noticed myself doing some serious crashing and burning, so I stopped drinking. Few weeks later I met with a psychiatrist and he was pretty quick to diagnose me.

Since these it's be a whirlwind of emotions. I picked up a book called ""The Survival Guide to Bipolar Disorder"" and that's helping me a lot as I sort through my emotions. Last night I tried racking my brain to figure out who I used to be, before I felt ill. Was I always this moody? Was I always rude, irritable, a  hurricane of emotions? I don't think so, but it's so hard to remember back. I did come across something interesting though. It's called the Scar Hypothesis- basically it says that over time hospitalization, depression, manic episodes, medication, psychotherapy, and painful events can so fundamentally change a person even after the depression is gone. It made me wonder if I'll ever be the same person I used to be again.

I started taking Lithium last week. I'm on day 7 and no real side effects yet (300mg), however I noticed my memory is starting to get foggy. Today I tried remembering when I saw my therapist last. Was it yesterday? The day before? Maybe last week? I actually had to call and ask when my last appointment was because I was so frustrated trying to figure it out. It was yesterday, how did I forget that? Sometimes I'm even forgetting when I ate last, or which way to turn the wheel of my truck when I'm backing out and trying to go a certain way. It's so bizarre and confusing. 

Anyway, I'm rambling. This is my first post in the sub and it just seems like such a great community to vent and to support. I appreciate all those that read this.",['conj'],0,neu_vader

My therapist worked it out with my insurance so I can also still see her once a week even though I am in IOP. So glad. I'm excited about that. My therapist did kind of chew me out for not fully sharing stuff at IOP and holding it all in until our Tuesdays' sessions. She will only see me from now on if I use all my resources to their fullest extent. Including sharing at IOP and with Mallorie, my social worker. She doesn't understand, it's all new, it's all scary, and these people aren't her! Ugh! I'm trying!

Geodon was bad for me, a really bad medicine for me. Made my depression so much worse. I'm now on 5mg of Haldol instead of 80mg of Geodon. Haldol seems to be working over all though it's only been a week. Yesterday I was put on 15mg of Remeron. I have been apathetic and going days without eating. I been depressed for awhile even before the Geodon so hoping this will help. It helped with my sleep last night now if I will eat again and have a sense of caring again.

So Haldol 5mg, Benadrly 50mg, Lexapro 30mg, Vyvanse 60mg, Restoril 30mg, Vistaril 50mg (twice a day), Remeron 15mg, and 1mg Klonopin PRN as needed for severe anxiety or panic. I only get seven of those like every two weeks. Hoping this cocktail will work!

About 2 weeks ago, I aired a short list of grievances after crying in a bathtub, and I managed to get it out of my system, go to work, and have a good day.  It seems everyone around me IRL is depressed if not suicidal.  Seeing as how I'm open with my diagnosis, they seem to come to me to advice I'm not qulaified to give.  I try to calm them down, and get them to seek treatment, but that's not what they want, they want a quick fix ""because I'm doing so well!"". Yeah, well that took time, effort, and more time.  It's been about 7 years since I was diagnosed, and I sort of knew I was before it was confirmed, but I'm not liking my new role as the go to girl, when I barely have a handle on things myself half the time.

     Last summer I had my gall bladder out, and it was supposed to be a simple operation and a speedy recovery.  HA!  I feel worse now then I ever did before.  I was in so much physical pain for so long, I actually didn't have any bipolar symptoms. Well, maybe a few, but with that much physical pain to focus on, it was a distraction to say the least.  My family doctor and various specialists agree there's something going on, and the gall bladder wasn't my main problem.  There's a good chance I have Crohn's or something like it.  Even with good health insurance, I can't afford the constant doctor visits, tests, and meds (that don't seem to do jack shit).  I was more or less fine from Thanksgiving until the middle of April, and now I'm back to sharp pain, not being able to keep food in or down, and fatigue.  It sucks.  My eyes and joints are in agony, and I just turned 30, wtf?
     My fathers staying with me and my husband...it's going better then last year, but I'm on edge.  My husband likes my dad, but this is the 3rd time in 7 years he's stayed for an extended period of time.  His divorce from my mom left him with all of $550 a month in social security.  To his credit, he's been traveling the world and meeting people, living out of a carry on bag.  But, how do you tell a parent you love ""get out, you're kind of fucking up my marriage?""  My husband and father like each other, and respect each other to an extent, but it leaves me in an awkward fucking position.  We told my Dad, one month, which is the month of May.  He's now making plans in June.  Not cool.  But I'm so exhausted and fear conflict, so I've been putting off telling him that at the end of the month he has to go.  
Ona final note of my update, seeing as you all seem like nice people, to help make ends meet I took a job as a fetish model. I love it, it's so much fun.  I thought about it for about 2 months before I signed the contract, my husband fully supports the idea, and close friends and family know.  It's not a secret, I'm not ashamed (I smoke cigarettes, pop balloons, have pillow fights, and there's no nudity), but it's strange.  I'm getting fanmail from around the world.  It's surreal.  So, I do hair 3 days a week in my dream salon with an awesome boss, and have a side job 2 days a week as a fetish model, it's crazy, but in a good way.  It's hard to believe this is my life.  
So, even with all the mental, physical, family, and financial problems, I can say I'm doing pretty well all things considered.  I don't really know why I'm sharing this with all of you....I just wanted to talk and have someone who has no idea who I am IRL listen, even if only one or two people reas this, cool.  Bipolars not the end of the world.  I've been hospitalized, and think about offing myself more then I care to admit, but...I feel all super cliche saying you never know where life is going to take you, and for all the many sucky aspects, try to make the little things count.  I do, and it really, really helps.
     Sorry for typos, I took sleeping pills and they're not working...that's not a good sign, but I'm using the time to be productive around the house, and enjoy the peace and quiet while my husband and dad are asleep.

I can't stop crying, I've had constant thoughts of self-harm and suicide even though I thought I'd got over that, and had developed better ways to deal with those thoughts. I can't go back to the doctor because I'm terrified that if they give me another antidepressant, I'll just go right back up and bump my head on the moon again. The only thing keeping me going is the hope that whatever the last two weeks were (I don't actually remember any of it, the only accounts I have are from friends and family, who unanimously say I was acting completely out of character) can ultimately be sorted out. I've been discharged from the crisis team, because I'm no longer moonlighting as Mother Nature, and am now waiting for a referral to an actual psychiatrist (my case workers were mostly nurses because I was with my parents and therefore was unable to do anything serious enough to put myself at actual risk, and therefore warrant expensive inpatient treatment. God bless the NHS) and a formal diagnosis, and more information about what exactly that entails, medication and how to deal with my troll brain. In the meantime, I find myself wondering what the fuck went wrong and how I'm supposed to get up from this.

I'm 19 years old, am/ was attending a prestigious university and doing a degree I absolutely loved. (I've been advised to take a year out and change courses). All of the careers I was considering will now probably be off-limits to me because of the events of the last two weeks, and certain aspects of the course could cause quite a few problems for my future mental health. 

I just feel incredibly alone and terrified right now because it seems like my whole life is falling apart around me and I have no idea what to do, and it would be nice to speak to people who have been there, and know that it can and does get better.

I started sleeping less and was very excited and energetic about my new major and lifestyle(i wanted to be healthy work out alot and be a better person). All of my friends thought the change was good I was no longer a bum. However my mother (a social worker) knew something was wrong. We spoke a lot and I realized I didn't want to change my major and was getting everything back in order to what it was. Still had the good energetic mood though. My mom saw I still wasn't normal though and drove up to school and caused me a lot of stress. The stress made me more energetic and irritable. She ended up calling the police cause I wouldn't listen to her, which brought me to my hospitalization. At the hospital I was very irritable and didn't want to listen to any of my doctors, I thought I was there under my own will and just wanted to leave. I wasn't and when I found out went ape shit. All I knew was that I didn't want any more drugs in my body. So I refused all medication cause I didn't even know what they were treating me for. There were so many different doctors who would talk to me I couldn't remember anyones names, and wouldn't listen to anybody. I eventually gave up and just started taking whatever they gave me (lithium and respirdal). During my stay there I had a terrible short term memory and would leave shit everywhere. I got very paranoid of the other patients thinking some were even my own doctors. But even now that I'm out a month later, I still know or think something was fishy. A lot of my paranoia I think was justified and still is. Other patients messed with me at times and I couldn't take a joke in my state. I did eventually come back to myself and got released and am now staying at home for 2 months working a boring job, waiting to get back to school next semester. I have no depression and didn't at any point. I think if my mother didn't intervene I would have had a hypomanic episode at school.

Is it possible the whole experience was only brought on from a month long of smoking weed and 3 edibles in one night, and is it possible that I can avoid having another episode by never doing that again?

Have read stories of people saying stabilisers can work wonders and really help hypomania's but not so much with depression?

So first of all, I know you guys are probably wondering why I'm posting here instead of going to the doctors? Well, firstly I am in the process of seeking medication help, but there are limitations due to my current residence in order for me to get a psychiatric evaluation. Anyways, I don't want to go on too much so I'll get to the point.

I won't go into too much detail about my past. But I used to have crippling OCD from the age of 13-17, back then it had a lot of physical compulsive behavior. I still have OCD, but it is mainly mental compulsions. I've had severe depression, insomnia and anxiety all of my teenage years. However, I want to focus on the last couple of years in which gives rise to the notion of thought that I may have Bipolar. 

I suffer from very extreme daily mood swings, they can be quite drastic, one minute I can be fine and the next minute I simply feel suicidal and that my whole world is falling apart. I suffer from general irritability, I have trouble sitting still sometimes and especially when I'm trying to do school work. I mean it takes me extra HOURS to do assignments, in which others have ease with. In the last week I've been having anxiety attacks, I've been getting 1-2 hours sleep because my heart is racing so much. I've ALWAYS had racing thoughts throughout my head, depending on my mood. I've seemed to notice extreme episodes and periods of depression and sometimes I as if I fit the criteria of a 'mix mania episode', though these mixed episodes are only for a few days. The problem is that from my understanding someone with bipolar should be experiencing episodes that last for months. And well for me I experience heavy episodes of depression for months at a time, and there's been one or two months that I've randomly felt completely normal in the last two years. The thing I feel as if I don't fully fit the criteria for is a manic episode, I've felt as if I've experienced manic episodes for one to four days at a time, but I haven't experienced it for months at a time. 

I'm in desperate need at the moment, due to my mental health difficulties I'm incredibly behind. I have exams coming up and I have phenomenal amounts of work to do in order to prepare. But I'm unable to prepare because I have to spend hours battling my emotions, and I can have mental fatigue randomly throughout the day then I can suddenly be fine.

I do think I could potentially have Borderline personality disorder, I'm really not sure at this point and I'm incredibly stuck :(

I would appreciate any help given.
Thanks a lot.",['compound'],0,neu_vader

He's gone through hell and back over the last few years getting through the initial diagnosis, medication, etc.  He has been really good the last little while.  He's fun to talk to, rational, wants to learn and get life together, however I'm worried he's slipping into a manic episode.  

I think I now know what his mania looks like.  Conversations begin to feel jagged and awkward.  Often feeling as though he begins in the middle of a conversation.  He starts to ramble, and get scattered and unorganized, and his humour turns deranged.  He'll make up some rambling story about finding money under the tongue of a boy with syphilis or some such nonsense.  I guess he thinks it's funny, because in this state, he has no regard for who might hear these stories and seems to act like other people are in the wrong for not liking them.  I get the feeling that he just craves attention in this state, good or bad.  I saw him today, and he showed all of these symptoms when I tried to talk to him.  I talked to his parents and apparently he is no longer working, and has, on a number of  occasions, been out all night wandering around after going to parties and drinking or whatever.  Just tonight, my aunt and I called him to go get him from whatever party he was at, and he gave us an address we couldn't find and then we couldn't get a hold of him after that.  I'm going to call him as soon as I wake up and see if I can talk to him or something.  We're worried he isn't sleeping

Sorry about the stream of thought, but onto my question.  How do I talk to someone going through a manic episode?  Should I be direct and tell him ""You aren't making any sense."" Or should I try and ignore the obnoxious behaviour?  I really want to help my cousin, but I have no idea how to approach him when he starts derailing the conversation.  Any and all suggestions, or anecdotes are greatly appreciated.  ",['conj'],0,neu_vader

Obviously this is a throwaway account. We are both Redditors, my partner may even see this, but after reading the posts in this subreddit I figured I'd throw my story out there and see what advice other people in my situation could give me. 

My partner is bipolar, and we have always known, but she was recently diagnosed (rediagnosed really) after seeking out help and finally getting on meds. This all happened after I left about three weeks ago. In the 5 years we have been together she has cheated on me several times, twice with the same person, and up until the last time I forgave her for all indiscretions because I know about the mania and the fact that bipolar people have a tendency to cheat to satisfy it. She was always remorseful, apologetic, and regretful, so I always forgave her with the hope she could control it. The last year, however, I feel her manic episodes reached a level in which she could not control herself whatsoever. So, long story short, she cheated again with someone she has cheated on me with before, I reached my breaking point, and I left. 

Now she is seeking help, she is medicated, and she is doing much, much better. Therapy is allowing her to finally see why she has been behaving the way she has, and she is coming to terms with her illness and that therapy and meds are a lifelong commitment she has to make to stay stable. I love her with all my heart and support her decision to get help 100%, but I am scared this will all happen again one day. I want it to work, I really truly do. I can work with the mood swings, I can work with the healing, the ups and downs, but I can't work with the cheating. She wants it to work as well, and has done everything I asked her to do to get herself better since I left. 

So, I suppose what I am asking is if anyone here, whether the spouse, significant other, or the person who is bipolar themselves, has been in a similar scenario and what your outcome was.  I know redditors have a certain hive mind, so please refrain from the old ""gtfo while you can"" comments. I am just looking for similar scenarios and what the outcome was.

The problem is that I feel like I'm perpetually stuck interacting with people who get lost on the straight line I draw them in big black sharpie. I'm logical, methodical, grossly overeducated, and try to provide scientifically founded explanations and suggestions to people. I openly admit that I am a seeker of knowledge and love sharing it. I hate seeing people making uninformed decisions as.  So I'm baffled when I lay out a simple line of logic and people are lost and respond with vitriol and ignorance.

Example: I wrote an email to one of those daily deals type companies suggesting a feature that is available on the website but not the app - see what was removed from expired cart. Get reply about how the cart must be randomly emptied at x time so other shopper's can buy things. Replied, let's not all pretend that you haven't had the same items listed for months, you have stock, and placing an item in a cart does mean no one else can buy it, that's not how online purchasing works. Ergo, no reason to randomly empty the cart. But that's still not the point. The point is the janky app. Pass along the app suggestion that you can easily locate dropped items to the app Dev team. 

Why was it necessary to spell that out for said person? 

Example 2: ""used this shampoo and grew 3 inches of hair in a month"" posted on a board for people with trichotillomania. I explain all the scientific reasons this is unreasonable, explain sources of error in measuring hair length (mostly its stretchy and no one has hair all one length unless it's Flowbee'd or buzzed.) Also scientifically measured hair growth rates. Get accused of being negative, breaking spirits, hurting feelings. Counter that snake oil salesmen are alive and kicking, point out lack of critical thinking on their part, and willingness to try anything for a cure. Do your research, know that when things sound too good to be true they usually are, challenge these claims, stand up for your intellect, don't be pandered to. Don't fall victim to these charlatans. ""But it's ancient Chinese medicine that may be a possible treatment."" ""nothing lost by buying a bottle of shampoo""

Well actually yes, there is. You, with great and unsurpassed effort, continue to miss the point. Just put a giant target on your face and label it, fool. And while you're at it, let's possibly maybe but definitely perhaps consider the probability of maybe kinda sorta having some almost success at growing what could be 3 inches of hair in a month with a ""may be a possible treatment."" Because WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK?! Today it's shampoo, tomorrow it's vitamins, the next fad could be smearing coconut oil on your scalp.

However I have notice again something that I didn't notice at least 10 years ago. Is this two personalities that live inside of me.

I know that they both are me, however it is strange to me to see them  talking... one of them has a personality that makes him complain about the world and all the things in it. He seems to be ""touch"" by a lot of things, (traffic, other people, memories, ilusions). He will complain when something is not the way he liked it although sometimes he seems to make a bit deal out of nothing.

The other personality is what I like to call my inner Zen, he is a really relaxed person, like to find joy in the ""here and now"", knows that the world is the way it is and that I can only bring sadness to myself by trying to change the reality, he likes to listen, and be possitive about the outcome of things, he seems to not be bother by other people and always try to understand.

There is finally me, I'm the witness of both of these persons of my body. I know that one can not live without the other, I no longer hate my ""negative"" personality and embrace my ""inner Zen"", they both belong to me and I do my best to try to make them both grow out of the other.

I'm the force of will in myself I can make myself do things even when I don't feel like I want to, I operate this body, and I control it.

      I've been lurking here for a while and think it has been a good resource so far. Two weeks ago I was officially diagnosed with bipolar and everything has been a mix of good and bad since. I had been waiting for an official diagnosis for a while and now that I have it I can't seem to deal with it well. I was put on risperdal (0.25mg) and am waiting to start lithium. It worked great for a week but is wearing off in the afternoon and possibly giving me hand tremors. I noticed the tremors today and it has been slight enough where I'm not sure if it is real or I'm just paranoid. Going to my doctor Friday so I plan on bringing it up then. Another thing I noticed is my voices changed. I used to hear them when depressed but they were more like whispers and now they are less frequent but more clear and like to call my name a lot. 
  
Aside from medication woes I've found myself getting manic more often. I've been drinking beers (just one or two) in the afternoon to avoid the depression that follows my manic mornings. I haven't been able to talk to my counselor in 3 weeks because of all the snow my area is getting and I'm bottling things up a lot which is part of the problem. I've only told my best friend I'm bipolar and have been way too afraid to say anything to anyone else. Best part is I'm in the mental health rotation of my nursing classes and get to listen to everyone talk about people like me. 
   
 I guess I'm just trying to express some things I've haven't been talking about. There's been a lot to think and worry about. With this new diagnosis and school stress adding up I'm not doing as well as I could be.

There are other drugs involved, but this is the one my dad says makes her show the symptoms I'm about to describe. She has slurred, unorganized speech, delusions, paranoia, and she gets frustrated very easily when we have no idea what she's talking about. When I was growing up, it would lead to us coming to blows and huge yelling fights, which resulted in me repressing a lot of memories from my childhood-teenage years and memory problems. Now that I'm out of the house (20yo and at university) I don't see her as much, but I struggle with our phone conversations and my visits home. I love her so much and it's severely frustrating to me because she gets so upset when I have no idea what she is trying to tell me.

Please do not feel the need to read the short novel of ranting and raving that follows.


I want to start out by saying I'm actually doing pretty good right now. Got diagnosed about 2 years ago, went through a few months of finding the medication mix that works for me, managed to hold down a job for a year and have one successful semester of college under my belt, things are starting to look up again. I have my good and bad days, but thats just something I've learned to live with.

However, even after you get help and get your head on strait, the biggest part of getting better no one told me about is how much of an uphill battle, struggle and grind it is to piece your life back together. Before my disorder really came to fruition I was your standard good ol oklahoma boy. Starter on the football team, captain of the rugby team, 3 year first chair all state, member of a world champion DCI drum corps, good grades, 33 on the ACT..... it seemed like I had everything, my future looked amazing. Then the disorder hit, reaching full force half way through my freshmen year. Starts going downhill, failing out of classes over and over, going from a major university, jumping around to every JC and CC that would take me, until each one kicked me out for grades. Drove away the girl that loved me, quit music and sports. Drugs alchol and women everywhere. Most people who cared and tried to help eventually just had to give up.

Got the help I needed and thought things were looking up then it hit me hard, all the repercussions of all my actions, the realization of just how bad I had messed everything up over the past 4 to 5 years. I went from having the world at my fingertips to having nothing going for me at all. 99% of the time I have accepted things for what they are, put my head down and get to work to dig myself out of this hole and get to the light at the end of the tunnel, but sometimes I just want someone to understand, someone to sympathize with me. Because of having this disorder I am now 23, living at home with my mother, at a damn community college having to take hours upon hours of extra classes just to pad my GPA to get to the minimum to graduate, I can't even recive aid any more to pay for college due to taking to many hours already and poor grades. Most of my old friends are gone, even the ones that stuck around I can tell still think im ""crazy"" and walk on eggshells around me. The only job I can get is as a waiter. I get to deal with all this at an age watching everyone I know getting thier post undergrad jobs, buying houses, getting married, having kids. This disorder took all the potential and momentum I had going for me ripped it to shreds and threw it down the drain, and it makes me furious.

whew okay that felt really good to let out. I take ownership of my actions, feel generally happy, and am keeping on the grind to piece everything back together. However,Fighting that uphill battle to do that day in and day out can really take it out of you though, and sometimes I just need to bitch about it. My friends and family do thier best to understand, but they just can't relate. I don't need to to try and compare it to smoething you've been through to say you understand, I know ""life can be hard sometimes"", I just want someone to listen, some sympathy, maybe even a ""I know its hard on you, but you are doing great"". No this is not just one of my""moods"", it is me being genuinely frustrated at a situation that is totally ligtiamte to be frustrated about. 

Thank you all for having a wonderful place like this for people to come to for support, help, or just a place to vent. I really am doing great for the most part. no reason to worry about me. Today was just one of those days where it all boiled over, I got fed up, and just needed an outlet to let it all out and have a little 10 min pitty party before I go to bed so I feel better when I wake up in the morning and get back to life.

Sorry for the novel and anyone who took the time to read this horribly formatted, convoluted and redundant rant, but thank you for giving me a safe judgment free place to do it at.

I was fine finishing this, until I hit ctrl-r, and it reloaded the page and I had to start over. :( This covers a range of topics, I don't expect any advice, it just makes me feel better knowing people are reading this.


I was diagnosed bipolar last year and have been seeing a therapist every two weeks. I take abilify, lamictal, and zoloft (anxiety). It wasn't until a few years ago my depression picked back up and I started thinking of suicide. I'm pretty sure I've been biploar since at least 2002.


Since I've gotten sick a few weeks ago things have been going downhill for me. I've been getting more depressed. I work in help desk/system administration/whatever else needs doing and I really don't enjoy it any more. Last year I almost quit but my co-workers talked me out of it, now I'm thinking I should have quit and gotten it over with.


When I was a kid I loved animals, I was even in a zoo program where we got to take care of the small animals like goats. I don't know why I gave up on my love of animals and decided to take the stupid path of computers, but I did. I actually didn't even want to get into my current line of work, I wanted to program but I give up on everything that's the least bit difficult, so I dropped out of college a year in of a computer science major.


I also loved to write. When I was a little kid we only had a B&amp;W mac so I typed up stories on a typewriter we had. I don't know why I ever stopped, but I picked it up again a few years ago. Looking at the first drafts I was very imaginative, of course I gave up since it was difficult but tried starting again last year. I found it even more difficult, I had no imagination, I'm thinking it was the medication.


What really put me in a foul mood today was a dream I had. I'm a lonely man, 29 and never even held hands with a woman. In the dream I met a woman, it felt so good talking to another person, I was so happy, then I woke up. I was in such a bad mood, then a few hours later I decided to take a nap and I saw her friend sitting in a restaurant by herself. In the dream I was too scared to go up to her friend, I wish I had done so because it would have made me feel good, then I woke up again and it put me in a bad mood.


Right now I'm feeling okay, but the second my mind's not occupied I'll become depressed again, or when I step foot in the place where I work, not sure which just yet. I want to quit my job, but I have no other job lined up, and I don't want to work with computers any more. I live with my parents and have a lot of money saved up, but I don't know how long I can make it last without a job, or where I could even get a job. Maybe I would go back to college and get some kind of degree that involves working with animals. Maybe a part time job would open up at the local animal place and I could work there while getting the degree. I wouldn't want to be a vet, that's too much stress, I really don't know what I would do. If I was any good at it I would write stories and blast the Amazon self publishing store with them. I've got lots of ideas, but like I said I've lost my imagination so they wouldn't be any good, and nobody makes money on writing any way so it would not matter any more.


What I really wanted earlier was to not be alive any more. It's much easier than any other options I have, I don't have to worry about the future, moving out on my own, being alone, not being able to take care of myself, etc. People say problems are temporary but they've not been temporary for me, they just go away for a bit before coming back to say hello.",['attr'],0,neu_vader

Whenever she has an anxiety attack, her mum and dad will say things like ""but we thought you were getting better?"". Today after taking her to the hospital, they both agreed that ""she obviously isn't getting better, where have we come in the past 6 months"".

I understand you guys' policy on that sort of thing, and I definitely respect it. I'm not gonna turn down advice though. It's a bit of a long story, and I'm about to take a mondo nap, so the pacing is gonna be shit. Bear with me. 

I'm a 25 year old male working a swing shift in a laboratory. Just before my senior year of college, I was diagnosed with ADHD and given adderall, then vyvanse. It worked great... sort of. My grades skyrocketed, as did my marijuana usage. I dropped from 180 lb to 155 lb. I became really irritable when it wore off, and those moods threatened a relationship I really valued at the time. I did notice my first suicidal ideation i had in years a little after I started taking it, but i ignored it as a stray thought. Besides, I was in my advanced classes.

School ended, and I took a job at an industrial lab, swinging from early mornings to evenings every week. Fast forward to last year, when I began my application process for grad schools. I wanted accomodations for ADHD on the GRE, and I needed to be rediagnosed, because in three years and one month, it totally could've gone away. At the psych's office, i was given a series of tests and things to fill out dealing with personality. Before reviewing my results with me, he asked a few more questions, then laid it all out. The personality battery showed an incredibly high chance for bipolar, and the series of questions he asked were another diagnostic. Once again, highly probable. Also the adhd was still there hooray. He originally went with NOS, but moved it to BPII

Ever since then I've had a few dilemmas. Yes, my mood patterns do tend to swing from suicidal lows to productive sleepless spells, but am I mistaking the highs for normal adhd symptoms? Is it the adderall? I still feel the mood through the adderall, but it sort of heightens the energy of the high and sharpens the sadness of the lows. It's like being able to think in focus on the drug allows to properly see how sad I really am. Also, I go through phases of suicidal ideation where I want do die, or feel I should die. It's much like a car that is idling low. Sometimes it bottoms out, and it feels like it's going to shut off, but it picks back up and continues idling. Then one day I wake up and I'm done with feeling sad. I make a ton of plans, and I'm God's gift to mankind. This lasts for a bit until I feel the depression coming around and so on and so on. Sometimes I feel normal. 

This feels like the diagnosis fits, but fit my symptoms into this pattern had I not been told I have the disorder? Also, is a chronic lack of sleep and shifting sleep patterns manifesting these effects. I can't drop the adderall without killing my work productivity, and I can't drop the job until august. Also, I've tried talking to my P doc (not the same as the psych) but he doesn't listen to me and just gives me more adderall and benzo based sleep aids. I drop the benzos for weeks at a time to prevent dependence, because fuck that, they feel way too good when I'm on them for me to take them every night. 

I feel that to parse through the data that is my life would be a bitch. Also, I am maintaining a shaky balance right now that only needs to carry me a few more months. I'm worried that everything is out of control, and I'm at the mercy of my moods, my meds, and my spotty mental healthcare. I feel heightened and anxious right now, because I know that I'm riding a crest, and they always precede a trough.

I don't know what I'm asking, I just want someone to listen. My girlfriend is supportive, but i hate burdening her, which I already have. My mom was convinced I had been lied to, until I told her that I was considering hospitalization as an alternative to killing myself via traffic.   Until that point, she thought I wasn't depressed since she'd seen what depressed looked like and I tell you that you aren't it. She means well though. Anyways, advice? Comments? Commentary? Eh.

When he was 14-15, he tried to kill himself. That resulted in him being in therapy for a year (he quit going), and starting some meds. They really seemed to help. He had a great turn around, but still had moments of depression, though more of anxiety (which were expressed through short-temper and irritation).  Overall, it was a big improvement. Over the years, his doses were upped, and he continued to do well. This was around 10 years ago.

We've been together for 3 years  and I've seen a complete deterioration of his personality, sex drive, and general mood. He is easily distracted, easily upset, easily excited or angered---[this description of mixed bipolar matches him almost PERFECTLY](http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/mixed-bipolar-disorder). When he gets into those hyper moods of fast talking, he's very impulsive and his thinking is kind of fantastical (""That's it, I'm selling my car.I'll just walk to work."" ""I'm buying a truck."" ""Fuck it, I'll just quit."" ). And when he gets depressed, it's usually a very low low (""Nothing will help me."" ""I wouldn't be surprised if you left me because of this."" ""I should have killed myself years ago."" ) These ups and downs can happen hourly, or almost instantly. I've felt like I've had to constantly walk on eggshells and monitor everything to help steer him toward situations, or remove outside stimuli that might piss him off and send him into a rage. It's been extremely tiring.

 He recently admitted himself to the hospital for wanting to kill himself  again(so proud of him for this). When he was there, they were shocked at the meds he'd been taking. High doses of Prozac and Xanax, so high they could have given him seizures. They discharged him with a med change; nixxed the Xanax, and kept the Prozac, with the addition of Abilify and Klonopin. He says he feels a lot better. (I've been saying I think he needs a mood stabilizer for about a year now)

We also just found out that his grandmother was bipolar, and one of his parents may be, as well. (why nobody ever mentioned it, especially knowing what he's been through is beyond-fucking-me). He's surprised, but he feels relieved he knows where it came from now. Before, he felt like the odd one out, wondering where this illness came from if no genetics? The diagnosis fits , but they're hesitant to label him since SO many people are misdiagnosed as bipolar. So now he's out of the hospital, new meds, and seeing a therapist again. But we're not sure where to go from here. Does anyone have any helpful advice, or similar stories? ",['attr'],0,neu_vader

Thankfully it was pretty mild, leaning more towards a curious mash of apathy and anxiety (if that makes sense; I don't know any other way to phrase it) than despair. 

Last night was unexpectedly pretty hypo. I sat in the patient lounge and talked loudly and ebulliently about how I'd love to be allowed to go to the sort of parties and club nights that my parents always insist on escorting me at, about how I'd once tried to pierce my nipples but found a safety pin too blunt and it was probably a good thing because at 14 I had little to no access to sterilisation substances, about a rumour that another girl mentioned that P. cubensis has been found growing wild near Inversnecky, about the hazards of computer duster (when another girl started extolling the benefits of nitrous, I jumped in with my usual inhalants harm reduction spiel), about the tendency of small towns to have bizarre and irresponsible drug cultures, and proceeded to lose all dignity and control when I noticed that there were consecutive programmes about David Bowie and Lou Reed on TV. The other girls were hanging on my every word and throwing in their own anecdotes, as though I'd gotten them girlishly drunk on my hypo, until I proposed that we put on the Bowie programme. I was met with looks of mild astonishment that I should want to listen to ""old people's music"". However, I managed to talk them around to it - this involved jumping on a sofa and singing ""Heroes"", which I knew had been featured in a recentish film that I guessed that they'd have seen and liked, which went down very well, especially as the nurses started to come round and supply us with some zopiclone that, whilst having little effect on me, seemed to make the other girls rather tipsy - and soon I was belting out every track, prefacing each with a shrill yell of, ""ooh, I know this one, it's fantastic!"". Shame was not an issue. Shame did not exist for me. At one point, all three of the patients in the room were singing ""The Man Who Sold The World"" (""Nirvana covered this one, please, you have to know this one"") and the two nurses were leaving their faces in avuncular smiles whilst their minds ran away to thir youth. Eventually, however, my ebullience and odd behaviour (I seem to recall climbing up to the big sash window, noticing that the streetlights had turned the sky orange, and committing an unprovoked act of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds; later, I tried to sit on the old disused mantelpiece, fell off, and landed across another girl, whom I then tried to hit on) drove the other two girls away (at the time, I had thought that it was just the time - it was about 11pm - that had caused them to leave, but, when I think that neither gave me a goodnight or goodbye, I think it must certainly have been my hypomania).

So, we were left, two nurses and a hypomanic schizoaffective off mood stabilizers. What a fun night this was to be! The programme about Lou Reed came on at midnight. Normal hospital bedtime is midnight on Friday and Saturday and eleven on weeknights, but I convinced the nurses that I would go to bed straight after the programme, and not stay up to 6 or 7 or all night as I had done for a few days running before. 

The programme started. I spent much of it heckling one of the narrators, who kept misnaming songs (""They're Taking the Children Away"" being the example that I most clearly remember), and complaining that only a tiny snatch of the programme concerned what I consider the pinnacle of Reed's solo achievements, Metal Machine Music. At the very end, when the credits were rolling, funereal black, to the ""you're going to reap..."" part of Perfect Day, I cried. The nurses kept their distance until I'd calmed down, and I then retired to my room. I proceeded to pull out my maths catch-up homework and do it until, at 2, the nurses turned out all of the lights and confiscated my book lamp. ;~;

I put on White Light/White Heat (headphones - on antipsychotics, the line between mania and hypomania can be judged by things such as, will you listen to White Light/White Heat without headphones at 2am in a psychiatric institution?), managed not to sing (I spent the entirety of Lady Godiva's Operation scribbling in my poetry journal, because my diary had been filled up, about my confused views on transsexuality, and much of Sister Ray was spent - how can I put this - sitting up in bed and... headbanging - shudder!), and fell asleep somewhere in the extra tracks on my box set 45th anniversary version. That's how to end a night.

Today, I got up at 7. I ate some cashew nuts. This distressed and agitated me, so I went running to ask for my lorazepam early. The nurses said it was too early, so I flipped. ""Why are you doing this to me? Why are you leaving me to the excruciating knowledge of every little stage of the festering and warping of my bathetic body with the horrible, horrible, inexorable progression of my own awful consumption"", etc., etc. I went briefly back to bed, rose at 9, and hit the maths homework. And ate dried fruit with impunity. And collected my morning loraz. Then my father arrived, and lent me his iPad, on which I am imparting this missive.

Welcome back, upswings. Welcome back. May shame never blight me. May regret never taint me. There is never redemption; ergo, regret is redundant, an insidious illness of guilt and anxiety.

Some backstory: I'm 28 years old. I started showing symptoms of bipolar in fifth grade. I've been on hundreds of different medicine cocktails in my life. I started cutting in high school. I've been institutionalized three times, once for cutting, twice for suicide attempts. Despite all of this, I managed to graduate from college with a bachelors degree while holding two jobs. I've always done better when I'm really busy. My last hospitalization was shortly a few years after college. I had lost my job I really loved, my fiancé at the time left me, all of my friends were jumping ship because they didn't want to listen tome talk about how bad I was struggling. I fell into a pit that rehab couldn't pull me out of. It took me over 3 years to slowly claw my way back into the light. 

Just as I was getting back on my feet, I met my now fiancé. I told him about my bipolar and anxiety early on, and he said it would never scare him away. I worked my way up from a shit job and living with my parents, and now he and I live together and will be married in October. 

I started really struggling with my depression this past October, due mostly to my job. It was driving me back down into that pit. I had started cutting in the shower, telling him I had slipped. We talked for weeks about me leaving my job, and finally did the math. He said my health was more important than saving for the wedding and we could survive just fine for 2-3 months. 

At this point, I still haven't found a job, despite spending hours upon hours every day sending out resumes and filling out applications. I'm more than qualified, with enough experience at my age that these people should be fighting over me. But no. Every day that goes by without an offer I get a little more depressed, lose a little more hope. Not to mention spending more than 40 hours a week locked in this apartment by myself staring at a screen. I try hard to get up at a good time and clean or do something, but I end up snoozing until 3, and now my sleep schedule is all messed up, just like last time. So I'm typing this at 2 am while he's asleep. 

He's still working and he's keeping us barely above water, but at this point we're having to make some choices. The financial padding is gone, and there's not enough money to go around. I don't have insurance anymore, making my shrink visits and meds very expenxise. I'm on lithium right now and am supposed to get my blood levels checked,  it labs are even more expensive. He wants me to talk to a therapist because he thinks it'll help me, but we can't afford that, so I go once a month. You can't get much accomplished in one hour a month. So now I'm having to let my bills go unpaid and destroy my credit. We're having to make cuts to our perfect wedding.

All of this is putting an obscene amount of stress on our relationship. We worked through a rocky spot about a year ago,  but I'm scared this could break us. And after we fought so hard to fix things. And I don't want to lose him.

I'm sinking. Fast. With no way out. With everything going on, depression, meds, money, our engagement... I'm so scared that I'm going to end up right back where I was 3 years ago and loose everything I've fought tooth and nail for.

I've known him for a few months now.  We started out dating but that didn't work out well (I think he felt the depression coming on, but I can only assume).  I'm pretty sure that he was in a manic phase when we were getting together and I've slowly watched him ""change"".  We have remained in contact and have been spending a good amount of time together as friends.  He is honestly my best friend.  He is extremely depressed right now.  He is numb, yet aggitated.  I can only imagine how he feels having only suffered milder depression (in comparison).  He revealed to me that he has been having suicidal thoughts as of late.  I talked to him for a long time last night and asked as many questions as I could about how he feels and such, not holding back at all.  We talked a great deal about his past and family which hasn't been pleasant for him to say the least.  He told me that he told me more last night than he's ever told anybody before.

I guess what I'm looking for is how best to support him during this time.  He seems not to see his worth.  He's got a brilliant mind, is caring and pretty much amazing, but he is clouded by such negative thoughts (not harming people or anything, just that people are awful and he trusts no one because everybody screws him over).  I am at odds because he doesn't initiate contact with me but allows me to come over and spend time with him (but I always feel like I'm inviting myself, pushing myself in).  I never make him engage, I just am there and slowly engage if I feel like he can.  I guess I don't know if I am doing the right thing by doing this?  Everybody bails on him and he doesn't seem to have anybody.  I love him and want to be there for him but I don't want to push him even further into where he's going. 

What can I do that isn't going to overwhelm him or push him away? What kinds of things help but don't make you feel like a burden, like you're being treated like a child? I just want my friend to be ok and live a somewhat normal life.  He's done so much for others and the country and community and deserves to be treated well.

I met someone! We met about a year ago and only recently started dating. On our first date, very early one, she said: ""There is something I need to tell you. I had a big break down about 6 months ago and am Bipolar"" to this I LIT UP, smiled, and shared a little bit of my own history. Her eyes sparkled and it was a magical moment.

We are still hanging out and taking things slowly and it is very special to finally connect with someone who totally gets it. We can talk about that dark little empty feeling that sometimes creeps in, those days where I need to take a day off because ""I'm just off a little"", that feeling you get when family members are dismissive, assesive, assholes because ""they just don't understand"". It's WONDERFUL to be with another bipolarite!

Anyways, I just wanted to share a little story about this to give a little light and hope to those who might have lost a little hope in finding a strong, deep connection due to this disorder.

I put on a selection of my most valuable jewelry, inherited from classically stoic female relatives I know only from faded photos. I moved the diamonds in the light as I sat in the corner of the cozily crowded coffee shop.

I find small joy in watching the tiny worlds of dancing rainbows skip from the backs of my fingers. I'm sure I look like a child festooned in her mother's jewels, the finery juxtaposed strangely against my otherwise drab clothing. 

I had rings on 6 fingers; gold, white gold, platinum; sapphires, pearls, and diamonds. An ornate silver chain and pendant hung from my neck, falling gently in the hollow below my breasts.

I neglected earrings,  not because I didn't have them, but because putting them on required looking into a mirror. I didn't have the stomach to face myself in the mirror; I couldn't stand seeing such searing hatred reflected back at me. 

There is no amount of jewelry with which to adorn myself that can bestow value upon my person. My body feels pale and faded behind the ostentatious metals and stones.

What unhappy accident led someone as wretched as me into a life of worldly privilege? There are innumerable people who could have done so much good with the wealth and position I have squandered.  

I even despise my engagement in these exercises of self hatred. This endless loop in which I time and again find myself languishing has left me toxic. I am not just in a hole; I am the darkest earth passed through the guts of worms. Decaying waste that, unlike other fertile organic matter, causes life to wither at my touch. 

I haven't lost my light. I have consciously metamorphosed into a contagious darkness. My words have no greater meaning than the piercing whine of hot air slowly released from a child's balloon.

The main contributing factors were my excitement for graduating from a very challenging college and my dramatic weight loss (40 lbs in 4 months). I was given seroquel and lemictal but I no longer take them. Once I started getting regular sleep I felt normal and I just don't want to take meds from what I believe was a one time hypomanic state. I also thought that it was the meds that were making me feel slow/dull. So after graduating I never got the job I wanted. Was forced to move home and started working for my dad's company which is exactly what I didn't want to do. 

My issue is I don't feel like myself anymore. I feel stupid, I don't have any passion or excitement for anything anymore. I have a lack of energy and I look forward to sleep at night as an escape, as if when I wake up everything will be better. I used to be a very social person but now I find it very difficult to share small talk or just shoot the shit like I used to. I've lost my confidence. I know this sounds crazy but I almost feel dyslexic when I used to love to read. I was a fun person to be around before my episode now I just have nothing to talk about. Has anyone else ever felt this way? 

My excitement to grow up caused my mania and my realization that adulthood sucks is causing my depression.

I began college a few years ago at a state university but after a really rough hospitalization where I arrived by ambulance (9 days/nights), tons of medication switches, and overall extreme mood and depression problems, I left that school.

After taking some time off to get my shit together at home and find a good therapist (OH MY GOD IT TOOK FOREVER) I transferred my credits from the state university to my local and well respected community college. Next weekend, I will earn my associate of arts degree and I am SO Excited and proud. I've come so unbelievably far from the girl cutting herself in her old dorm room and drinking and smoking weed almost every day to cope.

Sure, it's not a bachelor's degree like I originally went to school for, but I don't care. I worked extremely hard and earned this degree and no one can ever take it away from me. 

WELL. My dad isn't as excited about this as I am. Hell, he doesn't seem excited at all. I'm walking in the graduation ceremony next weekend and he will be there, but every time I've tried to talk to him about how excited I am, he makes passive aggressive comments about how I am only earning an associate's degree and I should go back for my bachelor's soon. He could care less about the soon to be moment and is only focused on me getting more education down the road. I'm only 22 and he doesn't have mental health problems to deal with, so he has no idea what it's like to be in my shoes. 

Meanwhile, my younger sister (20 years old) is at a university and my dad couldn't be more proud of her. She earns Dean's List every semester and had a big internship this semester, as well as another one next summer. I'm happy for her, too, but my dad won't shut up about her achievements. I feel like he doesn't acknowledge anything I've done.

I work part time at a day care and will be working full time there this summer for the day camp, and they will recognize my associate's degree and give me a little raise (yay!). My dad rudely said ""will they acknowledge your associate's degree""? Fuck off- of course they will. I'm not trying to be a doctor or anything. I wish my dad could just be happy for me that I'm finally graduating and stop pressuring me. I honestly didn't even want to go back to school for the longest time, so this is a HUGE milestone for me. (Background info: my dad has a bachelor's degree from a very well respectable school and has a very successful career)

2 years ago at this time, I was at the mental hospital near my old school. I would have never thought I'd be graduating a college. Fuck anyone who doesn't think my associate's degree is good enough. It's a huge accomplishment.

Also, I am currently on 200 mg lamictal and have been for almost a year. The pdoc raised it to 300mg and it made everything so much worse (Extreme anxiety, crying spells), so he lowered it back to 200mg.

Diagnosed MDD at 14 after a suicide attempt. Prescribed Prozac. Nothing. Prescribed Paxil after a second attempt at 16. Zombie for 2 years. Went off meds at 18. Lost insurance, so even if I wanted them, I couldn't afford them. No insurance and no medication for 5 years. Cue innumerable sexploits, drug use, and generally reckless behavior. Went to college, did well, got a degree with honors. Three months after graduation another attempt after an adverse reaction to Celexa. Third time 1040'd into an in-patient psychiatric facility. Diagnosed bipolar 2.

Prozac, Paxil, Celexa, Ativan, Xanax, Effexor, Abilify, Wellbutrin, Lithium, Lamictal, Wellbutrin again, Restoril, Ambien. 12 drugs so far that I can remember, 8 of them in the past year.

Started therapy at 11. Quit a year later. Therapy at 14. Stopped going, because I didn't think it helped. Therapy from 16-18. Lost insurance for five years. Now therapy weekly. Still don't think it helps, but having an appointment every week gives me a sort of obligation to be here and go. It's a planned event. I don't know. It's stupid that the therapy doesn't help me, but the fact that I have to go does.

Currently on Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Restoril. They are not working. I still want to die. I have more or less lost faith in psychiatry or anything ever fixing me or even giving me a fighting chance.

I don't want to try any more drugs. They clearly do not work. Therapy is also not helping. Therapist suggested I may have 'treatment-resistant bipolar', which is not encouraging.

I want to change my habits. I want to write more, exercise, find a hobby (I have none. I can't muster the will to be consistent. This also makes me feel like shit, because I don't produce anything and anything I do produce is lightyears from being decent. It's like I've already waited too long to try. Everything I do will fail.), anything, but it is such a task to even get off the couch to feed my dog.

I miss my mania.

Any, ANY life advice would be helpful. I am at the end of the rope. I don't know what else I can do to make this better. I know other people must have felt like this before, and they must have overcome it, but I don't know how. Everything hurts.

 I’m curious about your initial diagnosis “adventure”.  

My own was long (started seeing therapists at 8, I will be 29 in March and was diagnosed BP2 in December 2012), disheartening, and littered with several other diagnoses/ineffective medication regiments/therapies (i.e. DBT) prior to reaching BP2.  I’ve heard that Bipolar is a “diagnosis of retrospect” and understand the discrepancy in when we actually seek out help, but… 

Recent circumstances (e.g. another bout of suffering symptoms that’s lasted at least 6 months now as well as a recent out-of-state move) warrant the approaching of yet another joyful trip through the whole “finding a psychiatrist to switch to” process.  The anticipation of having to “start over” is throwing my anxiety into overdrive which certainly isn’t helping the intensity of the other symptoms. 
 
Perhaps the most detrimental part, though, is that I’m losing faith that I’ll ever stop feeling/being this way, for a few reasons: negative experiences I’ve had with some mental health professionals, fear that there will once again be a diagnosis-change, the fact that it seems nothing tried thus far has worked for any significant period of time, and the voice in my head telling me that there’s nothing wrong with me except that I’m a spoiled, selfish, out-of-control toddler in an adult’s body.  The crying, the excessive irritability, the inability to handle *anything* more at this moment regardless of how small, and the reactive behavior when little things are added (my emotions are definitely wired like a light-switch, on or off with no in-between).  

Before this turns into my life story, I’m going to stop there and get on with the questions I’d like to ask.  I have no problem sharing, but this post is getting longer than I anticipated.  I really don’t intend to come off selfish, but if anyone is curious or thinks more info will help provide accurate advice/feedback I’m happy to discuss via comment or PM.  

For sake of convenience…

**TL;DR:**

-How old were you when you first sought guidance from a mental health professional?

-Why did you initially seek treatment?

-Were you ever misdiagnosed?  If so, how many times and with what?

-Have you switched psychiatrists in the past?  If so, how did you ensure the easiest transition?

-Do you also see a psychologist?  Is it helpful?

-Have you tried CBT?  Was it helpful?  The effectiveness of CBT for BP treatment seems highly disputed from what I’ve found.  DBT, IMHO, did not help.

-Does the nagging feeling of merely being a selfish, unappreciative, spoiled brat go away?  Is it just part of the acceptance process?  Or is it something that will likely always come and go during periods of depression?

-How do you deal with the guilt and self-loathing for impulsive, completely uncharacteristic, and hurtful acts/behaviors?  Especially when it directly hurt somebody you cared for?  

-Is there any way to “make up” for the stress I’ve caused loved ones because I can’t handle my emotions, am reclusive more often than not, take things out on them that they don’t deserve, and likely tend to create periods of high discomfort when randomly bursting into tears or getting pissed off without reason?

I was being treated for unipolar depression from ages 17 onward, and just had my diagnosis changed to Bipolar II this past May.  I'm 26 now.

My boyfriend knows about my diagnosis, and has been a huge help in dealing with the medication changes, changes in how I view my mental illness, etc.  He's wonderful and supportive and blah blah blah.  I live far away from my family, though, and I think he gets scared being my only ""bipolar support system"" outside of my psychiatrist and therapist.

After a bad night a few weeks ago, where I got intensely depressed and didn't immediately reach out to him, he has expressed that he would like me to tell my two roommates about my diagnosis.  I can see where he's coming from, as I'd then have more people aware of what's going on with me if I end up in an emergency situation.  However, I am not very close to my roommates - I mean, we're friends, but not on a crazy close level, if that makes sense - and I'm not sure I'm comfortable sharing my diagnosis.

As it says in the title, I have been doing very well lately, to the point where I might be thinking that I've really hit the sweet spot with my medicine concoction. However, I have mentioned in this subreddit a few times how my biggest triggers are having arguments with people. It also seems that I am destined to fall apart in the Spring and through the Summer, which has happened the past two years. I fear it may be happening again. 

My problem is, I have managed to eliminate many of my stressors. I dropped out of school, I work a full time job that takes very little effort. I've gone out of my way to improve my relationship with both my parents, and I've become much more social. Yet, there are still some things that never change. My stepfather being one of them. He simply aims to antagonize me, whether it be over something that actually deserves a fight or something very trivial.

I made the comment to my mother last week, ""I'm starting to get a little nervous. Nothing bad's happened in a while."" And I feel I may have opened Pandora's Box. My stepfather is an inescapable stressor, being that my mother will of course not get rid of him, and me still being too young and unstable to get my own place. There's is genuinely nothing I can do to avoid him, yet we butt heads over everything. 

Our argument has only happened about 30 minutes ago, but I can already tell it's different than it has been. I have this black-hole of contempt in my chest that I've managed to evade for so long now. I'm overreacting, but only because this is how it can start. And Spring has always been a very rough time for me. 

This is very choatically worried, and I apologize. I just feel like I need to get this down somewhere before I attempt to sleep through the next 24 hours or something to that affect.

The last two or three days I was on the verge of a hypomanic/mixed episode. My grand plans came back and I was well on my way to doing amazing things. I went for a run the past two days and I have not done that in months. 

This morning I seemed to switch and had a pretty bad depressive episode. I got in a huge fight with my dad and almost became physical. It's frustrating because he thinks I'm just being lazy with everything. I try to explain the severe nature of my illness but he just says ""oh yeah I'm sad too.""

I cant see my pdoc until dec so my parents were ready to drive me to the hospital because I was yelling and hysterical. But when they found out I was not suicidal (I don't want to kill myself but I sure don't want to go on this way.) they said there was nothing they could do. 

My pdoc thinks my BP may be medication induced and thus not my real problem. But the fact that I was ready to conquer the world the last 2 days and then couldn't get out of bed today tell me different. 

I keep telling her I think I need lamactal or something like it. The latuda is an anti-psychotic, and just as I suspected, doing very little. I know this is speculation but I've heard great things about it from people in a similar situation. 

Edit: I explained that they changed the dsm5 so that people with med-induced BP should be treated as BP not depressives. And she said ""well, thats up for debate."" I felt like shaking her by the head and going, I'm rapidly cycling and its getting worse every time you twat!

I'm so frustrated with the state of mental health care right now. I can only afford to see this one because shes the only one covered by our insurance.

I miss the ways I'd fall in love with women so quickly, and using my episodes to capture their hearts.

I had a paralyzing depressive episode a little while back. During it, I kept saying to myself, “It’s just my diagnosis rearing its ugly head,” and after I got out of it, I said, “I knew in time it would pass.” But as I became increasingly stable again, I began to wonder, “What if it wasn’t just time that healed the episode? What if it was my will power to fight it, to never give up, to understanding my shortcomings and face the challenge that it brings head on because I’m courageous?”

Sure, it did some damage to my academic and professional life. I dropped out of college that semester and  took 3 weeks off work (causing me to loose some momentum and status). I blamed it on the episode, with good reason. But, by clutching on to that theory, I was unable to recognize that even normal people have emotional struggles sometimes and everyone deserve a break every now and then. Just because I’m bi-polar, that doesn’t mean I’m different or flawed, it just means I have to fight a little harder than others, and I’m proud of myself that I fight. 

I’m not perfect, nor have I overcome my struggles. I’ll always be pushed and pulled between happiness and sadness. 

I’m writing this not to brag, nor to say that anyone reading this is doing something wrong. Living with this diagnosis and a tremendous undertaking. We all deserve credit for surviving through it. We all deserve credit for coming to this subreddit, interacting with each other in a raw, vulnerable and intimate way. 

But, we aren’t our diagnosis. We’re people. We’re human beings that experience life with a bit more color than others. We are strong people who deserve to give ourselves credit. 

Trying to separate my identity from my diagnosis has given me a new appreciation for who I am. My meds aren’t what keep me happy, my commitment to treatment is what is. That’s who I am, a fighter.

I’m not just bi-polar. I’m a person, and you are too. Don’t forget who you are. Don’t forget that you live in the real world with everyone else. And that’s because you’re strong. 

Bi-polar is merely an extention of me, not who I am. Nor is it who you are.

        I was diagnosed bipolar about 2 years ago. Not sure if bipolar 1 or 2 since it was never brought up and not sure how to know. Anyway for about the last 2 months I have been sleeping 10 to 12 hours a day and then drinking heavily before work. I work at a gas station and needless to say it blows. Having extreme social anxiety doesn't help. I tried SSI but was denied and have no choice but to keep this job that I feel is literally killing me slowly. I have to get drunk just to get myself to go. 
Today however I woke after little sleep ( maybe 6 hours at most ) and feel good. I'm still drinking vodka 10 minutes before I have to leave for work ( as I write this ) but feel better. Perhaps manic better but who knows. I have been off meds for a year now due to no insurance and things haven't been much better or worst. Not sure what I want from this post. Perhaps just to rant or get insight from others in similar situations. I don't know anyone with bipolar and my few friends are ad from supportive so this is all I got. So I guess my question is what should I do or what would you do in my shoes? Clearly getting smashed before and during work ( vodka and Gatorade ) isn't good but I don't know what else to do to maintain this everything is normal routine. Sorry for wall of text and format I only have Internet on my phone.

Thanks for reading. ",['npadvmod'],0,neu_vader

This seems to be one of the go-to, first-line treatment options for Bipolar disorder and it also seems to have some significant contradictions between what scientists say it does, and what users say it does (in direct relation to side effects).

From what I've read, numerous anecdotal reports of individuals taking Lamictal describe some degree of cognitive dysfunction (especially problems with short term memory). Unfortunately, this contradicts everything I could find in the scientific [literature](http://altcancerweb.com/bipolar/cognitive/cognitive-side-effects-anticonvulsants.pdf) [1](http://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3988/jcn.2008.4.3.99&amp;vmode=FULL) [2](http://altcancerweb.com/bipolar/lamictal/lamictal-improved-cognition-bipolarI-disorder-2004.pdf) [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11342682).

Does anyone have experience with this? Men and women. Has it gotten better or worse as you've aged? Has it really changed at all?

I'm 34 and wasn't officially diagnosed until I was in my mid twenties but I think, were I a kid/teen now, I would have been diagnosed much earlier. 

Certainly a factor could be the medications available, learning your triggers, etc. Life is often more stable as people age but I'd love to hear others' experiences.

Personally, I get seriously suicidal 1-3 times a year. What I consider to be mania happens generally once a year, year and a half. Generally, I'm on the higher side of depressed - not 'happy' but content enough while still being aware of the weight of my depression.

They'd switch alot. It's a matter of minutes for me; I can be happy one moment and immediately after something happens I'll stay depressed for days, if not weeks at times.
I've been very tired. Couldn't get myself to get dressed, brush my teeth,... My daily routine was just messed up. All I did today yet was eat candy and sleep, which is a rare thing for me as I am highly addicted to coffee :D 
As I've mentioned in the part above, I ate alot of candy, which is a part of my eating pattern that has changed in a bad way. I'm obese already, so Seroquel making me want to eat the entire world population in food isn't the best of help at the moment.

If anyone has tips on how to be less uncomfortable without the negativity comfort zone, please comment! I'd appreciate it alot.

The year started out with a massive suicidal depressive period. New psych, new meds...things got better. Then in late February my dad was diagnosed with Stage IV Esophageal cancer. I quit my job to take care of him, manage his doctors visits, meet with lawyers about his will, etc. He died 26 days after he was diagnosed. I was his medical Power of Attorney and had to make the decision to take him off of oxygen, IV fluids, and to only allow morphine. It was awful watching him die.

The next few months were very hard. I wasn't depressed, but I was grieving. My husband was supportive, things started to look up. We had a GREAT summer. I was definitely hypomanic....booking a solo trip to New Zealand, wayyy too much shopping on Amazon. I felt closer to my husband than ever. He went on a guys trip for 10 days at the end of July, and got back a week ago. We started to fight a bit. In the past, I've reacted REALLY badly to him traveling, as he likes to take extended trips (2 months on a motorcycle, for example)...and I have a ridiculous fear of abandonment. So some of those issues were coming up.

I start to feel the depression creeping back in....bad. Suicidal thoughts that I can't push out of my head. Planning where I will hang myself, what kind of knots to use, how to prevent my family from finding me. AND THEN, one morning as I'm telling my husband that I'm feeling really down he tells me that he wants a divorce. And that he has been thinking about it since January but my dad got sick so he was scared to tell me. The last 8 months of my marriage were a sham. His family and friends knew that he was wanting to leave. Everybody knew but me.

I can't afford the rent in the beautiful house we live in, so I have to move. I do have money to live on, but haven't worked since my dad got sick, so I don't have proof of income to get a new place &amp; my credit is shit. Rent is insane where I live. My 7yr old daughter(from 1st marriage) and I are going from a 3 bedroom house with a big shady yard and tire swing, to a 1 bedroom apartment. 

If it weren't for my daughter, I would have ended my life long ago. With these fucking ups and downs, life is just intolerable. I know my bipolar contributed to the end of both of my marriages, and I just feel dead inside.

Doctors are in total control of the hospital. Although they may not appear to be in charge at first glance- I saw one for 2-4 minutes every day at most- all responsibility for care and treatment falls to them. What meds you take, when you are allowed to be discharged, and even what type of crisis ward you are on.

Doctors review charts from the nurses and other staff members- all which are subjective disclosures of their perceptions of us- and it is in essence your relationship with the staff that drives your treatment. If you are pleasant, easy going, and [insert adjective about good pets here] then you are a ""Good Patient"" that will be given access to the resources of the facility.

If you are stubborn, ill-tempered, combative, or [insert adjective about bad pets here], then you will be restricted from resources of the facility. ""Bad Patients"" are to be avoided, controlled, or manipulated to make it easier on other Good Patients and the healing process of the floor.

If my disposition or temperament is that of a Bad Patient when I'm sick then I really am screwed. As we know in the BP community, we can't always control where our head goes.

**GLITCH ILLUMINATED**

*The doctor is the one in charge of your care, not me*, said the nurse.

*The nurses said you've been difficult, so we're going to go the difficult route with you*, said the doctor.

*Which ones, and what did they say?* asks the patient.

*Don't ask questions, that's not for you to know*, explained the doctor.

*I'm being violated*, said the patient.

*There must have been a reason for it*, said the family.

*Get over it, just stop venting me your sob story*, said the friends.

And the glitch continues unrestricted. 

At some point, you end up becoming treated and medicated for your disposition, as opposed to your disorder, and that's when things become really scary.

But if you tell someone you're being medicated for your personality, they will become offended or think you are crazy.

I just need help and dont know who or how to ask.

I always wanted to dissapear. I have made myself dissapear. I hate it. I hate this and no ones ever going to help me, last night I could have choaked on vomit, slipped and hit my head on the toilet, and no one would know. then they'd care....I dont want to die, I dont want to disappear, I want to appear. I want to know I am alive.
sidebar: I am also not fully convinced im even alive. I think i might be a ghost, which is why i cant text or phone out. Im waiting for the call, am i alive or have i passed?

I want to hear the footsteps down the path, turn over see /whoever/ look up and smile or cry and ask them for help....
Thats what I want. I want someone to tell me I am here. I just need the help of someone to help me.....

Why does no one care? am I that unloveable? that people would rather ignore me than know what's going on. If my brother goes missing for 4 days during a bender, my mom is calling every police station in a 30 km radius.

SOOOooo long story short
been 8 days, inadvertenly poisoned myself, havent talked to anyone who knows me, Im not convinced im alive, im ready to appear again, I just dont know how.......help me internet strangers....help please",['npadvmod'],0,neu_vader

I have been in and out of therapy for 16 years so it was a relief to get out of it. First of all, the therapist I had for several years, and I absolutely loved, she moved away. I really enjoyed our sessions and for the first time ever, I decided to be completely honest. I was so used to lying (because of being forced to go see docs throughout childhood and so on).  It was the best decision I ever made. 

She wasn't judgmental at all. She knew the right thing to say when I felt terrible and just seemed really wise and actually gave a shit. Oh, and she knew when I was avoiding stuff or maybe lying a little and had no problem on calling me out. So that was good. Yeah she was the best, and I was bummed that she moved on but I get it, shrinks have lives too. 

So I just found a replacement, some dude at some random private practice. Kind of a smart ass and even though I appreciate that trait in friends and so on, it's not what I need in a therapist. Plus he seemed to be pushing this EMDR thing that looked hokey to me, (AND it wasn't covered by my insurance so I said No to it.) it just seemed like he kept pushing it. I'll give him some credit, he helped me work through some PTSD and getting that out was important. But he mentioned after I told him where I worked that he knew someone I worked with, and even still hung out with them, that made me suuuuper uncomfortable. And then after the 2nd time he asked if the Carbamazepine made me feel ""stupid"" and EMDR could help with that, I canceled my next appointment and never went back.

I have a really good relationship with my pdoc, he's super smart and responsive but you know how it is, those sessions are short and it's all centered around side effects and medication management. I asked him for recommendations but that clinic is completely booked so he had a list of suggestions he'd been giving to people but no one that worked in the community health center, where I've had the best experiences. Seems like they actually give a shit there.

Anyway I guess w/o a therapist I feel much needier than usual. I talk too much, I mean, talking without thinking and saying things I shouldn't, flying off the handle, and complaining WAY too much about everything to my friends and boyfriend AND coworkers. I hate being that person that whines but I feel really stressed and angry a lot and I get so obsessed about whatever is in my head that I can't stop talking about it. I mean friends will listen but it's a fuckin drag to just have bitch sessions about things and then be like... whew.... got that off my chest. People do that to me and I just feel used, like... you just stressed me the fuck out complaining about your problems, at least buy me a coffee or something. But I've had so much work related stress to the point I am in tears every other day and my BF keeps hinting asking if I plan to find a new therapist.. I guess it's time to start that process again.

tl;dr:  After a year of avoiding therapy, I've accepted it's time to find a therapist again. Do you guys have any strategies when trying to find a therapist that doesn't suck?

All he's been doing lately is obsessing over his moods and medications and watching kung fu movies. He wants to see me every single day is the main problem. I get pulled into his vortex of horrible moods. He just wants to talk about being sick. I can't be his therapist anymore...

I wrote this essay partially because my doctor recommended I write about my experiences and partly because I feel frustrated and alone. It seems like there are so few people discussing Bipolar Disorder and so many discussing depression.

And I want to write about Bipolar Disorder because, in light of Robin William’s death, I feel like now is as good a time as any. His suicide has thrown depression into the limelight and incited many conversations in the media. Some of them are good, some of them are terrible to the point of obvious trolling (eat a dick, Matt Walsh), and some of them are just plain gut wrenching (nothing hurts like hearing the hero of your adolescence, Henry Rollins, say he cannot understand or respect you, even if he later apologizes). There’s just one problem, though; Robin Williams wasn’t Depressed with a capital D. He was bipolar. And no one is talking about it.

In some ways, I can understand. Bipolar hasn’t “earned its chair,” so to speak, due to the perception of it in popular culture. To most, bipolar is not quite Depression, because bipolar people can’t get really be Depressed, and it’s not Schizophrenia, because bipolar people can’t really experience psychosis. And despite how false those misconceptions are, most people still put bipolar into some strange, amorphous space of being just not quite valid. Because in the bigger pictures, we don’t want to call bipolar real. For most of us, saying you’re bipolar is just an attempt to give yourself an excuse to be an asshole and do asshole things.

Granted, the perception of bipolar had gotten better. Some celebs are opening up. Catherine Zeta Jones opened up years ago, and has been largely accepted as truly bipolar. Demi Lovato did an interview with Cosmo about her disease. Steven Fry has been and continues to be an advocate, though sadly most of his talks, like everything else said about Bipolar Disorder, focus strictly on the depressive side. And I also have to admit, we bring a lot of it on ourselves. We go off meds. We go off meds at an alarming rate. Because Bipolar Disorder, as the name implies, isn’t just about depression, it’s about mania. It’s the side no one wants to talk about, because it’s amazing and awful all at once. It’s addicting. You’re more creative. You’re charismatic. People like you. And you have energy, so much energy, you can do more, create more, see more. You’re your best self when you’re manic, and you don’t know how you lived without it. It becomes your normal, and it sits on your chest and eats your heart out and you never even know it.

And when it gets bad, when the depression hits (and it always hits; you have to pay the price), you know, if you just put your head down and grind it out, the good times will come again. And you never, ever admit you’re depressed. You don’t have a problem. You just need to eat better and drink less. Your shit’s just out of order, and if you can get it back in order, you’ll be your best self again. You don’t really hope your car swerves off the road into that tree. You just need more sleep. You don’t really want, more than anything in the world, to just get cancer and die slowly so that for once in your life your insides can be as sick as your mind feels. You’re totally fine; you just need to get yourself sorted out.

And then, sooner or later, it comes back, and you’re you again. Or the version of you you think is right.

Depression is what we want to talk about because it’s relatable. Most of us have felt depressed or know people that are depressed. We can understand and empathize with depressed people. Put bluntly, depression sells, and depression gets its fair share of media attention. It even has its own ribbon and de facto spokeswoman (Allie Brosh , whose two-part comic on depression paints a near-perfect picture of what depression feels like and should be mandatory reading for everyone). The most popular and one of the first major studio movies to truly portray bipolar as a disease, and not a sideshow or a bastard stepchild of depression, is of course “Silver Linings Playbook.” Except it doesn’t, really; it gives you “bipolar light,” with sexy, relatable characters and an apple pie and motherhood happy ending.

See, we can relate to Bradley Cooper. He’s handsome and charming and just the right amount of broken to make our hearts titter. And he is just so very relatable. Throwing “A Farewell to Arms” out your window at 3am is relatable. Hell, a perfectly sane person would probably react that way. Being irritable or angry or obsessed over an ex is relatable. It’s relatable because it’s not a true picture of Bipolar Disorder or mania. Mania isn’t throwing a book; mania is reading “A Farewell to Arms” and believing, in your heart of hearts, that you ARE Frederic and Hemmingway wrote that book about YOU and you HAVE to find Catherine RIGHT NOW and prevent her death so you go and you max out your credit card and you beg and borrow and steal to get to the Swiss mountains. And if you have to stop along the way to try and figure out the secret messages being sent to you through the songs on the radio, you’ll just have to adjust your timeline accordingly.

But that’s not all; there’s a darker side to mania, too. Not the delusions of grandeur, not the times you believe you’re the second coming of Jesus or you’re literally bulletproof. There’s the paranoia, the delusions of persecution, the insidious way that your mind turns in on itself again and again and again. The way you wake up feeling a constant sense of dread and fear and nausea, and you don’t know why, but it’s there and it won’t go away and there has to be a reason for it why won’t it stop what’s wrong with you why is it happening why why WHY. But you realize, there is a reason you feel this way, and it’s so simple, how did you not see it before. Some people are demons walking around in skin suites trying to destroy the world. And they’re out to kill you. Because they know you know. And they know you know they know. Every day is lived in a constant state of panic and fear for you life, you can’t eat because your food is poisoned, you can’t drive because your brakes have been cut, you can’t mow the lawn because there’s a bomb in your mower.

So that’s why I want to write about bipolar disorder. Not the sexy, dance-contest-winning parts of it, but the actual frustrating, painful, and often terrifying aspects of living with the disease every day “until you and your shitty brain both die,” to paraphrase Louis CK. The awkwardness of explaining to your daughter why daddy takes so many pills and the fear that she will have to one day, too. The frustration of telling your wife that the lack of physical intimacy in your marriage is because the only drugs that make you feel like a normal human being made you gain 40 pounds and loose the ability to orgasm. And most of all, the terror of true mania and the reasons why it’s still so hard to leave behind. Because there are precious few outlet talking about how I feel, and it’s mighty lonely.",['npadvmod'],0,neu_vader

I recently realized that what had been previously diagnosed as major depression and PTSD is actually bipolar - type two specifically. I definitely have hypomania at times. Usually it is severe agitation for no good reason, hypersexuality, racing thoughts, and talking super fast. But the main issue was mostly the depression. Recently, the aggravation issues are big for me too. 

I have not been officially diagnosed. But it seems really clear to me that this is what I have. My issue is finding help. My insurance really doesn't cover much. Only a few mental health programs are covered and they are completely overrun with people with addiction problems that are much worse than I am - so I continually get pushed back. 

My question is what you guys think would be worth my time. I have a psychiatric evaluation scheduled for mid-December. What they are planning to do is diagnose me then work with my primary care doctor as far as continuing medication from there. I really won't have further contact with the psychiatrist after that. Will it be enough to just work with my primary care doctor? Or should I look into purchasing a different insurance in January? 

Keep in mind the one I have is free and I'm on a student budget. The only reason I ask is because I have been getting worse recently and I just feel as though I have been tossed around for the past few months. But have most of you gotten better since being diagnosed and switched to mood stabilizers? Or are medication changes super common?

I usually have a bright disposition, can crack a joke like there's no tomorrow and I feel, for the most part as if I'm me. Lately, not so much. For those that don't know I've been through some pretty big life changes in the last few years. I'm about to let them out as I think now is the time.

In August of 2010 my marriage ended. It was a very bitter separation and a young child was/is involved. People who I thought I knew and trusted (my ex husband and my ex friend) betrayed me in the most hurtful ways possible.  

A bit of a back story, my good friend (no longer friends) split with her female partner of several years and asked if she could live with my then husband and I on our small acreage in a caravan. It seemed OK at the time. However, my ex and I had a lot of marital issues. Mostly surrounding his extreme work hours (he's a police officer) as well as his passive aggressive behaviour. I was also undiagnosed Bipolar at that time. 

To cut a long story short I exploded one day after my ex and my ex friend were spending what I believed was too much time together. That was the beginning of the end of my relationship. I accused my ex of having an affair with my ex friend (turns out it was emotional if not physical - I ended up getting proof of this before I left town). He gave me 72 hours to get out of the house or he'd have me removed on domestic violence charges (real or not). Being a police officer he knew the ins and outs of this. He said we'd talk but he'd packed a bag, picked our daughter up from school and disappeared. I went into meltdown and took an extra anti depressant (I was on Endep at the time and took 100mg instead of my usual 50mg at the time). I tell my ex friend this who gets me rushed to the ER and says I'm a suicide case and after hearing her talk with the crisis counsellor and try and get me committed on lies I realised how betrayed I really was.

Before leaving I was given some more time with our child.  I had to explain everything to her. I ended up breaking her heart and I feel so guilty. On my mother's insistence that I return to my hometown, I end up packing up what I could in a suitcase, grabbing 2 of the 3 cats that were mine (I left the 3rd one because of my daughter) and flew back. I couldn't take my daughter with me as he had already started processes for injunctions to stop me. It was hell.

In the coming months I sought treatment and was put on medication which I'm now still on though the dosage is somewhat reduced in comparison to what it was. When my child had her first visit with me I became concerned for her welfare with her father. My family was also concerned and we started the legal processes with regard to custody. The interim hearing had her stay with her father until trial. Between September 2010 and April of this year I have been doing the back and forth between lawyers and my ex as well as having to deal with a lot of anger and hostility from him as well as his lawyer. I have no idea how I've made it through.

I started working again about 8 months ago (part time) and have just been taking one day at a time to get myself back on my feet.  I think it's all getting to me right now as final submissions are due this week from his lawyer. Final submissions and response is due from my lawyer by the end of next week. 

The lead up to the most recent custody hearing brought out a lot of skeletons that I'm still trying to deal with. Finding out that my ex husband/friend were in a relationship less than 3 months after I was removed from the household. That this woman is now pregnant to him, that she gave him an ultimatum before I was removed that if my ex didn't remove me she would report me to family and children's services. My ex forged my signature on bank documents. He was caught at the last minute before refinancing the joint mortgage. He was convicted late last month with a count of Forgery and a count of Knowingly Utter a False Document which leaves his employment as a police officer up in the air (he's currently on paid suspension) as well as a number of other extremely hurtful things.

I've been having nightmares about it all. It's stressing me out and I feel like I'm just hanging on the edge. I keep going because of my child and that I know I can beat this. It's just so damn hard. I've been concentrating on going for horse rides and spending time with friends just to keep myself busy but it's always there at the back of my mind. What if I don't win this? I'm scared that I'll fail my daughter, that I'll fail with what I'm trying to do. I've not reacted, nor kicked, bit, screamed or shown any outbursts and it's taken all of my strength to hold it in. It's so damn hard. 

I know I'm not really asking for much advice, I just want to get it out because these last few days I've really been feeling it. Moreso than I usually do. I think it's because the climax is near and my anxiety is growing as each day looms closer. I know I've done all that I can do. I know my conscience is clear, I've not lied on any material or made any false claims and that I have to let the powers that be make the final decisions. I just wish it was over with already.

On a positive note I have been keeping up my counselling sessions. My mental health care nurse who is my main therapist (I see my psychiatrist only for medication tweaks) has told me that I need to be more gentle with myself but not to stop doing the things that bring me peace. I'm not feeling suicidal, I'm not feeling completely overwhelmed I just feel out of sorts.

My veins try to pull away

They’re afraid of all the bites

My mind is just gone some days

My eyes are sleepless through the nights

The echoes of my childhood

Still ring through my heartstrings

But I never, ever understood

The sadness that it brings

The melting air around me

Seems destined for my breath

It collapses, then breaks soothing

Siren calls to my death

The moon swells blood beneath my skin

A pitch black hurricane of cells

The reverberations of my sins

Mingle with the brimstone smell


The forked tongue of destiny

Lays curled around my head

I claw my eyes maniacally

While being swallowed by my bed

My teeth are grinding to a halt

Paranoia becomes my mistress

The way a wound embraces salt

The way lovers embrace madness

I can’t calculate the twisting thoughts

They lead my mind astray

This symphony of ropes made taut

Lets bleeding hearts decay

My fascination ending

Between the jagged teeth of life

Where dusk and darling morning

Drain to killers in the night


I hold my heart with purpose

And crush the fragile little charm

The devil’s grim, melodic kiss

Flows politely down my arm

I break the mirror’s rendition

Of a boy with sad, dead eyes

Exchange the room for ammunition

To inject the lows into the highs

Now falling, falling fast my legs

Begin to splinter into dust

The lipstick of the devil begs

My soul to readjust

The tiles pressed against my face

Barely any life remains

The reaper occupies my space

And pulls away my veins


Mania




The thunder thrashes my brain to mush

My madness breaks into a grin

I see the world, a lazy hush

And my entire mind begins to spin

I’m falling through the darkest soldiers

Carrying a torch that’s far too bright

The sun is on my very shoulders

And it streaks a brilliance through the night

That siren’s back, this time she’s screaming

For me to stay so far away

She splits apart my gentle dreaming

With vicious talons on display

The thoughts inside my head are sprinting

They’ve no intention of halting soon

The softest sound, a puzzle hinting

Leads me easily, for I tend to swoon


And this method lives inside the farce

It sings and leads me through the sights

I scream along, my voice grows hoarse

The wrongs, they melt into the rights

I’m smiling now, it’s growling faster

My gallant ideas on parade

I stretch them along the ceiling plaster

And cry “only heroes never fade!”

But this method, it lives quite dangerously

Tiptoeing between the traps and bites

When the sadness has no faith in me

It swan dives from the greatest heights

I’m swearing this, my heart is growing

It pumps the logic through my breath

Even now, it’s overflowing

But I’d truly love to drown to death


Her blisters break again, I’ve heard

She snakes her way up through my veins

But at this point, my vision’s blurred

A rabid dog fights with his chains

The medicine, it fights to slow my pace

But it takes far too long to work

Emotions crawl throughout my face

Until I finally go berserk

I’m laughing now, it’s bellowing

I’m shaking mountains to the floor

The meds, they set to mellowing

But I don’t want them to anymore

My heart’s now leaping, shrieking fast

The shift is now full in my soul

I spring right through the looking glass

And dive down the rabbit hole","['dep', 'conj']",0,neu_vader

I got to the point where my mom had to hide the knives and pills in my house and I felt really impulsive and dangerous like I would actually do something stupid. Ever since then, I've been crying over EVERYTHING. Like, any emotion I have, and I'll cry. It gets to the point quite often that I'm sobbing. Sometimes, I don't even know why. This has been going on ever since I've been struggling with mental illness over the years, however, but recently it's just gotten worse.

I was supposed to see my regular psychiatrist today for a follow up, but there was a snow storm today and I couldn't make it. He's going to be out of town, so I won't see him until February 4th :(

I'm seeing my at school therapist next week sometime, hope to go to a DBSA group next Wednesday, and hope to schedule a meeting with a psychologist.

I'm currently on Viibryd 40mg, Latuda 80mg, Depakote 750mg (started 3 weeks ago), Lamictal 150mg, Clonazepam .50mg, and Trazodone 150mg as needed for sleep.

The Depakote finally reached therapeutic levels in my blood in the hospital.  I don't know if it's working, or not working, or what.  I usually have freak outs where I'll get really irritable and anxious and agitated and scream and cry, but I haven't gotten like that since I've been out of the hospital.

In the hospital, the psychiatrist tried putting me on Zyprexa, but I had a really sedating reaction to it. I think it's because she started me on 5mg right away whereas before my regular doctor started my on 2.5mg at first and worked his way up, when I was on it before.  So, I stopped taking it. However, my regular pdoc told the hospital it was the most effective medicine I've ever been on.  Could it help with any of this?  Maybe the agitation?  I have no idea?  Maybe I should go back on it even though it made me gain 40 pounds

They also re-diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.

I'm just at my wit's end. I'm so tired of being so moody. It's like every day is an emotional roller coaster. I go from extremely happy, to extremely sad, and everywhere in between throughout the day. What is going on? :(  My emotions just feel all over the place.  I feel unstable and unsafe right now.

I don't get it.  It's not like I was the sickest person in the hospital, so I don't get why I still struggle so much.  I was ""with"" it and not psychotic.  They all said I was very intelligent, had a high IQ, and said I just beat myself up over everything and have negative self talk.  They said that I'm so bright that I need to stimulate my mind, otherwise it goes bad places.  They said I need to meet with a psychologist for CBT.  They gave me lists of coping techniques to use, but I've tried them lately, and just everything makes me cry.

Also, I think I'm going to get a tattoo on my clavicle/shoulder region that says ""there is always hope"" kind of as a positive affirmation to remind myself that things will get better, even in the darkest of times.

Anyway, this is all over the place.  I don't really know what I'm asking.  Just.. what can I do to get better and do any of you feel this way ever?",['attr'],0,neu_vader

The impulses of just running away without notice to anyone or hurting myself just because I can are always on my mind. I don’t actually want to do anything bad, I just get these overwhelming destructive thoughts and feelings. I could just stab myself right now, there is a fork less than 2 feet in front of me and I could shove it all the way in my arm just because. Not to hurt, not to feel things, just because I can. I don’t want to die, I don’t want to harm myself, I just want to do it because I can and I’m alive so why not? Crazy right? I know..

 This is why I can’t say anything to anyone. I could literally destroy everything in sight, break all the glass, smash the tv, watch the turtle tank just dissolve everywhere. And god it would feel SO good, for maybe a few mins. And then everything would go back to normal and I would be numb..

Right now I am on Lithium and it helps even out my mood swings a lot but that’s about it. And honestly idk what all medicine is supposed to do, is it supposed to fix all these crazy feelings and thoughts? Or just even me out and I have to deal with the rest? I don’t know if I can deal with the rest forever, I don’t know if I can deal with the constant bad thoughts and lack of sleep and weight loss and weight gain and hate and distance and  tears and FRUSTRATION. Does it get better? Can it get better? Where do I go from here? I’m too stubborn to give up and too weak to move forward, so I’m stuck. Great. I need answers but I don’t want to know the truth. Up then down then up up up and down down down and up and down and up and NUMB. I’m over it, I’m done. My relationship with my boyfriend is awful, it’s so broken, it’s hurting, it’s sad, its distant, and ITS ALL MY FAULT. 

I can’t open up emotionally cause I don’t even know what my emotions are or what they mean, I can’t get over my rape so sex isn’t even an option. The thought of it just repulses me, don’t lust me, don’t want me, don’t even look at me. And I get so angry at him when he does because why would anyone want to see me that way. I don’t want to be seen that way, I am not yours to have I’m not anyone’s ever. This body is mine to have, mine to fuck up, mine to close up. 

But why wouldn’t he want to be close to me? He loves me, he waits for me, he tries to understand, he holds me when I go psycho, he’s not scared of me, he needs me, he wants to be with me. And what do I do? Get mad, get so mad at him! Why couldn’t he just not love me, why couldn’t he just give up on me? It’s the better option for him, so I think. He says no, he says his life is better with me in it, he wants to be with me, start a family with me, grow old with me, love me unconditionally. And so I do my best to accept it even though I can’t wrap my head around it. 

And I lay there, numb, distant, feeling so alone and confused. How do I fix it? How to I right this? How do I give us everything we want? Most days I don’t think I can..

I'm currently taking 100 mg of Lamictal. I've taken it before, but this time around I'm experiencing *severe* back pain. Like an 8/10 pain. 

Back pain is listed as a side effect, and I'm prone to experiencing side effects more severely than most, but this seems excessive. I'm not sure if it can be attributed to the medication or if I have some sort of injury I didn't know about.

I also have a bad pain in my thumb, but that could be a fracture or related to a very old hockey injury.

Anyone else experience this pain? OTC pain killers don't help, and my student health center won't prescribe anything more powerful. I cannot afford copays, x rays, or more medication for another 2 weeks...heat patches only work for a short amount of time.

In August, CVS called to notify me that they could not refill my prescriptions (Lamictal 2.5 100mg once a day/ Prozac 20mg once a day/ Lautuda 40mg once a day) because I did not have any refills. I had a week earlier dropped off a fresh prescription. I called my doctor and he advised me to have them pull the paper prescription from their files and see that he had written out fresh refills. They pulled the paper prescription, and lo an behold, there it was. They apologized and refilled. 


Later that week, I noticed that my Lamictal only had 30 pills in the bottle instead of the 75. I called them and told them about this. They said ""if I was sure"" I could come down and they would give me the remaining 45 pills at no charge. I told them I was sure and went down and picked up the pills. They apologized for the inconvenience. That seemed so sketchy to me. They  had no record of dispensing only 30 pills. What if it was Xanax or Codine? What would have happened then?


Now here is where I get really pissed off. I have been having a bad month with depression and anxiety. Hard time getting out of bed, low motivation, pissed off all the time, dwelling on negativity, yada yada. Today I notice that my Latuda is TWENTY mg instead of FORTY mg! I have been taking HALF of my prescribed dose for nearly four weeks! No wonder I have had a shitty month. I WANT MY MONTH BACK. This is inexcusable. 


Another thing to think about... People rely on that pharmacy to stay ALIVE. They get their blood pressure medicine, their heart medicine, their cancer medicine, etc. Someone could have DIED.

I was in a manic phase.... But bot the euphoric everything is all rainbows an skittles. The kind where I got frustrated easily, hated the world, and started cutting. I am doing better now.

I should be happy right now but I'm not. I told my therapist I am in a blah state right now. Not stable but not at an extreme either. It makes zero sense but she said she understood. I have a sensory exercise I am suppose to try to help learn to control my thoughts better despite being ADHD. She said it should help with the racing thoughts some. Being ADHD and having racing thoughts is terrible sometimes.

Anyways.... Not sure where this is going. But I am doing okay. Coming down so probably why I am blah and hoping I didn't make a huge ass mistake with getting a dog and hoping not to lose my job.

* I haven't got the money ($300+ a week) to live by myself

* I need a job

* I need to be capable of holding a job

* I am terrified of coming up with excuses about why I'm not at uni and why I still live with my parents

I want to have a university education but:

* I'm terrified of people

* I don't know what I want to study

* Having to explain to people why I drive an hour to uni, because I live with my parents, who live forever away

I want to do almost anything but:

* I have no one to do things with e.g. camping for NYE

* I am terrified of seeing people I know, anywhere

I'm just so fucking over it.  How do people get through their lives like this?  I'm not even talking about imminent medication changes or hospital stays, I'm not even talking about wanting to move to another state, I'm not even talking about romantic relationships.

I know that I'm being particularly negative, but when the questions come, they are just so concrete and use such rigid logic that they don't go away.  There is no denying that some need to be answered.  I'm not in a place to make these decisions alone and no one can (will?) help, it has to be my own answers.

I just want to get through this stage of my life!

Before you can fully learn to cope with bipolar, you need to fully understand your condition. You need to know what things happen, as best that you can, so that you can then trigger your coping mechanisms to work for you. 

There is no 100 percent sure way of stopping these things from happening to you. But, there are countless things you can learn to do to help you to improve your outlook.  

To get to that point, we will start by giving you all of the information you need about your condition so that you can better understand what is happening to you. If you are a family member who just wants to help someone that has bipolar, then by all means, you too can learn all that you need to in order to deliver the help that you can give to them.

Bipolar is a condition in which there are extremes in moods and life experiences. There is no doubt that bipolar is a health condition that is serious and disabling to those that have it. It is a mental illness and it does require necessary treatment. 

You may have heard bipolar called Manic Depression or that a person suffering from it has a manic depressive condition. But, what scientists have come to learn is that manic style behavior is only one extreme of this condition. The other part of it is that of depression. Both of these conditions are vitally serious to your well being and even to your life span and must be treated.

While doctors do not have a cause for bipolar, they are working on finding one. Along with that, you can be sure that there are many scientists looking for a way to cure the condition. Yet, until that happens, we need to examine what we do know about bipolar and what it does to the person that you are.

For most people bipolar starts when they are just in their teens. Some believe that it is triggered by puberty. Others  
will not develop this condition until they are in their early adult years. Bipolar can last your life time, too. 

For most individuals, bipolar is a condition that doesn’t happen all of the time. You don’t go in and out of moods ore other experiences within seconds and you don’t do this all of the time either. For example, some people will have bouts that last for several weeks. Others will have them for a few months at a time. Although it is possible to have bipolar in which your symptoms flare all of the time, this is really the rare case. 

If you don’t get help for bipolar, your condition is likely to continue to worsen. There is no doubt that depression itself is a killer. Therefore, not getting help is simply not an option. But, the good news is that there are medications, treatments and therapies that can help to reduce the symptoms and help you to cope with your condition.

I will see her once or twice, then she is gone for months on end on medical leave. Then she is back, doesn't remember me, and then gone again. I am done. I am trying to get my illness under control, I need a doctor who is going to be there for me.

Well, the meds she had me on sent me into a deep deep depression to where I could not function. I spent ten days in the hospital, and gained 20lbs, and have been absolutely miserable.

 I decided to slowly stop them before going to see a new doctor. I don't want a new doctor trying to talk me into staying on these meds when they are effecting me like this. I am off of them now, except the klonopin I am still verrrry slowly weaning myself off of that. It's been a little rough, but I am no longer depressed and am functioning again. I am able to feel happy again. Things are better now then they were when I was in full treatment a few months back...but I am also aware that will not last forever and that I need a doctor.

Friday, I had an emotional break. A rough day. It happens at times to anyone who has a chronic illness. It's over now. I made it through. But now my mother in law is all worried and butting into my business. Lectured me yesterday about quitting my doctor and meds, then sat on my computer for an hour looking up information about mental illness and local doctors. I already told her I know all there is to know since I was diagnosed 8 years ago and already know which doctor I will be calling for an appointment this week, but she just ignores me and says ""Well, you never know what you might learn if you read this stuff online."" and continues to go on and on about finding a doctor on this town, or maybe this one, or this one....

Lady. I told you ten times already, I already know who I plan to go see. Please, leave me alone and mind your own business.....is what I wanted to say.

In reality I said ""Why don't you go spend some time with the kids instead of wasting your time on this?"" and walked away.

Does anyone else get annoyed by this? If I had any other illness, would I be getting the flack I'm getting for making my own choices on the type of care I want? My husband supports me all the way and would never let me get into crisis if he can help it. We discuss it often, and he is in agreement with me on what I am doing. I know she cares, but she acts like I'm going to go upstairs and kill myself at any moment or something. Get a grip. I've been living with this illness this long and been through much more difficult times than I am in now.

 So so tired of having people treat like an idiot or child when it comes to the illness *I* live with every day. Such stigma surrounding mental illness like I am a loose cannon about to lose my mind any second now. She also complains about me not calling her to come help me every week, because obviously my clean house, clean kids, perfectly budgeted finances, and happy family leads her to believe I am in desperate need of her help in order to get through life.

I don't know, maybe she's the one who needs help. Maybe I should make her a list of therapists and psychiatrists to go see. ",['conj'],0,neu_vader

I'm currently receiving no care and have no doctor/therapist I can call.

I've been dating my boyfriend for about 4 months now. He told me he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but he's not exactly sure which type. I'm familiar with the disorder, but I've never really experienced. It never manifested itself until last Sunday when he came over in a depressive episode. I had never seen him like that before. He mentioned he was scared because, around this time last year, he had tried to commit suicide and was hospitalized for it. The next day he woke up seeming to feel better.

Then on Monday, he seemed different. He was at my house while my best friend was confronting her boyfriend about lying to her, and he was fuming. He kept talking like he thought my friend was going to be attacked. Even after the guy left, he seemed paranoid and kept looking out the window. We were asking him to calm down and kept telling him to calm down, but he wouldn't listen.

Last night is what worried me the most. I arrived at my friend's house where my boyfriend was, and he immediately starts talking about his plan for his life. He explains how he was planning to go to Colorado for a week to practice a new ""healing"" business he wants to start with magnets, crystals, lotions, oils, etc. He is in the process of switching to a different store of the company that he works for, and he said he was going to tell them up front he was leaving for a week. He's going to sell his car to someone shortly, but didn't talk about buying another one that will work. He also keeps talking about working as a promoter and living off of a barter system. He also kept telling me how perfect I was and how I do things flawlessly.

I asked him if he was manic, and he said he was just very excited. My best friend was there with me, and she said he was acting very strange. My other friend even told him that he was making very rash decisions in such a short amount of time without a backup plan.

Two people who know him well agree that he is not acting normally. I'm not sure what to do. He hasn't seen a therapist or psychiatrist in a while, and I'm not sure that he is consistently taking whatever medicine was prescribed to him. Am I just overreacting? Should I not be worried? I'm not sure what to do or what to say to him. I was hoping some people here could share their thoughts.

Update: His behavior has become increasingly erratic. This morning, he was telling me how afraid he is that I'm going to Europe for a week the day after Christmas. He kept saying that someone could have drugs in their system that could get into my body through my pores when they touch me. He also kept saying how dangerous Europe is, and how naive I am about bad people. Even though I told him my father and brothers will be with me, he still thinks I'm going to be in danger. He kept saying if he could go with me, he could protect me. He also kept telling me he was afraid I was going to come back completely changed and break up with him. He then began explaining all of the connections we have, and how the Atlantic ocean will break those connections.

I could go on and on about the things he was saying and doing last night and this morning. I spoke with my mother, and she thinks I need to call 911. At this point, I'm seriously concerned that he might hurt himself when I'm gone. I'm worried he's going to have a psychotic break - he seems to losing touch with reality more and more. He's also acting much more paranoid lately. His mother and sister have even noticed his behavior, and agree he isn't well.

Thank you for all of your advice. It's going to be hard for me to have him admitted to a hospital, but I would much rather have him angry with me and be safe. Please keep him in your thoughts.",['nsubjpass'],0,neu_vader

SO... Of course, I'm bipolar, that's why I'm here, but I'm also an introvert, or rather I'm more towards the introverted side of the scale. I'm not socially awkward like people like to think introverts are. I'm quite confident, but a lot of time around people just overwhelms me. 

On a night out I usually drink a lot of beer, it's a way to get me to open up and actually talk to people. As I said, I don't normally have a problem talking to people, rather it's more the saying what I'm thinking thing. Alcohol brings that out of me.  I used to drink to excess when younger, thinking that was good. But now I'm older, I don't. I drink enough to open up and then steady myself to stay at that point.

Anyway, I've noticed a trend lately, I'm drinking for a while, having a good time, getting to a good point then BAMM I get this feeling ""I want to be home in my bed"" and then I'm tired and just want to leave.

I know I shouldn't drink much while on meds, buuuuut it's part of my lifestyle habits and it doesn't happen too often.

I'm frustrated with my pdoc because she let me down while I was trying to get disability insurance after she took me out of work; i had to get my pdoc at the hospital to do the physician forms for me instead. She also neglected to schedule an appointment with me and now because I'm angry with her I can't bring myself to call, so I'm 2 months behind on the B12 shots she gives me.

I'm really just having a hard time with my memory.

I can't justify my actions and feel like most everything I did was crazy. I also did a lot of molly and cocaine in October-December. I think I was trying to get the full blown mania back. I haven't told my doctors about my substance abuse other than alcohol. It has probably not helped with the memory loss but it was there before the drugs. All of the symptoms were. 

I feel like I have different personalities because I can only remember what I was thinking and all of what happened while I was manic when I am manic and same goes for the depression. Is this something you all can relate too?

I starting to think it may be Borderline Personality Disorder. But I don't have all the symptoms of it. I think maybe the Bipolar has led to Borderline because I have been forced to repress my mania. Or is it even possible to repress the mania? Does the fact that I have taught myself to do that mean I am not actually Bipolar but something else?

I wanted to pose a question: how prevalent have you found the BP diagnosis to be in your area/life?

Note: I live in a a decently large city (two-pro-sports-team-sized)

One of the hardest things that I face with my condition is support.  As the title states, I have never actually met anyone in real life who has been to a psychiatric hospital for instance, or even has BP.  NAMI is like non-existent in my city, and there is a general mental support group program, but I went to it a few times and everyone was like over 50 and had been recently diagnosed and it was like a how to get on SSI and retire early get together  

So aside from seeing my psych, I find it difficult that no one ""experientially-knows"" what it feels like to have BP. Thanks for being open on this forum.

Last year I was diagnosed with OCD/GAD and took two SSRIs which didn't work and made me feel dead inside.

About two months ago, I started the generic of buspar. An atypical anxiety medication that has substantially decreased my base level of anxiety, plus! No more OCD thoughts and tendencies. All seemed well.

In the time period of Oct. 1 (after stopping zoloft) to about Dec.15 ish I suffered from what felt like a major depression. Break started and I found myself happy to be out of school but I felt A LOT happier than normal. (Another note, I moved a year and half ago, and so I suffer from depression and home sickness a lot.) I found myself saying how much I loved the city I'm living in (I normally say how much I fucking hate it) and just generally being excited and super active all the time. Granted, during this whole time I use cannabis (everyday) and drink alcohol frequently.

Then after Christmas I felt bad. But not too bad. I wasn't depressed really.. but I wasn't happy either. I was just relaxed and a little down Christmas had passed.

I felt pretty normal for a while, until a few days ago. I seemed to come up again, except this time I was feeling very paranoid. A friend I hadn't talked to in ages spoke to me on facebook about a job opportunity. This kid is a good kid and I shouldn't have a reason to distrust him. But when he was talking to me I felt very anxious and I felt like he was trying to scam me and rip me off. I freaked out and told him I wasn't interested. Right afterwards I went and got pizza, and the whole time I felt bug eyed and I looked at everything suspiciously. Afterwards, I barely remember what I did the rest of the night. 

Finally, comes to yesterday and today. Yesterday I felt great all day! I was super positive and had tons of energy. I talked all day during class . I talked pretty quickly and made tons of jokes. I felt amazing and on top of the world. That night I smoked a ton cannabis with friends before going home. Then I smoked even more wiwth my brother later into that night well knowing I had to get up early the next morning.

This morning after no sleep I felt terrible physically. I was irritable, restless, and frustrated. I drank coffee, started stressing out, started freaking out and went into a rage (Note: this rrage is probably the most angry I've ever been about something extremely trivial) about a friend not texting me back the night before. I drove around cursing and hitting things in my car. I came back home and kicked shit over in my room before I started crying and being angry simultaneously. I went to a book store and calmed down, and now I feel pretty good again. What do you guys think?",['ROOT'],0,neu_vader

At least 4 times during this time, the person told me that they had in fact overdosed on their Lithium and other meds as well as alcohol.

I got very involved in this fight to try and save them from themselves, and very damn frustrated at the lack of help they seemed to be receiving in America. Over 100 messages flew back and forth between us, with them wanting to/ trying to die and me trying to help them see how they could live. It was heartbreaking and incredibly stressful for me. I cried long and hard for this person I had in fact never met. Especially those times when they said they had overdosed and then stopped communicating with me, stating they could not afford another hospital trip or ambulance ride.

Now, some of you are sitting there saying you were/ are doing an amazing thing. You have helped someone get through a really rough time. Good on you. You have it so damn hard yourself, but you did this anyway. Ok, I understand that. Thing is, the mental illness they have and I may also have on top of Bi Polar type one can make us incredibly skilled at emotional manipulation. After a traumatic childhood with serious abandonment issues/ abuse etc, this illness can make us seek attention in terrible ways. Self harm. Huge dependency way beyond normal on our partners and friends. I love you/ I hate you/ get out/ I will kill myself if you leave me. These are all too often said or screamed at loved ones. Usually in the very same conversation or argument

This leads me to where I am right now. How do I know this person wasn't just manipulating me? They certainly changed to a more hopeful tone of message after I told them I had overdosed because I couldn't cope anymore with not being able to help them and generally hating myself / seeing no way out of my condition(s). I spent 5 days in a psychiatric care facility , the first night on all kinds of monitoring because of what I took. ( essentially half my full weeks medication combination) I am still trying to scrub off the last of the tacky stuff from the heart monitor lead pads. ( 3M, you make awesome stuff but damn that glue...)

I have so many new appointments to keep. My partner wasn't able to work much so we had to hit up the charities for food for our family. So much damage wrought, so much potential for a far worse outcome. I was in and out of consciousness for two days. 

I am by no means a social worker, or someone at all qualified at suicide counselling. I should have directed this person to their local helplines and the suicide watch forums within reddit. I didn't and it nearly cost me my life and my kids a mother. 

Let this be a warning: look after number one first. Offer advice on matters you can speak to. Point people in the direction of proper assistance. Do not take on saving someone's life yourself. Do not necessarily believe that someone wouldn't troll you and take advantage of you, and fuck with you.

I am not by any means saying that I think that this is in fact what the person concerned was doing. However, I will never know for sure. They are just a nickname on a screen. No context and no contact in real life.

I will try to sum this all up quickly while still being thorough because I know a lot of people are really helpful here / might have experience with this!

I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 17 and all of a sudden EVERYTHING made so much sense. I remember in 4th grade my teacher told me I had a learning disability-- why she wouldn't tell this to my parents I don't understand.. Anyways, from 6th grade up until then school had been a real struggle, especially the focusing part. 

I was prescribed Vyvanse and all of a sudden I was able to remember everything I heard almost the first time around, and I could learn things so much more quickly. My grades were fantastic! They went from D's and C's to A's and B's! The only thing is I was getting very, very depressed. Like, suicidal. Each year I got worse and worse (grades declined too because I couldn't, you know, get out of bed) until my friend forced me to go to a new psychiatrist when I was 20.  I was then diagnosed by another psychiatrist with Bipolar type 2, and she took me off of Vyvanse because she said that it was causing rapid cycling. I had been abusing the Vyvanse at this point to try to counteract the depression, which I'm sure gave me symptoms that could have made me sound ""more bipolar"" than I was perhaps? 

I have been taking Wellbutrin SR and Lamictal for a while now and my happiness and mood stability have been for the most part solid, at least compared to before. I just transferred to a new college and I'm starting to realize that I can't retain most of what I am reading and it's starting to really scare me. 

I know people who have bipolar aren't supposed to take stimulants, but do you think there is a possible way to take them if other medications were adjusted to make sure bad things didn't happen? My psychiatrist doesn't believe I have ADD (which my friends and parents think is hilarious because I am the POSTER CHILD for ADD), she thinks I just have depression, but I don't agree at all..especially now that I don't feel depressed at all.  Also I'm wondering if admitting to her that I abused them in the past will keep anyone from ever prescribing them to me? I wouldn't abuse them now because I'm not sad.

I guess just let me know what you think.. I would really, really, really appreciate some insight because I don't know anybody who can relate and it's weighing pretty damn heavily on my mind right now.",['nsubjpass'],0,neu_vader

I always wanted to be a wife.  I wanted the idyllic white picket fence life.  Growing up in a divorced family, I made a promise with myself that I would find ""the one"" and we'd live happily ever after.  Seven years ago I did find the one.  We are so happy.  Everyday my husband shows me how much he loves me and I do everything within my power to reciprocate it.  He is so perfect for me and I am beyond content with our relationship, and I have every bit of faith that we will grow old together.  We have a two year old daughter who is the light of my life.  The love that fills our house is so beautiful and abundant and is such that it is the kind of love I wish for everyone.  My current status as a stay at home mother is a dream job.  I would not have it any other way.  Being the primary care giver for our child makes me feel like the luckiest woman in the world.  I get to spend my day with the most amazing little person and don't miss a second of ""real"" employment.  My life is exactly how I want it, how I pictured it, and is full of rewards I never thought possible.  As an Army wife, I know exactly what my fortunate circumstances are, and I thank the universe on a daily basis that I am afforded a life where I am able to contribute my creativity, nurturing nature, humor, intelligence, and love to our little world and the people in it.  I have a hardworking husband who appreciates my frugal living, and the life we have created together works beautifully for us.  Whatever attribute of myself I want to exercise on a particular day, every resource is available to me to do so.  As of now, my main priority and joy is centered upon my daughter.  She is nutritionally fed, entertained, educated, and loved.


*********
Somedays, this main priority of caring for my child, while ALWAYS fulfilled, takes an extraordinary amount of effort.  I often inexplicably wake up to what is called in our home a ""molasses day,"" as it feels like I am walking through a viscous and unrelenting substance.  It's a day where I feel physical pain from the struggle it is to get basic tasks done.  I have to sit in the shower, IF I shower.  I have an agonizing, sorrowful weight upon my chest and in my stomach that simply will not surrender.  The guilt of my daughter not having her whole Mommy is paralyzing.  The inability to just ""snap out of it"" is infuriating.  From deep within my inner monologue cries, ""I have things to do dammit!  I have plans!"" But on those unwelcome days, the black cloud always wins.  My baby needs me to be engaging but for some sick reason I simply cannot do it.

I'm fully aware and familiar with this despondence.  I can feel its presence before my eyes even open in the morning.  It has been happening for years, with my first memories of it in the fifth grade.   I have taken appropriate steps to try to battle it.  I have been prescribed a laundry list of antidepressants, talked to a myriad of therapists, changed my diet, adopted a regular and devoted exercise plan, and confide in my husband full disclosure of my good and bad days.  

I'm nearly 30 and I feel these episodes taking on a different aspect lately, perhaps within the past year.  When you are diagnosed and suffer from a mental disorder I believe you can become a vigilant expert in it.  I for one try to anticipate episodes, but as of late, the valleys of my depression are very deep, startling, and ever resonating as they follow or precede dizzying highs.  These bouts of what I have identified as hypomania are wonderful but astoundingly cheap.  While I enjoy these whirlwind moments or even days of productivity that yield a spotless house, a happily exhausted toddler, beautiful Pinterest inspired crafts or baked goods, or reorganized closets (to name a few activities, always performed in a bustling fury), I hear that little voice within reminding me and taunting me about how it won't last.  My husband comes home to a happy, chatty, warm and hospitable wife.  I am loving who I am in these moments, for I am the portrait of the perfect wife and mother, and a woman who can accomplish everything.  However, it's exhausting.  These days also often produce a debilitating shoulder pain that no trigger point injection or medication has been able to relieve.

These highs and lows have possessed me.  While I am fully aware that I shouldn't, I find myself retreating to different methods of self medicating.   I take my light dose of prescribed prozac in the mornings, but after that I survey the medicine cabinet for something I always justify as something ""to get through the day.""  When I'm feeling the valley I'll pop some diet pills or a Sudafed hoping for a boost of energy to snap me out of it.  When I'm feeling manic, I'll sneak a Gabapentin from my husband's prescribed bottle that he needs for joint pain.  It slows me down and focuses me.  It is so wrong and I know it.  Or, perhaps if it has been a day of flurrying about the house, cleaning and arranging until I'm out of breath I'll take a long ago prescribed Flexeril for the unbearable tightness in my back that I have caused from hours of activity.  It knocks me out and I sleep in a way I wish I could every night.  But no matter the day I always have a beer.  Or two.  Or three.  When five o'clock hits, I rationalize some excuse for my need to have a drink.  ""I feel down, it'll put me in a better mood,"" or, ""I've got to sit down, a beer will relax me.""   I drink enough to stop whatever maddening chatter has filled my head, or until I'm energized by the alcohol's warmth and false sense of inspiration.  I'm aware, I'm so very, very aware that none of this helps me.  I feel so out of control that often I feel as though I cannot help myself.  I just want a baseline, a norm.  I want to choose to be lazy on the couch, not forced to melt into it.  I want to sit relaxed with my child and build blocks and not be antagonized and tortured by the dirty dishes in the sink.  These peaks and valleys have dominated me and I'm so very tired of it. I'm tired of hiding it.  I'm tired of convincing myself on my good days that nothing is wrong.  I'm scared of what I'm doing for relief.

A doctor recently suggested that I, as a college educated woman, could be simply bored.  She suggested I ought to put my child in day care a couple times a week and take that time to go shopping or enjoy time at home by myself.  To me, that suggestion was insulting and insensitive.  I'm not bored.  I'm not whining.  Something is wrong.  Something is imbalanced.  I have the life I want but there is something in my chemical composition that has taken over me and has tainted the contented world I've created.  I'm at the end of my rope.  I finally sat down to get this all out.  Last night I did not sleep.  I was in my bed, with my eyes closed, but no rest actually came to me.  My mind raced, it inanely shifted from subject to subject, despite my best efforts to clear it all away.  It was a night of mania that crashed into a day of despair and surrender.  My maternal grandmother was diagnosed bipolar.  My paternal grandmother suffered psychotic breakdowns that resulted in hospitalizations.  Anxiety runs rampant on both sides of my family.  I think I need to recognize that I am genetically doomed and need profound help from someone who will take me seriously.

I called my husband and in true knight in shining armor fashion, he recognized my anguish and defeat, and is currently arranging an appointment with a psychiatrist.  I'm scared my appointment will be on a good day and I'll convince myself to not reveal these words.  I'm scared I'll be brushed off, diagnosed a bored and dramatic housewife.  

I wanted to share this, I don't know why.  But it's my stream of thought of what I think may be bipolar disorder.  Maybe it will help me, maybe it will help someone else. 

TLDR:  Long time depression sufferer, starting to recognize it might be something more.  Pending psychiatry appointment to discuss possible bipolar disorder.  ","['conj', 'compound']",0,neu_vader

I live in a household containing 2 fishtanks, Me, Symon the cat, and my Mother. I was diagnosed bipolar when I was 5 years old. (Many people in my family have these disorders) I also have ADD and ADHD, and a medication called Cerequil XR coated my innards in poisonous guck and made me weak and thin when I was 13. Since then I was diagnosed with a gastro intesinal issue called Ulcerative Colitus. I am also deathly allergic to peanuts and nearly died on an airplane going home. So, I require a special diet (which gets me bullied in the open). My mother always gives me a hard time for my mental instabilities. For example, when I watch a movie with a sad scene or story, I cry like I'm at a funeral. And when she fusses at me and tells me to stop it, I feel threatened by her loud voice and refuse to speak for fear of saying the wrong thing and getting grounded. When my mother grounds me, she takes my cellphone and computer privileges away. My cellphone and computer are my only reliable contact with my long-distance boyfriend, and, I hate to say this, but that is also a problem.

Only just last year, my classmates all graduated. They all wanted me to sign their yearbooks. But I thought ""why? why ask for me to sign it? You rarely respected me unless we were talking about music/cats/dogs/video games! Why now?"" and then I realized I said it out loud, so my teacher replied ""Because they're your friends!"" and they nodded. I felt nervous. I don't trust people very much. The skanky girls look up and down my clothes (black hoodie, baggy jeans, the same tennis shoes I've worn non-stop since 7th grade, earbuds jammed in my ears, geeky rectangle glasses, hair EVERYWHERE, and a blue hiking backpack), and the look in their eyes just makes me want to flip them off. I can't help that I'm different. I've only realized I AM different. My friends never stay frequent, I somehow associated with a possessive, crazy girl who lied the my best friend's guardian to have her kicked out of the house.

She doesn't understand- drawing is my hobby, and Brandon is my life, even though he's so far away, I'm waiting. ...this is getting off topic, but I'm pretty much spilling what I think into this.

Manic behavior. Risk taking. Self-destructive stuff. Drunk driving. Unprotected sex with strangers. Shopping binges. Temporary obsession with improving things in her life that she backs away from without follow through. Lack of understanding of her depressed decision making while not depressed, e.g. ""why do I do this?"" etc.. Self-medication with alcohol, sex, beer, and pot. Deep depression leading to talk of suicide. Lack of self worth.
We rarely fight if ever. I've never been anything but kind and loving to her throughout the difficulty of all this, and the BP-type stuff pre-dates our relationship by some time.

To clarify, this is not diagnosed, and she has never been to a therapist or psychiatrist. She has significant trauma in her family life. Father was absent until recently, mother died young, stepfather was a creep and an asshole.

The depressive episodes almost always coincide with her alienating herself from me and others, if not cutting off contact completely or saying that we're ""over."" She returns within a week or two generally, initially with reach-out contact like a simple ""Hi"" in a text, and we get back to happy and have a really great time together when things work out. She doesn't seem to understand why she cut me off in the first place, sometimes.

Most recently, in what appears to be a major depressive spiral, she stopped taking care of herself, claiming she's ""ugly"" so why bother. She started smoking cigarettes again, having quit a year ago because lung cancer killed her mother a few years back. She was offered a new job, about which she was manic and overjoyed because she's hated her current job for a long time, but decided not to quit smoking pot to prepare for a drug test, or even go to the interview.

I've made it very apparent in person and via emails that I'm here for her, that I love her dearly, and that I really badly want her to get help for herself. I kindly nudged her toward this at first, then more sternly and directly after the last incident because I felt a bit used and emotionally compromised by it and she'd left me high and dry again. I provided her with information on a free/low-cost place in town to go and talk to someone and get some treatment that comes highly recommended by a good friend and my own therapist. Her past pattern is to avoid this confrontation or admission of a problem, pushing people away from her if necessary in order to do that. She'll then surround herself with new people who aren't aware of her issues and start the cycle all over again.

Have I done all I can? I love her so much and want her to get this under control so that she can move forward to a healthier place. With me if it's possible. As I'm sure is common and familiar, her ""up"" days are amazing. She's irresistible. I'm just worried about her long-term well being at this point.

TL;DR
An undiagnosed person with BP symptoms refuses to address her problems and get help. I love her and have done what I can. What now?

Hey all, been a tough month for me. High stress from work being short people and working tons of extra hours on low sleep, to a performance starting up requiring extra practices, to costuming work piling up, to stress about little every day annoyances almost triggering rage. **deep breath**

I've been bipolar before the term was accepted. My counselors as a child labeled me just about everything under the sun in the mid/late 80's. Different meds different therapies. But the problem wasn't wholly the disorder.  My mother divorced my father when I was 1. He's severely bipolar and has let it control him all his life. 

My father for the most part appears to be a nice man. He's incredibly smart, with the ego that leads towards feelings of entitlement. He never wanted to raise me. But since I was taken from him by my mother, if he couldn't have me, he would ruin our lives by controlling me.

He started very young on our visits. Spoiling me while playing the ""your poor dad"" card. It was a slow building manipulation of my young mind. Little steps of undermining all the rules my mother was trying to set out for me. 

As a bipolar kid to a single mother trying to finish college I was a terror on my own. I'm a rapid cyclist who at times in my life has swung the full spectrum in no time flat to transition. Add to that a father feeding you information on how to undermine the authority figures around you and the mixture is volatile. 

I was lucky to have an authoritative step father after a few years. My mother was lucky to find a man who endured what I put him through.  (We get along great now) My father convinced me his hard nosed tactics to get my absurd behavior under control were abusive, Psychologically abusive.  It was 7 when I first told a therapist I was being abused at home at my fathers behest. Following that was calls to crisis centers, cops, any number my father could feed me along with the story I should have.

By 8 I was the one threatening my step father if I didn't get my way. No child should have that power. To his credit he never stopped fighting every allegation I wrongly brought against him. And his hard nosed tactics actually sank in later in life allowing me to be a productive member of society.

Skip forward a few years. My father has me convinced that at 10 I can come live with him and my step mom. I force the issue, my mother is willing to give it a try.

She retains custody as I move up on a trial basis. My father is not prepared for the monster he has created.

First couple months go by like a visitation, my father proudly parades me around like a victory trophy, but his interest in anything but himself always fades. Luckily my step mother was authoritative (towards us both, I am still amazed at her for keeping my father in line and functional for as long as she did). I become more of a bother to him. My outbursts and mood would trigger his temper and mood swings and the house would go to hell. He couldn't deal with a hellion who would threaten authority. School was worse... with no friend base my new school turned into my private hell after the first time they saw me cry. Taunted to the point of fleeing my tormentors one day I ran out unto a overhang from a second story. Despite never getting close to the edge, despite never once acting the part... I was labeled high risk and suicidal. From here my life became hell.

My father acted quickly and enrolled me in a psychiatric(?) hospital for juvinals. I was 11, and my father did not have custody. It should not have been allowed, he did not have the authority to do so. My mother frantically drove 9 hours to try to fix the issue the second she learned what happened. (It was delayed) but the state had its claws in me, illegally initiated... but thats a minor oversight.

I was in hospitals and treatment centers for the next 5 years of my life. Have you ever been told you are something do much that you finally believe it? Within the first year of daily therapy sessions they had convinced me of being suicidal. Or maybe I became that. The early 90's mental hospitals at times resembled a Pavlovian scientific experiment at times.  Something would happen, and if you were ""good"" you would be rewarded. If you were bad you became a second class citizen. And the ""wardens"" would sometimes poke you until you reacted in a way to further your incarceration. I've been strapped to a table and left overnight ""for my safety"" a few times... I defecated a few hours in. 12 hours later a nurse found me in the morning. Soundproofing ment no one on the new shift knew I was there.

My mother never stopped fighting to get me back. But the years of my fathers mental poisoning had me weaving stories to my therapists that roadblocked any chance at a normal home for me. At this point I was a habitual liar. I knew what I had to say in the system to work the therapists to what I wanted. You see once I was out of the hospitals... the treatment centers were like summer camp. They seamed to think high rewards like horses, fishing, videogames, movie nights, toys, were a path for children to maintain good behavior. But threatened with taking that away because I had become stable, I would revolt. Every time my mother almost had me cleared to go home I would stage an episode of epic proportions. That would lead to temporary incarceration. But privallages were easily earned back. 

Eventually I was passed into the foster family setup after the centers determined they could do no more for me. My mother couldn't get me home, but she at least kept getting me closer. She would visit every other week. 16 hour trips with 2 kids at home, full time job. My father visited me once in those 4 years... to show off his armor and show how awesome he was to the kids/center. Despite my plea's... Something always came up. 

Skip ahead abit (aside from one abusive foster home, and having dodged a kid attempts at killing me a few times) foster homes were good for me... I settled abit.  The doctors finally stopped swapping my medication (with my extreme swings medication that would work for a few months sometimes lead to destabilizing me and sending me off the deep end the next swing, this lead to each new doctor prescribing his preferred cocktail and chaos ensuing. There were alot less choices back then. )

At this point I was a full fledged ward of the state. The damage I did to my mothers household reputation via exerting what control I had... had taken its toll. The price for getting me close to home was giving up control of her son. 

Luckily I ended up with my grandparents as I started highschool. Luckily I found 1 friend dispite being an initial asshole.

Treatment centers teach you about you... I was socially inept entering highschool. I hadn't experienced normal social interaction in 4 years. It was ""ok to cry"", ""ok to be angry and express yourself"". Otherwise known as social suicide in the MTV generation of high schoolers. 

I found drama, early web development, video production... I finally had outlets to the surging creativity and made friends in those classes. I had support... and started thinking of the world differently. 

Its the reason I'm here today. I came close early on to suicide. Made a promise with myself. ""You can always kill yourself tomorrow. Might as well see how its going to be..."" 

Normal (maybe too strong a word for drama kids) friends gave me hope... and for the first time in my life I cared about others more then myself. 

It took 8 years from that point to unravel the psychological damage my father wrought. It was a hard road as I can't go to therapy. (I associate some trama with it, and my ego refuses to admit that it would likely be helpfull outside of sessions with my father)

When I started Caring about people I started worrying about hurting them. As a high schooler I mapped my cycles. (Standard is 5-6 swings a year for periods usually lasting around 2 months with periods of extreme fluctuations signaling a shift occasionally) I also went off my meds my senior year. My family never noticed.

I become obsessed with how my mind worked. I sectioned off a part of my thought process to examine feelings as they occurred and noticed something. Every time I felt like I was becoming a passenger on an outburst, doomed to watch a rollercoaster or emotional tragedy of whatever flavor the bipolar was forcing from the depths of my mind... they were all my thoughts... but they were being warped by my current state. Anxiety plus mania would end up pulling me into a seemingly never ending downward spiral as sure as depression and loneliness would. My own self doubt was my biggest enemy. To cope initially upon this self discovery I developed facades. I took my acting to heart and tucked away emotion under a mask. I was finally normal to others. Some of the anger tools I scoffed at as a child helped. Feeling normal, appearing normal, enabled me to establish a base of supporting friends.

I delved into my mind so much it impeded my schoolwork in college. The only classes interesting to me were psychology and sociology. I left a nice university grant because I couldn't focus on school and myself. Controlling my mood had become my priority. 

I began to filter every thought that came forward. Analyzing if it had been twisted by my state of mind before allowing myself to express it. Some nights I wondered if I would someday fall into full blown schizophrenia. I developed a routine of meditation and self awareness and no one knew that I was anything but normal. 

I made myself as employable as possible. Examined job career paths that use resume building to fulfill job requirements over university experience. I found that hard labor helped expend the negative energy. I had found balance.

My best friend... upon talking to him about it one night said something profound. 

""So its not as if you feel differently... its that you feel more than the rest of us""

I've wondered how true that might be. Bipolar individuals have a tendency to tread down the path self delusion. Recently I had a psychiatric evaluation that ended with an inconclusive 'pass'. The man told me that I said all the wrong things, admitting my feelings. Being truthful about my events. He told me the way I discribed how I handled my bipolar was ludicrous, and that he had encountered nothing like it... but at the same time... I had admitted everything to him in a manner that was forthright. I had maintained a stable job for over 9 years with no disruption. My social setup was healthy. He could find no reason I was unfit for work. (Side note I've always been upfront about bipolar on applications. One job tried to have me fired after hearing me talk about it one day only to learn they hired me with it listed. But enough about social prejudice against us)

He told me either I was truly delusional to the point of being borderline insane. Or lying about being bipolar. 

I don't know how I feel about that... but I'm currently processing my thoughts on the manner.

And now that I've typed this from a relaxing bath... my phone is dying. 

Thank you for whoever takes the time to read this rambling... I don't advocate anything I've done for myself for others.

Today I just needed to talk. To type... to let the mania run its course and let the stress out. I would love to share more later. You are the first 'group' I've shared with.

I spent five days in the hospital out of touch with reality. I thought I was speaking to God directly and that I had figured out His game. He was giving and docking points for my thoughts and actions at this point in time. Because I was such a bad person, I was to become a priest. Only I knew the real Pope and I would study under him to save the world. Since I wasn’t perfect, I would go to hell and be eternally separated from God. I thought all of these were real events happening in my life, that it was my calling. In reality, my own brain had turned against me. I was literally torturing myself.

Rewind. In a type of chicken or egg game, I got into drugs in college: marijuana, amphetamines, and cocaine, in that order. The highs were incredible. I was everybody’s best friend, going out any day of the week. A bottle of vodka, a sixer, and some pills: hello, Monday. My sex drive was “blowjobs in Chilean bathrooms” high. Then people wouldn’t see me for five days, as I was in a completely darkened room, only venturing out for food and liquor. 

I did have an experience that changed my life for the better through all of this. I ended up smoking so much pot, time began repeating itself and I thought I could never escape. Eventually the voices in my head told me to go to sleep and that I was dead. My parents would be there to pick up my body in the morning. Lo and behold, I woke up. Going from believing you’re dead to actually being alive is quite a trip. I was so fucking scared and overwhelmed with every emotion ever. But boom, I knew I needed help. Thank God for that.

I would need some more three years later. Even though I started on Lamictal, Zyprexa, and Trilafon, I kept drinking. In my non-medical opinion, alcohol numbed my extreme emotions, which was serious relief in the moment. The depressions became worse though and eventually I couldn’t manage my own life. By last summer, I knew I was also an alcoholic.

Since quitting drinking, I’ve made a medicine switch. I’m still on Lamictal, but Zyprexa and Trilafon  had run their course. My brain fog was extreme. Essentially, I felt drugged all the time. I started on Abilify with great success for clarity. I haven’t felt that way in a very long time.

Without the alcohol, I’m feeling all these raw emotions, bipolar style. Cycling, anxiety, paranoia, inspiration, sadness, confusion. I could go on forever. Questions without answers abound. I wonder why normal people don’t think about these things. 

I have a healthy appetite for self-destruction. I also have a strong inclination for self-improvement. I sincerely want to be better. I want to enjoy life. Most of the time, I don’t know how to do that. Right now, my spectrum is full of shit, interspersed by moments of something approaching happiness. Maybe one day that flips.

Then I flipped out on Day 5 and had first ever panic attack and weird agoraphobia reaction. The psych says she's had a few bipolar patients respond poorly to that particular med.


Now I just started my 2nd ever psych med Lamictal on the lowest titrate dose (12.5mg p/d first week) as am pretty sensitive to both class A's and pharms! Now something has changed in my mind by Day 3. It's kinda like a little slice of the warm feeling I got inside when I had Tramadol. From my Dr Googling, have read that this particular opioid is known to have some antidepressant qualities - I wonder if this is maybe Lamictal's antidepressant qualities I can feel? 


Have also gone to sleep without needing to smoke any weed or have a glass of red right before bed, as I've done for the last decade or so! This was only able to happen if I took 2 Tramadol about an hour or 2 before bed.




Now people (pysch doc included) would say this dose of Lamictal is far too small to have any such effect already, like I'm experiencing. Has anyone else experienced any immediate improvement mood and on such small dose? I've been doing some more Dr Googling on Lamotrigine and its effects in small doses. Most people seem to sit between 100-300 for bipolar. Is there anyone out there on a small dose like 25-50mg and staying stabilised at that level? Or do the effects wear off and that's why you're at 100mg?



I feel like if I get the wretched rash now, will be so devastated not only because my skin is falling off and am disfigured, but also because this med's given me a glimmer of hope this week that I haven't had since I ran out of Tramadol.

Nearing the end of the period I began getting really jumpy about doors slamming and I started doing things like laughing out loudly in the middle of church because I couldn't help it(at this point I'd told my friends that I was a high-functioning alcoholic in order to explain weird things like that) and I decided to drag myself to the doctor while reeking of alcohol where the attending nurses initially thought I had ebola(I showed them my passport showing I hadn't left the country), then that I was on drugs. I ended up seeing the doctor where I literally described myself as feeling like I'd taken a shitton of cocaine and she ended up prescribing me 25mg of Seroquel which helped me get a solid 14 hours of sleep. I also started re-taking my Fluoextine at this point.

I then seemed to shift back to depression and ended up checking myself into a mental hospital for observation where I got switched onto 150mg of Venlafaxine, 15mg of Mirtazapine and 50mg of Seroquel. I'd looked up my symptoms during the one and a half week which seemed to correspond to a bipolar hypomanic episode and I asked my doctor if I could be bipolar but he said I was just depressed but they would keep me under observation. I got released later on.

**TL;DR**
Obviously I myself think I'm bipolar because I've been posting on here for a while but I also don't want to discount my doctor's diagnsosis. The meds I'm on currently have helped me with my depression, appetite and sleeping but I feel like my depression is about 50% down even though I should be about 100%-ish at this stage of my treatment since I've been avoiding alcohol. 

I was curious if

a) The ""hypomanic episode"" could be caused by fluoxetine withdrawal(about three weeks period between pills)? Of note is the fact that I was drinking heavily and also taking a lot of energy drinks and had an extremely shitty sleep schedule with low amount of sleep during my one month of taking in fluoxetine

b) Could the ""hypomanic episode"" be caused by the short-term Valium abuse?

c) I feel like my depression has gone down from severe to moderate with my current meds but I still have problems with motivation, memory and concentration. However I don't have problems with feelings of hopelesness and worthlessness.  If I was bipolar 2, would switching to proper bipolar meds like lithium and latmotrigine help in fully kicking out my depression?  

d) Would firmly requesting my doctor to see if we can experiment by stopping my Seroquel intake and seeing if my Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine push me into a hypomanic episode be a valid way of confirming if I'm actually bipolar 2?

I've shared my thoughts with my doctor but he said we should stick with the depression diagnosis and current meds for now.",['conj'],0,neu_vader

I have been having weird issues with conversations lately. I don't know if it could be related to my bipolar (ultra rapid cycling) or possibly my medication, but it's beginning to worry me. I'm active in the conversation, coherent, able to string thoughts together just fine, but immediately after the conversation ends I have no memory of it. It feels like the words are reverberating through my mind, no real words just sounds, and I'm finding myself having to ask what was just talked about. I've never had real issues with paying attention (anxiety can get me sometimes, and the occasional spacing out in class), but this has become a real problem. I don't remember what the topic even was, and if it was someone I had just met I don't remember meeting them, much less having a conversation. 

Is it possible that it's a medicine side effect? I've been on lamictal for 3-4 months now, and just recently upped my dosage to 300mg (the problem as existed before the increase) but every day it seems to be getting worse and worse.

May not seem like much but after weeks of sleeping one or two hours a night it was sweet dreams. 
Finally I'm getting better and we find out our insurance is going to lapse for three or four months. We don't have the money to pay psych and meds even through they're generics. So I tell my shrink today. She says she'll write scripts for me for three months BARRING any emergency. Which at that point I'd need to go in. But after all I've been through this is the best news I could have hoped for. Things will still be tight with paying for the scripts, but that money will help with bills.
Time to tighten our belts and me to stay healthy. Please just for awhile....let me hang on.

TL;DR lapse in insurance, pdoc will write scripts and schedule appt. when insurance is covered again. 3/4 months barring any emergency.

Sounded great and we arranged to be at the same dinner at the same time so I could meet this girl. My cousin warned me up front that she was bi-polar but was on her meds so that set my mind at rest. The girl I dated a year prior was on meds but refused to accept she was bi-polar and was a nightmare, so I was not keen to go down that road again. She would say hurtful things to me, was manipulative and would jump from one guy to the next. I tried to reason with this girl but it was just not happening. One night while she was driving she screamed at me like an unhinged person because I was literally 5 minutes late for dinner. The sex was really good and we got along OK but not great in general. I am very glad she is out my life and regret ever being with her. She made me miserable. What I have learned now is that being bi-polar is tricky and they are not all the same. S (I will call her ""S"" from here on out for reference) was almost completely different.

Myself and S, hit it off right away. We were both attracted to each other in many ways from the start. After a few minutes I did notice the one conversation would be filled with laughs and then the next she was dead serious staring at me intently. Too intently like a hard of hearing person trying to decipher what you are saying or a guy breaking bad news to a girl. I believe she may have been off her meds that night since she was drinking. No mood swings, just a big change in our conversational states. We were consumed by each other and we ditched the group we were with because our conversation was so engaging. We hugged a few times, took photos together and at one point she let slip the words ""can you fix me?"".

We had an amazing night and it was obvious to everyone around us that sparks were flying so to speak. I left S at the bar that night and driving with my cousin later on even said ""did that just happen!?"" because S was straight up amazing in my eyes. I waited 2 days and messaged her. She sounded excited and we arranged to see each other the next day. We met at the beachfront and ended spending time there late into the night. We spoke about her meds, her 2 suicide attempts, various life experiences. She had harrowing tales to tell but nothing really seemed to bother me. No, I would not consider myself blinded by lust/love/whatever or naive, I simply have empathy and was touched at how open she was. We liked a few of the same obscure movies and she worked in the relatively same field as me. She was in between jobs which worried me a bit because I could see a person who felt they had no purpose, having nothing to define them. At that point I hoped that she found something quickly because that can unravel any person regardless if they are Bi-Polar or not.

Things were really good and we saw each other every day for the next week and a half. I could be myself around her, she was no effort to be with and it was a lot of fun. She was a beautiful person inside and outside. I have a theory that a lot of people in the world are not capable of feeling love (or at least on the level I do) but I always seem to be able to see it in their eyes. I saw it in S's eyes. A lot of passion and a spark that lit up like a thousand moons when she smiled. I also saw someone who was reaching out and did not want to be alone with her condition. Also in my eyes she seemed to lead a frustrating life because she felt nobody could feel her hurt and she was not heard. Kind of like screaming to warn someone in a dream of some impending danger and no sound comes out. Screaming under water at deaf people.

After a week we had sex. I was conscious to take things naturally and not rush but at that time it was what we both wanted. Not totally comfortable being that intimate with someone new, it was good but not great. She told me she could not orgasm from a partner because of the meds but could do so by herself. This made me feel a bit sad because she could not enjoy our sex in the same way I did. Was it too soon? A week is a short time and we seemed to be covering ground fast. It felt natural and we wanted each other badly. Hindsight: waiting another week would have been ideal, but life happens. In the bedroom she was quite open to anything and said I brought out a kinkiness in her she had never felt before. She would usually initiate the stage where you go from heavy kissing to something more physical. A good indication in my opinion of someone who really wants you (especially from a ladies side).

I do not fall in love easily and I am one of those people that are only compatible with that 1-in-a-million person being quite a unique personality myself. I felt S was one of those very rare people. Outside of her I would say I have only ever loved 1 other girl in my 35 years. The next night she was at my house and a friend was crashing on my couch. She took her meds and then later took a painkiller. At this point it did strike me she was of the frame of mind that there is a pill for every little problem in life. The two pills did not mix and while she was coherent, she lost all inhibition and became a total extrovert which was the opposite of her normal state. I felt embarrassed for her because she was making a fool of herself in front of my friend who she had just met e.g. talking about us having sex in the next room and flashing her underwear. It was scary to see that change and I thought she was experiencing some sort of mania. When she left I held her and looked in her eyes and asked if everything was OK because she seemed to be going through something. She said she was fine and I could not talk her into staying the night as opposed to driving 30 minutes home. This was a once off occurrence. The next day she felt embarrassed. 

We saw each other about 3 to 4 times a week from there on out. Our actual ""relationship"" lasted a grand total of 3 weeks to put this all into a time frame. I felt very happy with her and content but was not overcome with these feelings which was perfect for me because I knew I was thinking clearly as not to overlook any of her issues. We touched on the suicide attempts only a few times since it was a subject I was building up to and did not want her to talk about anything that made her feel uncomfortable. This is lengthy and I am making it so as to give any poor soul out there as much to identify with as possible. She was very shy and introverted around my friends, not saying a word yet her and I could talk for hours. In fact so much so that we could never get through an entire movie. We would either end up making out or talking. She told me a few things which she said she had never shared with anyone, even her doctors. I let her know I was very touched she felt she could share these things with me and lovingly encouraged her to share them with her head doctors. Not being naive for a second I knew from the start she would always be bi-polar and I could not help her, but rather support her and be as strong as I could. I was not afraid of this mood condition she had and let her know often. She was always apologetic about it and expected me to run away. In summary everything was good and my love grew for her a lot in that short time. At this juncture there are some of you reading this shaking their head and thinking I am ""one of those sad dudes"". I can disagree with you right there because although always wanting someone to share things in life with, I have always been perfectly happy being alone, am a very confident person and have a good self image. Granted I am far from perfect and have my issues but feel like none of them come in to play here.

We had an accident the one night where I did not realize the condom was broken. Right away we agreed that there was no way it was a good idea for a baby to appear at that juncture. She took the morning after pill and the whole time I let her know that despite it being so early in our relationship, that I was not going anywhere and was there for her all the way. We stuck together. After her test came back negative she praised me for dealing with it so well and being there for her. This filled me with a lot of confidence for our relationship to come because we stayed cool and tackled the problem together. At this stage I felt that nothing could stop us and I got the impression that I had proved to her I was the real deal and not just another guy in her life.
Now I have established how our relationship was going and perhaps you might get an idea why I would be so attached after only such a short time.

For the life of me, I can't do anything. I stay in bed all day in a anxiety-ridden, paranoia-filled brain fog. Can't sleep at night unless I take otc sleep aids.

Although I do have moments of mental clarity(hypomania?), most of the time, my brain is mired in depressive rumination and anxiety-fueled worrying, and PTSD-related flashbacks.

But the worst part is the complete lack of motivation and inability to do anything constructive and moving forward. Trash has piled up in my room with the accompanying roaches and flies and I've gotten used to it. I live alone, so apart from when I'm getting food, i live in  social isolation. I do get phone calls from family and friends regularly(every few days or once a week).

Please. What do I do? How do I get out of this hole I've been stuck in for months? For reasons I can't go into, going to a p-doc or therapist is not feasible. No family or friends either. I'm on my own. I would definitely try overhauling my diet(fast food for the most part) and exercise(nonexistent), but I would need to get out of bed for that. And I only get out of bed to go the bathroom or get some food.

What methods/strategies has worked for you to get out of a severe depressive slump? Are there over-the-counter medicine or natural foods/herbs that are helpful for brain stability?

However, it's been 8+ months since I've been with anyone and I think I'm suffering a bit of self-fulfilling prohecy - i.e. it has been too long ergo I won't be any good/not confident enough to hookup/date/relationship with the opposite sex. Throwing the need to cut down on alcohol, medication, stigma around the disorder etc, I'm just really not sure how to navigate this area of my life. I have a pretty great social life but I get pretty down about the fact that I feel further and further removed from the opposite sex, even though I'm young-ish still (mid-20s).

It was something along the lines of, Mom I need help, I dont know how to or who to ask, please help me. She got on a bus and was over here in 30 mins. 
When she came I was sitting on the concrete crying, she got me up and sat at the table with me. I told her I couldnt leave the house and I was scared and sad because no one noticed. My mom said although she did think something ""was up"" she thought she was doiing me a favor by keeping her distance. To be fair, in the past this has been our relationship. I do tend to shut her out,  we can go many days with out contact. I told her i didnt want to live that way anymore. She of course said 'you should have called me' In retrospect...yeah that would have been best, at the time though I was so disconnected i couldnt contact the outside world. 
She came with me to the bank and run some errands. I needed her there to face the outside world. She said her couch is always there if I cant/dont want to be alone.
I asked her if I existed and she said, i dont know do i? and it made me laugh inside because what is existance anyhow?

I told her I needed her   to get back to reality. She helped me take my kids out to the beach the next day . I told her I was still not alright, she said I was a lot better compared to the day before. 
I was able to take the 3 kids and mom to the beach for an outing, seeing the kids was great. They never mentioned anything about the 'hiatus' but thats whats great about kids, they love no matter what. I had all the kids to myself from 6-9. They didnt mind the mess. 

I am so glad i took everyones advice and contacted my mum. Im so glad I had all you and your kind messages and comments. If I didnt have this group Im not sure where I would be right now. 
I have 2 appointments next week, one for a psychiatric program, through our public health care system(for my existinf Bipolar), and one with a private psychiatrist(for my PTSD) . I know I will make it now. 
I am still a bit nervous and anxious. Driving and being in public are huge triggers especially driving. Im still having nightmares about car accidents (sidebar: was hit by a car in feb, never saw anyone for dealing with the possibility of PTSD)  

I think im on the mend guys.

If you ever feel as low as I did the last 10 days, please tell someone, anyone, take the power away by telling someone you trust/love what is going on in your head. 
Things that also helped me:
I kept taking my meds, every day. Including my sleeping pill, I had a solid sleep through the hypomanic episode
I made an appointment with my fam dr and saw an on call dr before my actual dr appointment. The on call dr referred me to the psyc clinic, so the referral came in before my fam doc appt. My fam doc saww me and gave me a lot of support. We came up with an emergency plan, if I felt suicidal I was to go to the ER. and  I made an appt to see her in 2 weeks.
I vented to the bipolar community, helped me realize there are others out there, and i was not entirly ALone.
I kept busy with ""healthy"" Mania, my doc thought that was hillarious (in a good way) I told her I was manically gardening, like 12 hours a day. But I wasnt harming myself, and now my garden is amazing. I call it my healing garden.
I kept myself bathed everyday (something I struggle with during depression)
I got A LOT of sun and took liquid vitamin D

Things I did that were not helpful:
Isolation, hiding, going awol: People are use to my dissapearing act apparently, I told my people if they dont hear from me to either call me or my other support person.
Smoked copious amounts of pot
Didnt eat, drank coffee and smoked cigs all day.
Took too many pain pills and psyc meds and poisoned myself
Didnt clean. my house still looks like gravity ceases to exist. 

TL;DR:
went from complete isolation for 8 days spiralling into a manic depressive episode to back on track and starting to heal after texting my mother.

In the spirit, I'll share my story. 

I was seventeen, it was November 2013, I was dating a guy for three years of my life (anniversary on the 14th), and everything was splendid. Suddenly, I didn't act like myself, and I didn't know what was happening (at the time). Obviously I was manic, but had no clue. So I cheated on my boyfriend, started dating the new guy and dumped the three-year boyfriend (who was going to propose to me in a month), and was happy for like, eh, two months, until the mania spiraled into depression. That was the lowest point of my life. The new guy wanted to ""fix"" me and I didn't know what was broken, just that I had been really happy and then got super depressed, to the point of sedation to avoid suicidal attempts. My mom brought me to a psychiatrist, as she suspected my bipolarity (she's a nurse). I saw the psychiatrist on FUCKING VALENTINES DAY, where three days prior my new ""awesome"" boyfriend had dumped me because he got tired of dealing with me, and decided to date a new girl instead. So I was sitting in the psychiatrists' office, crying, and text-fighting with both my best friend and my new-ex boyfriend. My best friend had taken my ex's side, and completely turned on me. They were hanging out. I saw the psychiatrist, learned horrible things about my childhood behavior from my mother, and was diagnosed. Bipolar II. I dated my best friend for a few months, when in reality, we were best friends who kissed, nothing else. He helped get my back on my feet, and thought I was the most attractive person in the world. He made me feel wanted, even though I had gained *fifty* pounds from the hefty (10x the normal) dosage of HORRIBLE bipolar medicine. Later I found out that he found me repulsive and spoke badly about me to his friends, even though we would all often hang out. Anyway, I was about to head off to college, and we mutually decided to go back to being friends. It worked. Yes, we are still best friends today. My other best friend wanted to fuck me, but again, I was going to college and he was going to a separate one. Then…
My recovery. I had some time off to myself in college. I got into the marching band, made friends, learned about myself. A few weeks in, I met my now-boyfriend. He helped me understand a lot about myself and realize that I was not repulsive. I was edging off the horrible medicine, and losing weight rapidly. I horribly missed my three year relationship and my boyfriend now helped me realize how unhealthy of a relationship it was, and helped me get over him slowly, just by talking with me about it. He did not in any way pressure me to get over him, it just so happened that way. He understands my disorder and has learned how to cope with it. We have a great, loving, relationship and he helps me so much. He deals with a lot of shit that normal people wouldn't, and often reminds me to take my medicine and helps me calm down (I have an anxiety disorder as well). He loves me for who I am, and fell in love with me at my worst. He was rewarded with the real me, who came out of hiding after finding a stable psychiatrist in my new college town, and medicine that doesn't make me feel like a zombie.
It'll get better, guys. You'll get out of that hole. Just remember that, ""everything will be okay in the end; if it's not okay, it's not the end.""

All I knew was I hadn't been sleeping and I was in a dark room in meditation class and there was a scary monkey in a little hoodie coming at me wanting to kill me and I was just trying not to scream.

2- while to a point my medication doses are the way they are so I can play with them and adjust as needed, but it seems dropping my dose low and supplementing with lorazepam if needed and then increasing up again and such with weird amounts of sleep is a shitty idea. Its been a god awful week, right? To get everything done and to basically be 5 places at once, I take 50mg Seroquel and .5mg lorazepam to sleep so I can easily wake after a few hours after fighting to sleep and after spending time before.sleeping waaaaay too much because I had my first period in 2 years (BC normally stops it) and my whole body was a mess/wreck. Got shit done, feel like a badass, nap during yoga class, lather rinse repeat. 

3- Trying to go to 100mg Seroquel and .5mg lorazepam (normally I rarely take lorazepam, but I've been super stressed and a mess and I dont wanna start doing the ocd type ticks that I do when stressed cuz the one with my mouth I've done for 7hrs straight before... it hurts and exhausts me) and staying up til 3am, normally shouldn't be a problem in theory, I mean I had a day where I got more sleep, right? Noooo, I go to bed at 3am because I'm starting to hallucinate and the whatever that is staring at me probably wants to kill me because all of my bp2 hallucinations fucking want to kill me! The only ones that don't want to kill me are the spiders/insects because they just scurry in absurd hoards minding their own business and I freak because im afraid of insects...

Wake up about 4, 430ish from constant nightmares and jerking myself awake every 10-20min, freak because new bp2 hallucination is staring at me and scary and my boyfriend isn't in bed where he's supposed to be.... try calling his name but not too loud as to not wake up anyone else... no luck, notice some light outside the room, tiredly stumble out to living room and see he's on.the computer doing some work because he can't sleep... cuddle up on couch and damn near cry when he encourages me to go back to bed and rest. Cling to him begging ""please don't make me go back in there alone."" He tells me I can sleep out here by him while he finished working, lay head on his lap, sleep soundly until 6am when he wakes me to say its time for bed. Carries me back into bed by request because im too sleepy to move... asleep the instant im in bed. 

4-reach a point where 100mg with or without lorazepam is okay but still not perfect (usually take 125-150mg) but dont seem to hallucinate... still crazy stressed though, but no further hypomania like the night I got my period and got incredibly sick and was up all night and slept most of the day. Can safely survive off this for another day or two so I can finish the last of my school stuff and other absurdities (fuck my theater group), then go back to 125-150 Tuesday evening and sleep until Wednesday afternoon when I see my psychologist.

5-at least I've been pretty good about remembering my 50mg daily dose of Lamictal?

6-sorry this is so random and jumbly and odd.... I've had to miss the past two sessions with my psychologist because I've been sick (lost my voice from a bad cold, and then literally my period makes me crazy sick which is part of why I take such measures not to have one) and I NEED to get some of this outta my brain. Only time I've gotten to talk to my psychologist was a ten minute phone call last Sunday after bad relationship problems/temporary breakup. Things are better with my boyfriend now but ugh. 

7-I'm nervous for rehearsal for theater final and hate my group and hope i don't fuck up but my amazing Redditor ex bf came over and helped me lots and I feel more confident (if you see this, once more I thank you. You're an amazing friend)

I've learned that I shouldn't stop my treatment, even if I feel normal and healthy.

I've learned that it is best to combine therapy (which I have been doing on and off since I was a child) and medication. My psychiatrist strongly recommended that I start therapy, so I will be making a phone call tomorrow.

I've learned there is no cure, and doing drugs (like I used to do) was fairly common in bipolar patients.

Both of my parents have mental disorders. My father has been diagnosed and is being treated for bipolar disorder and clinical depression, among other various conditions. My mother has never been seen by a mental health professional but she has a very paranoid, passive-aggressive personality and is often more unstable than my father.

I understand that I'm not supposed to try to self-diagnose, and that's not quite what I'm doing... I have my suspicions, but will wait until I can see a mental health professional before claiming to actually have bipolar disorder.

So some may remember me, but have had a few issues recently. Originally diagnosed type 2, was recommended to try an SSRI and I politely declined (side effect basis). 

Anyway, I have moved states after many issues and I'm now seeing another psychiatrist, who is really great. He has diagnosed type 1 rapid cycling which I believe is more accurate too. He's put me on depakote, seroquel and klonopin for sleep. 

I just started the regime, and this morning I woke up with really bad diarrhea and mental fogginess. I've also been fairly depressed recently, so lack of motivation and all came with it, but I assume this is not a medication related problem as it should take 7-10 days to kick in, right?

Drastically, no-time-to-titrate meds slowly up or down bad but IT'S A THANKSGIVING MIRACLE! that I seem to be on something that's working (hopefully?).

I've been going through withdrawals, side-effects full-house BINGO, and I'm finally thinking for the first time in what feels like forever that I can finish this marathon without stopping and being like, ""Fuck it, I can't run anymore.""

Now, there was this other person. We met when we were both at mile 18 and wondering what the hell happened to the people who hand out the water and those gross sludgy energy gel packs. But at mile 18, it's all arithmetic. Calories, hydration, motivation -- parts of your body you never knew you had are screaming in pain and all you want to do is veer off to the side of the road and either throw up or pass out but probably both, just you don't know which will happen first. It would only take a few seconds to get off the road, make sure you're not getting in anyone's way, and no one would berate you for it. In fact, a lot of people would probably rush towards you and see that even though you'd been running hard for 18 miles, CLEARLY something was wrong and they'd finally understand why you had to stop running.

Somehow, right around the second time I'd veered off the road and someone pushed me back with a fuckton of nasty-ass but effective gel packs, my friend slipped under the ribbon to the sidewalk on the other side and nobody noticed until she lay down and no one could get her up again. After wondering about where she was for a few days, I finally got the news and I'm realizing that my emotions won't process. Especially seeing as I'm still running this damn like-sucks-so-suck-it-up marathon.

What I'm struggling with right now is the fact that I got pushed back into the race with a metric fuckton of help while she slipped by. I keep repeating in my head the conversations we'd had about life and death, about hopelessness, and about the choice to die. I finally got out of the hospital last week, but my lack of outward emotional response has my therapist suggesting I go back in and for any of y'alls who've done the revolving-inpatient-door thing, it sucks so majorly (right as I'm in the middle of trying to put the mess of my life back together) I'm really resisting it.

I suppose I'm positing here because I feel bad about making some of you worry about me and my intentions to end my life (I did try, and obviously got turned around and pushed back into the marathon) and now I'm in the terrible and awful position of realizing the pain I could have caused others had I'd been successful. Especially around this time of year, which is associated with so much of what is good in this world, it's easy to forget just how hard it is for some of us.

There's also the mention of how when people feel fine it's kind of risky because all therapy/meds/preemptive measures may be thrown out the window and then, well, you swing up and down again.

So I started therapy in a normal cycle. My third appointment is next week and I get the feeling he thinks I'm wasting his time. He asked what I wanted to work on and I just told him my heavy drinking and left it at that. I was half convinced I wanted to fix that.

I'm wondering how one makes therapy work during such a normal cycle. Like, the last two weeks I was fine, and perhaps this normalcy is brought on by an extreme fear of being hospitalized.  I'm afraid that if I tell him about my bursts [I self-injure, last week I screamed at a bartender because she was taking too long to cash me out, my drinking is way up] that I'll run a risk for hospitalization.  

Hilariously, I've snapped this morning and it's been all mixed moods and screaming, so I suppose my problem is further complicated by the fact that I may not calm down by my next appointment. 

So...yeah, how does one work therapy when you're feeling fine?

My girlfriend from the past few years recently dropped out of a college because of depression. She wanted to be a doctor and was in a great pre-med program. She was depressed for months with one attempted suicide (but she backed out last second she says because I popped into her head). She had a doctor who put her in anti depressants and anti anxiety medicine when she was depressed but she didn't take it or see the doctor for long. I don't think I really understood what she was going through until it was too late. She is now having a manic episode and has been exhibiting destructive behaviour. 

She started doing webcam porn sites(hurting herself on camera too) and meeting up with guys she meets on there. She has been doing serious drugs with strangers. She just got a DUI in another state with a stranger in the car. She has had the police called on her by her family twice in the past couple weeks, blown through all her money, and lost both her jobs.

I discovered most of this and confronted her. She said she was going to change her life around and move in with me, see a counselor, and delete these outlets from her life. She agreed and things went well for a few days but then she started getting really angry with me over nothing at all. She would say I was controlling her life and just trying to keep her from having fun with friends. Neither of these are even remotely true. She kept lying to my face  and was continually trying to make plans with strangers from the internet.

She was destroying her relationships with everyone she knows and everyone in her life agrees she needs help.

There was a family meeting and I was invited. After the meeting her doctor section 12'd her for evaluation. She got evaluated by a psych team today and they agreed that she should spend some time in the hospital because of her being a risk to herself. She still has her phone on her somehow and is sending really mean and nasty messages to me constantly. I don't think I should answer her but it kills me not to, so I just respond with ""I love you"". Should I give her space? I love her so much and I know she loves me too but this is killing me inside.

(Update)

So there was an issue with the insurance and it took almost 20 hours to get through but by that time it was too late. The ER reevaluates every 24 hours and today she was released onto the street with no money, phone, or destination. Yesterday they thanked me for bringing her and that I was saving her life probably. Now she is missing on the streets of a big city. What can I do besides pray she doesn't get hurt?

(Update 2) 

So she stayed at a stranger's house for 2 nights and I have reason to believe she shot up heroin for the first time. She came home yesterday but then went to her cousins to spend a couple nights.
 She hates everyone that tried to help her. Especially me. Sending me messages like how what I told the doctors about what she was doing was all lies. Now she's trying to get her family to turn against me. She's calling me the crazy one too. She's saying things like ""I'm not even mad you did this it just breaks my heart and hurts so bad."" 
  Her parents have been split for a long time and yesterday we were all on the same side just trying to get their daughter serious help but now I don't even know where the parents are at on this. 

I know the best thing for me to do is to get out of this but I have dated this girl all my life it seems and past all this illness she is still amazing. I love her and I'm in pieces because of how powerless I am and how I feel like I messed up everything. Everything I did I believe was because I care and if anything it shows I care the most. I have been giving her nothing but love but she has been blowing up my phone with mean messages that are supposed to make me feel bad. I am told this will all turn around when she gets depressed again but I just think she needs to be hospitalized. She knows she has bipolar disorder but is a long way from accepting it. I just want her to get the help she needs. I'm so lost.

(Update 3)

So she blew off her appt with counseler(said that was all the help she needed) and took off in a car with a stranger from another state. Its scary but i guess she needs to hit rock bottom on her own. Just crossing my fingers that she doesn't get hurt. ",['conj'],0,neu_vader

My panic attacks feels like I'll get raped any moment. I hate it. But I can't help it. Smoke helps sometimes. My meds reduced the amount of attacks I get significantly. 

But my bipolarity is still fucked up. I can be super happy one minute or a day then suicidal the next. But my meds helped reducing the suicidal thoughts. 

What none of the meds help is my afraidness of the future. That's how I get my anxiety disorder. The future seems like a super scary place. Did I mentioned I that I was suicidal since I was 7? Fuck. And when I'm on my depressive episodes, I can't help but to think why the 7 year old me didn't pull through. And I should pull through. 

But that's not my problem now. My problem is I met a wonderful guy. After couple of months knowing him, last Saturday night we gotten high together. And the sparks and chemistry suddenly was there, and there went the most awesome amazing make out session in the world. 

It was so perfect. The way he caress me. The way he doesn't go further than he should. The way he looked me in the eyes. The way he kissed me and never avoid my kisses - because I have sharp teeth with a small mouth, I'm used to my kisses being pushed. The most amazing thing, I didn't feel violated after. I didn't feel like I was being used. And I enjoy pleasing him more than thinking of how he should please me. And after the make out, we were holding hands back to his car. And during the journey to my place, we were in ecstasy while holding hands and can't help but to feel just happy. But I had to fly across the sea to resume my studies. 

We still chat on WhatsApp everyday. We wanted each other so badly. We planned for a vacation where we don't have to think about anything else but us. Together. 

And we fought a little bit. I was being a stupid crazy girl and made out with another girl two nights after the most amazing make out with him. He knows that I'm bisexual. He knows that I'm bipolar. He knows my diseases. But that doesn't give me right to do what I did. And he still wants me. Until now. 

He gets hard by just chatting with me. He hates me being sad. He cares. He hates me talking bad about myself. He likes me so much. He adores me so much. And I can't stop thinking about him. He tells me everyday that it's the same with him. He said he will never forget me. He will never forget that night ever. 

But I am afraid of the future. I am super afraid of the future. Whenever our conversation would go into future stuffs, I would automatically cry. I don't wanna lose him. But it seems like we don't have a future together. And I intend to stay virgin and he respects that. But I'm afraid that when we go to the vacation, I will be the one who rips off my own virginity using him. But I don't wanna lose him. I wanna see him again. And I'm afraid that two months are too long for him to keep his fiery hunger for me and he'll move on. I am super afraid that he'll hurt me. Because right now he has that power. But he doesn't know it yet. I am super afraid that he'll get tired of me and leave me which will result in me being hurt. 

I don't know how to handle another hurt. I've had enough of hurts in my life. For once I want this happiness to stay with me for a long long long time. But future is a scary place.

 I (28F) am in a relationship with a wonderful person(31M) diagnosed with bipolar years before we met and is currently medicated. We have been together for what I would say is almost 2 1/2 years granted a split in the beginning (as it would seem is kind of par for the course from what I've read). Things are relatively normal overall, though there have been moments of mania, depression, and more recently anger, but overall he's a loving,caring,funny,witty,smart individual. The problem(s)started off as just every once in a while and has become one of the main issues. I'll start off with the first one: Sex,there's none of it to be had and it's affecting us (me). He has no desire or want or need for it, I feel like the level I'm at is that of some dirty pervert who can never get enough porn. I'm being patient and from what I've read and discussed I understand that it's most likely medications it's just that when I bring it up I.E. "" we haven't had sex in a week, 2 weeks, a month, 2 months."" It's always met with defensive attitudes, and in the end there's never a compromise and usually a comment about my ""insane want/ appetite for sex and reassurance that I'm a person""I know by now it may seem or sound petty to be upset about this in an otherwise ""fine"" relationship. My problem with this is it's not really just sex it's everything, it was an almost everyday activity and he was always so attentive and physical. Nowadays the amount of physical contact is that of you and your close friend. We don't live together and the time we spend together is just beginning to feel wasted I feel disconnected from the one person I want to be closest to.

The second part of this is I feel like our parts in the relationship are not equal, he goes to school, has no car, and lives with his brother everything for him is taken care of financially through his family, whereas I work full time, live on my own and have a car. I love him tremendously but I'm beginning to worry that I'm just being far too co-dependent to see that things aren't as good as they seem.

Then there's the drinking/ self medicating it's not all the time for the record, but at first it was alright you know have a few unwind whatever. Then it started turning into a drink in the morning when he had nothing planned for the day or drinking all of the alcohol in one night. Then he was drinking to the point where it was getting bad first it was just drinking to much,then not listening when I'd say maybe we should stop, then drunkenly talking up my friends co-worker in front of me(which he doesn't remember), THEN almost getting into a fight with my roommate (now former) for breaking a bottle in the street and spending the rest of the night aggressively telling/ yelling to me how my roommate is the bad guy. Each time it's gone too far I tell him we need to cool it or, he will apologize and promise not to drink again or not drink like that ever. This last time he promised me 30 days of sobriety. During our fight/serious conversation last night he got up and opened a beer and told me he was going to drink it. I had told him ultimately it was his decision but it will affect how I feel, he put it back. I feel like I can't take his word when he says he won't. 

Now when things are good they are amazing It may seem like I'm delusional but the connection feels like it's always been that way in a good way. However I feel like I'm at the ends of my ropes nowadays , that I can't give anymore than the 150% I give now. I've talked to him time and time again trying to figure out how I can express what it's doing to me. I've told him I feel that part of my trust is broken, I even told him That Myself would go back on antidepressants if that's really the cause. In my life with my family I have always been patient and I do my best to understand both sides(I come from a screwed up dysfunctional family)but I just don't know what else to do. Everything just feels like it's just that one more piece to push it over, and to me I feel like he knows it. As of the last time we spoke he said he feels tired and weary and that he loves me. I just can't figure out if it's just me being over sensitive or that it needs to be fixed.",['attr'],0,neu_vader

the three big ones were: brain zaps, flu like symptoms, and emotional problems. by emotional problems i mean having an excess of too much emotions for the wrong reason, its hard to explain but its like the wrong things would trigger the stranged emotions. brain zaps i wonder if people know what i mean, withdrawls from SSRIs mean you get electric sensations in your head really uncomfortable.

i was so glad about my progress with the withdrawls i tried to get off my antipsychotic, which is next on the list to get off anyways (im not getting off my lithium or my seizure meds though) but i got no sleep and really couldn't function at all today.

I was diagnosed a bit over a year ago, and over the course of a couple of months my psychiatrist and doctor settled on 1200mg of lithium. I made an appointment for a routine blood test a few months ago, and when I got there, I was informed that I had been booked with the wrong doctor. I'm anxious about doctors at the best of times, and a doctor I didn't know made things much worse.

Long story short, I ended up having a panic attack in her office. At no stage did I threaten her, or myself, I only begged her to let me come back tomorrow. I was *terrified*, which I recognise was an inappropriate response to seeing a different doctor. However, she reacted by having me forcibly admitted to the hospital's mental health ward.

I had to wait in the ""squishy room"" in the ER for five hours, and then a woman came in to question me about my experience with bipolar. I tried to explain, again and again, that I had only had a panic attack, that I just wanted to go home -- but she wouldn't stop asking me if I was hearing voices telling me that doctors were evil. I accused her of being unprofessional after the third time this was asked; she left the room without telling me why.

I had to spend the night, with no way to contact my partner and tell him what was going on. Everybody was extremely rude to me. I had never had any experience in a psychiatric ward, it was 2am, I was exhausted, and I wanted to go home. They forced me to take a sedative so that I would stop crying, and would not tell me what I was being given.

The next day, things were worse. I was given the wrong dose of lithium to take with breakfast. I was forced to drink milk (I'm vegan), and then at lunch I was forced to eat meat. I was given lithium in the middle of the day, which is not in line with what my doctor prescribed. Nobody would tell me why my medication was being fucked with. *Nobody* would talk to me.

Finally, at 4pm, I was able to speak to the ward psychiatrist...

Who filled out discharge forms within twenty minutes of us talking, and told me bluntly that I didn't need to be there.

He was the only person who treated me like a human being. He was the only person who *saw* me. Everybody else kept telling me that I was only afraid because of my disorder. He was the only one who acknowledged that I was afraid because *mental health wards are fucking scary places*.

And I can't switch to him, because he works in the ward. Even if I could, I don't think that I would. I don't trust any medical staff after that. I don't trust doctors, I don't trust psychiatrists, I don't trust nurses... I've stopped taking my lithium. I think I'm annoying the people around me with my moods again, now, but I can't really tell. People, generally, sugar coat things around me. I hate it.

I'm sorry. I don't know where I'm going with this. I suppose I want advise on how to get over my now crippling fear of medical personnel. I know that I shouldn't have stopped my lithium, and I regret stopping, but I'm too afraid of being admitted again. I can't go back there. It was the single worst night of my life, and I'm scared of staying longer next time. But I can't see a doctor without the fear of that happening again.

About  a year and a half ago I had my first really bad breakdown during which my partner (and my doctors) were my sole support. I'd had breakdowns before and was worried how she would take seeing me like that, but ultimately she did a pretty good job all things considered.  Rather than putting me in the hospital, she took care of me on her own knowing I often have had a ""second trauma"" from the hospital experience itself.  The only problem with that, I see now, is that all of my crazy thinking during the worst of it ended up focusing on her.  

She was ""obviously"" having an affair with the lady down stair, I had a verbal hallucination that a waiter literally offered to give her a blow job (she's trans fyi, but passes so that doesn't even make sense) and that she said she had sex with our friend (who is the most ethical person we know).  My thought processes were SO off that I thought our apartment (which had a giant sun roof) was some kind of control booth for the planet earth and I was born to pilot it and avoid a collision with the sun which only secret government officials knew about.  It literally had to have my eyes checked as I looked directly into the sun way too long. .. very scary.  It was a major heatwave that summer in retrospect this is all hysterical and would make for an amazing sci fi movie, as do all of my breakdowns :/ but...here's the thing.. ever since those crazy thoughts about her infidelity, it seems there is a lingering of that ""crazy"" in our relationship.  She was literally asexual when we met, for various reasons, and had only had one partner EVER before me which actually plays into it all.  I keep waiting for her to say, ""I've just realized I'm in love with so and so"" because that part of her is just waking up.  . . so there are legit reasons I could be afraid or insecure and then there is this pile of shit my subconscious dumped on me which comes not from reality but from sick land . . .So my situation gets a bit complex...but i was wondering how common it is to lose trust for one's partner and ultimately if that feeling could be used to ""catch"" a cycle before it got to bad.  And more importantly how to truly heal that wound so that I can love her now without fears stemming from my breakdown.   I've been talking seriously about couples therapy with her and I think, after this recent resurgence of imbalance has been stoking the coals of insecurity and anger,  it's becoming urgent.  But does anyone know how to separate real paranoia from healthy concern and have any insights or support about reversing this problem?

tl:dr Experienced paranoia during my last breakdown relating to my partners loyalty, can't seem to turn it off. . . keep on questioning her faithfulness though she genuinely proves herself time and time again as a loyal loving partner who just wants to get married already. 

UPDATE: slight meds adjustment as well as a commitment to work on some of this stuff in couples/premarital counseling by both of us.  Bumpy, but very promising as I know we will only get closer by understanding each other better.  Thanks for hearing me out ya'll.",['compound'],0,neu_vader

Since January, I have been living in Scandinavia working on research for my dissertation.  While I feel bad even complaining about such a great opportunity, I will admit that it has been a real challenge for me managing my hypomania and depressive episodes here.  I experienced my worst case of depression in the winter here and for the first time in my life seriously contemplated suicide.  I think this was at least partially related to the darkness and my separation from my usual support networks while abroad.  While I had just started seeing a therapist in the US before I left, I cannot afford therapy now in this country, because my travel health insurance does not cover mental health care.  

Now, I only have a couple more months remaining abroad.  While I did have some positive experiences here and meet new people, I am eagerly anticipating returning to the US.  I also fairly certain that regular therapy and meds need to be a part of my life.  This is where I get to the decision.  Before I came to this country, I applied for scholarships to extend my research for another year.  And I have received an offer already from one to pay for another year abroad.  As you might guess, I am less than thrilled at the prospect of returning given my concerns with being bipolar here.  I am honestly scared of what might happen if I were to turn to this country for a full year without treatment.  I am considering turning down the money to stay in the US instead (where my medical plan covers therapy), but this is the first time I have taken being bipolar into consideration for any major decision in my life.  Is this a reasonable choice to make?  Have any of you changed your career plans or made other life decisions considering your mental health?  Also if any of you have experience in grad school, how would you go about explaining the situation to your advisers (I am not “out” as bipolar to my department)?

TL;DR – I experienced intense depressive episodes while living abroad.  Now, I am considering turning down an offer to return to the country because I am worried about my mental health.

When I look back at how I was/acted before I was diagnosed or medicated, I was so much happier, I lived a much more fulfilling life. Regardless of how ridiculous some of my actions were, I was happier, even on down days/periods. I'm not doubting my diagnosis but I don't know if my treatment is working as it should, my moods have been much more stable, but mostly staying low.

I spoke to my Psychiatrist yesterday (before this realisation) and anti-depressants were mentioned as a possibility since I told him I'm almost always down, but I declined and said I'd rather be low than too high (bad experience before). I don't know if I really agree with that now.

I've read a bit about the illnes but I still have some trouble grasping it as a whole. Just so everyone knows she never had any signs of mania or severe depression until the summer when she was 23.

I feel like she is struggling to act like the  ""normal"" girl in her twenties. She gets anxious being in a place far from home without support.

I'm also afraid because she will be living alone as she finishes her last few semester for college. Last time she was alone for a few days (before she was diagnosed) she did the first attempt.

I think about suicide at least 20 times any given day, sometimes a cycle of over and over and over again faster than I could say it out loud.

Hi! Some advice, please: A dear friend of mine is going through her first manic episode (unknown if it's bipolar or just medication-related break) and has been hospitalized.  I have never dealt with mania before.

* What are the best practices in dealing with a manic you? 
* What helps when visitors come? What doesn't?
* What's okay to talk about?  What's not?  (like, when she starts talking about her theories (not sure how to describe it), do you encourage her to talk about it/treat it as a serious discussion?  do you try to remind her that she's only talking about this because of the mania?  just constantly change the topic?)

It's hard for me to visit her; is there anything I can do to help her when she gets discharged? What difficulties will she experience once she comes down from her episode? (for example: after you came down from your first manic episode, were you embarrassed?  withdrawn?  did you remember everything?)

Basically, what can I do to help and show her I care?

Background: We got married on Sunday. Me 29F diagnosed and medicated for ADHD. Attend therapy 2x a month to work on (amongst many things) trust issues. Hubby has attended many sessions with me for support. I have some familiarity with BP due to my child hood friend being diagnosed with BP1 and my line of work has me engage with individuals with a variety of mental heath disorders..


Husband: 28M diagnosed early (age 3) with mild Autism Spectrum Disorder. Due to early diagnosis and therapy, there are few remaining symptoms. He is typically honest with me but initially withheld his Autism diagnosis from me. Diagnosed with BP (not sure 1 or 2) at 16. Has not been treated since college (after father passed away at age 20). 


 He did not tell me about BP until he mentioned needing to set up a doctor appointment for anxiety and feeling like he may need to take off a few weeks from work to get himself right. I attempted to reassure him that its unlikely he'll need to be hospitalized, unless he's suicidal. He reassured me that he was not, but explainwd when he's felt this way in the past, he needed to be hospitalized. This was my first time hearing about this. He told me that when he was 16 he was having suicidal thoughts and had gone as far as to load a gun, but realized he needed help and told counselor at school. After a 48 hr hold he was diagnosed with BP and Anxiety. 


This has thrown me majorly. I knew from what i had learned of his past that he'd benefit from therapy. But i didnt push too hard because i knew it needed to be his own decision. He'd been down more recently, but I'd been chalking it up to anxiety about the wedding and sadness his father wouldn't be there to celebrate with him. Had I known about the BP diagnosis, I would of encouraged him to get help and pushed the wedding back until he was feeling stable. 


I started to express to him just how hurt I was, but I could see him getting more upset and self deprecating so I stopped. I asked him honestly if he could handle my feelings and he explained that he really wanted to say yes, but wasnt sure. So I decided to swallow my anger, frustration and hurt and just be as supportive as possible. We agreed  that him getting himself straight is the most important thing at this time. 


But I am so angry...maybe irrationally so. I just feel like he deceived me because he couldn't trust I'd stick by him if I knew the truth. I'm angry that he took that decision away from me.  I'm angry that he lied straight to my face when I asked if he'd ever been diagnosed with anything else when I learned of his autism.  Im angry that hes gone 8 years without medication management or theraputic services even though he knew he'd been cycling. I'm angry at myself for not recognizing the symptoms. I'm angry that I'm being robbed of my happy in love newlywed time. Im angry that I feel like a fool because I felt there was something he was hiding but told myself that it was my trust issues, and had nothing to do with him. I'm fighting with all my might to not resent him, because he's the last person in the world I'd want to feel that way toward.


I wasn't sure why I came to this subreddit, but I think its because Im scared about our future and need reassurance from those most familiar with the disorder. Is anyone here happily married? What do you need most from your partner to maintain happy/content relationship? Have you been able to find strength from your disorder? What are some major misconceptions about BP (ie- ppl think ADHD goes away when your an adult or that people with it are bouncing all over the place). Do you feel in control of your life? 


 I'm sorry if I came to the wrong place. If my post comes across as offensive, I'll gladly remove. But if anyone is willing, is appreciate some insight. ",['compound'],0,neu_vader

However, the response is and should always be the same: see a doctor and I don't want that to get lost as this sub grows. So, I was thinking maybe we could have a FAQ section that's highly visable about symtoms, treatments, medications and a strong recommendation to get help, maybe even a link to a clinic finder.

What do you guys think? Or do you think it's better to engage people?",['conj'],0,neu_vader

This is the first time in 6 years i have lived with an SO. Basically big adjustments in every corner of my life.

Because my new company does government contract work, I was required to complete a form asking if I had a disability. It did not ask for specifics just ""yes or no."" I marked yes.  It's a small company so my CFO (my boss) is also HR. On the first day she came rushing over and asked what this meant and what they needed to do to help. I was up front about my bipolar  (apparently mistakenly) assuming my boss had some frame of reference or at least enough common sense to understand the ADA. I quickly realized she is one of those that has no idea what ""bipolar"" means to me or her. I answered a few insensitive questions but gritted my teeth hoping she was getting it.  I told her I've built my life on fighting this disorder in every day and in every way (meds and years of intensive therapy.)

My first week went really well. Early last week, I started rapid cycling (three lows in two days Monday - Tuesday) but mostly pulled out Wednesday. In that period of time, I overheard some extremely insensitive comments from said CFO about bipolar (while discussing someone else's suicide.... ""he must have been bipolar."") I also had my personal space violated on several occasions (touching me on the shoulder and arm and another coworker practically in my lap to show me something,) struggled to get her to understand that the traffic at 5pm terrifies me so i like to leave a few minutes early as long as buisness needs allow, and that sitting in silence  (NO cell phone, NO music allowed) makes everything so much worse. Through all of this, as of last Wednesday, she was telling me how happy she and the CEO &amp; she were with me.

Then I got sick. Burnout/sinus infection, I went to her miserable Thursday and was basically told since she has allergies I should suck it up. She came back a few minutes later and said I could go if I was ""really sick"" with some song and dance about how if they are busy I'll be expected to suck it up. So I went home and ended up calling off Friday as well. It's Tuesday and I still don't feel well.

I went back yesterday and as soon as she got in, was called on the carpet for my ""moods"" and she could ""tell."" That she and the CEO had talked about me Friday and have some ""concerns"" about my ""reliability.""  I have a background in employment law and immediately claimed reasonable accommodation and made it clear the reason my mood was tanking every afternoon is that silence drives me crazy and the mounting anxiety about facing my drive home. She immediately made it clear she has no idea what the ADA is or means to them and bipolar at all. She actually asked if I'd been diagnosed! (NO bitch, I found some lithium on the side of the road and decided it would be fun to make up an illness no one understands.) I offered to provide literature on both and told her that last week had been very hard on me with making adjustments EVERYWHERE and that I am doing my very best to shake out of it that that's not my normal. I pointed out that I am one of the lucky ones and that most of us couldn't even have gotten through their interview process. She seemed to get it and back off and was all happy the rest of the day. I guess she talked to the CEO and they shifted my hours officially so I can avoid the worst of rush hour and music with ear buds on a trial basis but they ""better not see"" my phone.

I'm embarrassed and frustrated. I've over performed expectations, done everything they asked and more, and yet 2 bad days out of 9 skews their view of me. The pisser is, had they let me have my music when I first asked, shifted my schedule when I first asked, things last week would be dramatically improved. But now I have to play catch up to ""make up"" for things that have never been a problem in 6 years of professional work.

Sighs. Thanks for reading, just needed to vent to people who know what this feels like.",['relcl'],0,neu_vader

Now I know it is the oldest and really the most successful medication for bipolar disorder however I'm not so sure if it helps and if I even like being on it. For me it controls me but not all the way. I don't really want to go up on the doseage anymore because honestly right now I kind of like the outbursts of anger. It almost relieves me and takes away stress. I don't know if i want to stay on it or just come off of it. Tell you're stories with lithium and if it helped and did you like it.

I am currently on day 3 of Lithium and waiting for the pharmacy to receive their order of Latuda.

I'm just wondering how these two types of medication compliment one another and what effects each is supposed to produce. From my basic understanding, the Lithium is supposed to suppress manic episodes and help somewhat with depression; it is commonly used for long term maintenance while Latuda is very good for depression associated with Bipolar Disorder. 

Besides that, are there any additional effects, interactions, side effects, benefits, etc one should know about the Lithium / Latuda combination or any adjunctive therapy with Lithium / atypical antipsychotic?",['compound'],0,neu_vader
