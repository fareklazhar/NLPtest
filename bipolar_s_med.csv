149,Will it go away as I adjust to the medication?

156,"Part of me, somewhere feels that now my mother will get a taste of my medicine."
157,I was wondering how these meds are affecting others.
158,I am questioning the use of these meds and am looking for advice on what meds are working for others with bipolar I disorder and or including depression.
159,So here is the question - what happened to people with bipolar before medicine existed?
160,"What I'm really curious about is the possibility that people, before psychiatric medicine was commonplace, found ways of successfully managing bipolar disorder."
161,"In the U.S, psychatric medicine plays a very big role in dealing with mood disorders like bipolar and depression, but some studies often call into question the effectiveness."
162,"I know there are people, probably most of you on this forum, who feel like life would be unbearable / insanely difficult without medication."
163,"I know that the rules list to not reccomend homeopathic medicine for bipolar because that is encouraging non-use of psychiatric medicine, which is considered a no-no, and I know that the psychatric community considers bipolar an illness that almost 100% of the time requires medicine to deal with."
164,"I have this issue where I'll go to therapy for awhile, especially until they decide to try medication (I feel like I can mostly live without it, most of the time, as long as I have something to level me out if I get symptomatic) and then out of nowhere my mood swings back to something resembling ""normal,"" and I suddenly decide I'm fine and I don't need therapy, why, maybe I'm not even bipolar (ha)."
165,"I try to handle it myself with anxiety meds only when needed and marijuana (which calms me down and helps me think straight) and to just work through everything, but I'd say we all know that doesn't always work as expected and can even backfire."
166,"I'm terrified to even try medication, whether it would grant me respite or not, for some reason it scares the hell out of me."
167,"I got diagnosed, it mellowed out, got more severe again and finally I went on medication about 4 months ago."
168,"It wasn't as severe as previously - I dismantle to calm males enough to sleep, but my boyfriend says I should talk to my doctor about changing the medication or something."
169,I used to have very obvious cycles before I was on the medication.
170,I have been taking meds  every day since 011 and I feel good.
171,I've had highs and lows this week but I combat them with my list of things that help and my counseling if that doesn't work I take my meds  for a few days until it's under control  and I go back off.
172,Does this mean I'm ready to be on meds  only when.
173,Are medications my only hope?
174,"I was offered medication, or advice."
175,I refused medication mainly because i watched Secret Life of the Manic Depressive.
176,So i went to my GP again and said i wanted to talk to somone about long term medication.
177,I know the mental health team and medication is what i want.
178,"I'll not sleep, crank out pages of drawings and loads of short stories and i'm scared of medication taking that away from me."
179,"**TL:DR: Can have appointment to go on long term medication, scared of loosing manias/hypos which seam to be the only thing i have going for me."
180,So I have been thinking of stopping my meds.
181,I feel great and cant tell if its the meds or just who I am naturally.
182,Ive lived without meds for about 7 years(dignosed bipolar at 13).
183,"EDIT- I will take my meds until I can talk to my doctor, thanks for all the support"
184,From both the transition and the medicine itself.
185,"Hello All i have been diagnosed as depressed years ago as well as being bipolar and i have completly ignored the diagnosis untill two days ago where I had a episode that resulted me in the mental hospital

Does anyone have any advice on how to take control back of my life

Im back on meds dont like it but if it keeps me straight then its worth while"
186,"Been on the meds for a year, and did pretty well with them initially, but lately I just feel numb."
187,"I'm working on finding medications to stabilize my mood, but it's a slow process."
188,No meds.
189,"When I first started meds, first started dissociating."
190,I've agreed not to move anytime soon - added extra therapy and another medication and my doctor has approved a week off work for me to get to a place where I can focus again.
191,I was wondering if anyone takes medication for both anxiety and bipolar disorder and what medication it is?
192,I have an appointment with my doctor july 16th to discuss meds and im nervous about it.
193,"Found a great therapist and psychiatrist, was diagnosed (BP2 was a big fucking surprise to me), got meds, stopped drinking,  and for the last 2 months I have felt great."
194,Been taking medication as well as seeing a therapist for 5 of those years.
195,"I've been hypomanic for the past few weeks and despite medication increases (going from lamictal 100mg to 200mg and seroquel 25mg to 100mg), exercise, and eating right, I keep going up and up and up and up."
196,I was off my meds for about ten months and had some smaller episodes in that time with some bigger ones added in.
197,"I might not have a bipolar disease and some other form of depression, or maybe I am just a hormonal teenager who thinks sadness is more than just sadness, but I would really like some advice on how I can keep myself in check without the help of medication or someone to really talk to until I am 18."
198,When I'm on medicine I can be alone for a long time on end and never need anything.
199,"... not to sound dire, but even when you think you have EVERYTHING going - insight, doctor access, medication, general health and employment, supportive partner and friends - this shit comes back and hits you and WILL topple things."
200,"Further, his father is bipolar and has a long history of being off meds and generally ruining my friends young life."
201,"I assure you I am not a 'dangerous' person, I am very calm, reasonable, and mindful of my emotions (in fact, much of my current background involves conflict resolution and diffusing difficult situations), but there is more to managing Bipolar Disorder than just taking the right meds."
202,"One or two of you may understand what it is to have your affect blunted for most of TEN YEARS, your sexual desire coming out for MAYBE one week every three months, and wondering every day if it's the medication, the situation or YOU."
203,So adhd meds were late.
204,I haven't taken medication in like 8 months.
205,"I haven't been feeling any symptoms or anything, but just for the sake of being responsible (and nothing wanting to go through that incredibly hard time) I have been considering going back to the doctor and getting medicine again."
206,"After I came off the medication (lithium) my mother had me taking lithium oratate, omega, and ""power pills."""
207,"So anyways my question is, after going off medication how soon did you have your next ""episode?"""
208,"Also have any of you been able to successfully deal with it long term, without medication?"
209,"TLDR: Haven't taken medication in a while, when do I need to go before it is too late?"
210,My son is 13 bipolar not on meds (yet) I feel I need medications to handle him.
211,The last medication I was on a couple of years ago was Lamictal and Klonopin for anxiety as needed.
212,"Anyhow, I've been tossed out of the psych medical system because I'm told since I'm not able to take meds, they can't continue to treat me."
213,"I can't take meds, I'm without psych support, I'm not one who does well in group therapy because when I'm listening to other peoples problems it makes me feel even worse then I end up crashing emotionally."
214,"The problem is that although I think my medication is working, I'm not *completely* sure."
215,"**

**BIPOLAR RELATED:**

* I haven't had a single episode since I started my medication, so that's already a good start."
216,"* I *want* the medicine to work, badly, so I'm afraid of that clouding my judgement."

222,I don't want to have bipolar or anything where im in a state to have to take medication to control anything.
223,"For a long time I have ignored all this, knowing I was looking at it wrong or something, but since getting medication and clearing some fog I still feel this way and have these thoughts."
224,"I don’t want to be an asshole, but if it was the BP wouldn't these crazy feelings go away with medication?"

234,She's going to therapy on a consistent basis and taking her medication.
235,Things have been going great for us - she seemed happier and back to her normal self unlike when she was trying out the first few meds.

400,"I've been on a laundry list of medications at different times, and it seemed like just having a supply of benzos to take as needed along with vyvanse has kept me functioning, but Im just coming out of a terrible episode and my doctor and I are talking about putting me back on bipolar meds."

421,I have bipolar II and i recently (last three months) switched medications and i'm not sure if it is working for me or not because i do not feel depressed but rather everything is amazing and i see the beauty in small things like leaves and flowers and bugs and i laugh alot and tell jokes and I dont feel dead but i feel so alive and like i can do anything and i dont know if this is hypomania or mania or not because my previous episodes felt horrible and too fast but now everything is beautiful

423,"I am very, very bad at medication management."
424,"When I am on meds, however, I experience maybe a week of what I call 'normalcy' - very happy, outgoing, feeling like everything is going great and my life is getting back in order."

435,"I thought that my depression would just gradually go away, and then I was informed I wouldn't have any place to get my ""medicine""."

449,"Throughout all of this happening, the medicine I am on which is Seroquel XR, I have had to up the dose to help keep myself 'sane', well I was doing it a lot, my doctor had me at such a low dose it wasn't doing anything...."
450,"I called and requested an earlier appointment with my doc due to the situation, but today realized I would be out of meds tomorrow and I don't have an appointment until the 20th where she could stock me back up on samples."
451,"I have to see the doc, and the soonest that would be is on the 20th... so I'm looking to be going 14 days w/o medicine..I got angry but not with the secretary on the phone and simply said please cancel all future appointments as I will just be going to the hospital even though I don't want to I feel it is my only option to ensure I stay 'level'... Just for a FYI, she had me on 25mg Seroquel XR once a day (that meant breaking a 50mg XR tablet in half) and I was taking 200mg to stay sane, I don't get why she put me on such a low dose as she had me on this med before but it was at 150mg."
452,"I know none of this is my fault, and there was nothing I could really have done...but he just meant so much to me and the loss hurts like hell and now I'm dealing with my doctor not cooperating with me during this very rough time, I don't want to go off of meds as I feel that they are working (at least at the doses I have been taking) and I'm scared I'm going to loose control after I take my remaining medication tomorrow...."
453,(the hypomania and depression being less extreme since I've gotten on medication) Has anyone else went through this?
454,"Photo of my daily pills, and then of my pile of unopened meds O.o"
455,"Sandra has always refused to take medicine (in high school, she was also given lithium but she stopped taking it)."
456,Now Sandra refuses to believe she is bipolar and will not take medicine.
457,"After a call with Mom, she angrily said she would take the medicine, but that she was doing it for Mom."
458,"Her hollow promise to take the meds is worrisome because we think she won't follow through, and without meds she could harm herself or others."
459,I am trying to think of things to tell her to convince her that the meds will be good for her.
460,"I want to tell her that even I take meds every day (BC) to regulate my own hormones, so it is perfectly acceptable and normal to be on medication."
461,But I'm at a loss at how to get Sandra to appreciate the seriousness of her own situation and to accept that the meds will help her lead a better life.
462,"She's involuntarily committed and diagnosed bipolar, but she refuses to take meds."
463,To broke to afford meds until today.
464,"It turns out I have an out of whack thyroid, which I'm now on medication for, but my doctor also said she needs me to to seek psychiatric help."
465,What happens when and if I'm prescribed medication?
466,What happens before the meds take effect?
467,"I 'm afraid I can't cope, and my meds are already proving to be insufficient from keeping me away from suicidal ideation, self-medication, and psychotic intrusive urges."
468,"Nevermind that, my point is now that I've gotten the proper meds and accurate diagnosis, I feel dull and boring."
469,Yesterday I was told by my therapist that if I were to stop taking my meds I'd either end up on disability or homeless for the rest of my life.
470,"If I was able to succeed with just a vyvanse prescription, why do I need all of these other meds that just seem to be making me feel worse?"
471,She is currently not on any meds.
472,":D

My new meds work fantastically, and the therapy I got from my university wellness center really helped out on my coping mechanisms."
473,My primary care and neurologist both agreed to stop this medication because of it's possibility to increase seizure activity.
474,Thing is this medication was working for me.
475,I'm hoping that with my meds and some coping skills that this career will last a lifetime.
476,"You shouldn't fall between the cracks so much now:) your meds won't cost you your rent, and hopefully there will be state funded free clinics for your shrinks and co soon too!"
477,"On meds, off meds, do you think it affected you any differently because of your disorder?"
478,I have seen over 4 psychologist/therapist/psychiatrist ect over the past years with lots of different meds.
479,I just can't find someone that will accept me as a new patent to get back on meds.
480,I know the medication is helping a lot.
481,"But, she also said that the medication I'm on is dangerous (referring to the rash, which I have not had) and she asked me if I even researched it (the answer being yes)."
482,I told her that I just needed time to figure out how to talk to her since I know how she feels about medication.
483,"To that she responded, ""Yes, you do know how I feel about medication, and I don't think it's necessary."""
484,"I want her to know that the medication I'm taking is helpful, and somehow prove to her that it is not a ""last resort option,"" whatever that means."
485,*note: I was on two meds for a year and went off of them cold turkey when I couldn't afford them anymore.
486,I've been doing the medication trial and error since 2008.
487,"I want off meds, but I know I probably shouldn't."
488,Within 10 minutes of seeing me (I dropped this guy after this because he didn't give you options he just told  you take this medication) he told me that I was bipolar and that ssri drugs can exacerbate or uncover latent BP.
489,"I talked to  my GP before starting taking it and he told me this doc is known for telling not interacting but that he knows his business, but if I wasn't comfortable taking it, don't, I was already gun shy on psychiatric meds."
490,"It's also helps keep me away from drinking and so does the klonopin, that was my self medication for the anxiety, which really is only a short term fix, I really don't like drinking now."
491,Now I am 17 and 365 days off of medication with no issues.
492,"I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was 17 (now I'm 23) and had therapy for 1 1/2 years, but never had medical treatment for it (It's pretty usual in germany, that they try any other way before you get any medicine)."
493,I started taking my medication about a month ago and climbing back up to get to my dose.
494,"While things have been rocky getting myself stabilized between medication, therapy and help with a psychologist, my mind has been much better."
495,The medication seems to be working.
496,"He was originally diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and was on some medication that apparently can exacerbate bipolar symptoms (celexa, not sure what else)."
497,"I just make myself more miserable by  looking up stuff about being depressed or reading about side effects of medication, anything really that adds to my feelings of despair."
498,"Later, I learned that during that time he had not taken his medication properly because he thought he was feeling well enough and he wouldn't need it anymore."
499,"I've been on and off several meds for a year for Bipolar 1 (as diagnosed by a psychologist who didn't full take into account my problems with hallucinations) but family doctor has had me on Citalopram, Remeron, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Abilify, and another anti psychotic that I can't recall the name of but it was relatively new to the market."
500,"Rent, internet, cell phn, meds, they all get paid each month, but with regard to discretionary funds, including saving, I have a difficult time budgeting."
501,I was being treated for depression and given some medication.
502,Maybe it was just a weird reaction to my medication.
503,"Usually he gets depressed this time of year, he has changed doctors and medications and he went into an irritable manic state."
504,Therapy is THE best thing I could ever do for myself (and the meds).
505,"I've tried every combination of meds,
Prozac, Wellbutrin, cipralex, Zoloft, lamictal, lyrica, triptel, tegretol, Seroquel, depaokote, Ritalin, vyanese, Adderall."
506,"Without meds I'm depressed to the point if non functional, very up and down, no energy."
507,I often end up taking 1 or 2 meds that help me function to a bearable degree without drastic side effects but it's still not really living.
508,My body has always been sensitive to meds in general but this is getting ridiculous and I'm tired of being a guinea pig and not really living a life that feels the slightest bit fulfilling or joyful.
509,"Take a handful of pills and your good to go, that seems to work for some, their lives seeme to be truly changed but what happens to the others that don't find relief through medication?"
510,"My psychiatrist doesn't recommend it but he never specified any reason why I shouldn't take adderall because of these medications, so I want to get some insight from you guys."
511,my cousin has said multiple times to me that he believes mental illness is something that can be cured through sheer will power and that medication is a waste of time and money.
512,"starting my new meds tonight, read pretty good things about them."
513,please feel free to tell me your experiences with these medications and how they affected you!
514,"Mine's gotten to the point when I have an episode they are screaming at me ""Kill yourself"" ""You are a piece of shit and need to die"" And the meds aren't really helping..."
515,I am so bad that pain meds (Oxycodone) and Valium are doing NOTHING to me.
516,Hes taking Seroquel and some other medicine on top of that.
517,"I'm taking my meds; they seem to be ""kicking in,"" but i can't seem to kick my anhedonia, even with the extreme mood swings subsiding, it remains."
518,"I didn't make any plans for myself aside from trying to switch my meds, which I think is important and purposeful but can't be all that I do."
519,"So I ask, what do you do when you're having an episode that isn't a drug or medication to cope."
520,I am scared of telling someone because I dont want to take medicine.
521,"Is this something I should get used to, or go through changing medications again?"
522,I am doing better one my medicine but even with insurance my total meds reach 200+ a month and that doesn't include the costs of office visits which I am behind in paying or my other bills i struggle to pay each month or the fact most days I eat one meal and snack because it is all I can afford.
523,"I'm decent with my meds, but I know I could be better."
524,"Since being hospitalized, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was put on appropriate medication-- he's been more 'normal' since then, but I'm... concerned to say the least."
525,"Now that he's on some meds and is in the process of getting his shit together and, hopefully, has grown up a bit, he's trying to be the father he never really was."
526,She is also recommending I see a psychiatrist for medication and is going to try and help me find one locally.
527,Took anxiety meds and no resolve.
528,I got my meds reduced because I brought up slight twitching to my psychiatrist.
529,How often did you switch meds?
530,"If you had not stopped me I might have killed myself that day, at the very least I wouldn't have gotten home or taken my meds."
531,"I've always wondered this, that is, can I legitimately complain about ED perhaps caused by meds if I am not actively having sex?"
532,I've been on my medication since then maybe a little longer.
533,For the most part the medication has been wonderful and I've felt better than I ever had.
534,They actually have a friend who is also bipolar and admired me for taking my meds and having my shit together.
535,"So, my plan is to continue getting blackout drunk in the weekends with these guys whom I like and fight the hangover-racing-thoughts with medication that I already take rather than drink more and become an addict again."
536,"BUT, with my recent diagnosis and thus recent medication... it's much better than the last time I was here (also depressed)."
537,It helps to know that even though I'm not in the best place right now... the things I've done and the meds I take have allowed me to be in a better place than I might have been.
538,"Having been officially diagnosed bipolar last week, my psychiatrist mentioned many medications that I could take to alleviate some of my symptoms."
539,"However, upon research I found many people find medication m much worse than the illness itself."
540,"The reasons I was given to go on lithium or other meds was that I have had the hallucinations, as well as in my depression I am a danger to myself."
541,What medication can I take that won't make me gain weight?
542,"I just needed to get this out there, that someone will understand how hard it is to keep yourself together, I work so hard every hour of every day to manage my condition with out medication, and at times like this I realize just how frail my system is."
543,And heaven knows now if there is something wrong with my pancreas or liver there aren't even a lot of meds I could probably try to help me out of this.
544,"For personal reasons, I don't like taking medications."
545,I don't like the idea of taking a medication long-term that we don't completely understand.
546,"I suppose, at what point is medication not worth any risks or side effects?"
547,"I have my moments, but I typically cope just fine without medication."
548,But the effective medications trigger Bipolar states that are extremely dangerous.
549,"After 13 months off these medications, I've made absolutely no improvement to my life."
550,"On the meds, I become an extrovert and excel in academics and professionally."
551,"Off the meds, I cannot function in society."
552,"Past 13 months, completely off those meds, and I'm stuck again."
553,Non-bipolar stimulating medicines.
554,I've already been hospitalized 3 times due to these meds.
555,"When I was first diagnosed with bipolar I went through a roller coaster of trying different meds until just settling with Depakote, which seemed to suffice neatly on it's own."
556,"It also just so happens that on that day I started a new medication, lamictal, on top of the depakote."
557,I'm feeling this awful side effect of stomach discomfort and slight nausea from the new medication and thats just making everything worse and I'm completely rambling at this point.
558,Any tips for chilling the fuck out when meds fail?
559,He is off meds.
560,"He has taken the steps to help us, he started seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist, and is going back on meds."
561,I always end up stopping my medication because of the weight gain.
562,"I know I need to be on medication, but I can't stand the thought of being fat and ugly or developing tardive dyskenesia."
563,"I also travel around quite a bit, and therefore I'm not in therapy, nor do I take any meds."
564,"I've been on medication for depression since I was 13-14, diagnosed and medicated for bipolar after a manic episode at age 19."
565,For the last eight years I've been excellent at keeping up with my medicines.
566,Yesterday I'd been off my meds for three days and I cried for the first time in months.
567,So if I'm off my meds at least I'll feel something.
568,"I've had problems with my medications before, but nothing like this."
569,What's the point of living if I can't handle it without medication and therapy?
570,"I've been on meds (lamictol 100mg, celexa 20mg, clonazepam as needed) for a few months now."
571,"Now I don't know if my lamictol is too low, my celexa is too high, if they aren't working, or if my symptoms are somehow caused by the meds..."
572,My parents loaded me up on extreme amounts of ADD meds but they never helped.
573,I'm not on medication because I was prescribed lithium and it scared me so I just didn't take it or talk to the psyc again....
574,"It's bad, I know, but I'm someone who will randomly stop taking their meds."
575,"This morning I was driving us back to his place and chattering and happy and excited and VERY affectionate, and he stared at me and said ""LadyMoonstone, I love you being so affectionate and happy, but you need to take your meds.... You're manic..."" And I was like ""Is it that obvious that I haven't been taking them?"""
576,"At first I kinda shrugged it off, thinking he was silly, and when I took my meds and calmed down a little but was still sort of going through my manic episode, I pondered more on what he'd said to me."
577,"He also said that people with BPD are the hardest to keep on their medication because they go off it a lot, and they're harder to keep on it than schizophrenics are..."
578,"He says people with ADHD will remember to take their meds and try to actually stay on them, which wouldn't fit me because when I'm not stopping meds all together, I forget to take them sometimes...."
579,"But if I didn't have ADHD, I feel like the ADHD meds wouldn't work on me how they're suppose to Y'know?"
580,"I guess what Im wondering in all this (and I'm sure at this point this post may not make lots of sense, my mind is literally going all over the place, I'm wanting to run around like mad, and I'm pretty sure my meds or at least Adderall has worn off) is if maybe my man friend is right and/or if I should be at all concerned and maybe talk to my psychiatrist Monday about this and reevaluating me and such...."
581,"If that isn't the case, is it normal for not taking meds/less sleep to cause mania?"
582,"I am off medication, trying to be ""chemical free""."
583,"She's an intelligent person, but won't take medication at all."
584,I'm taking my medications as usual.
585,"I feel like I'm PMSing constantly, which is how I felt before meds."
586,After a misdiagnosis by an asshole psychiatrist I was prescribed every SSRI in the book and some other mood meds like Risperidone and finally lithium.
587,Years later after some terrible episodes in my life I'm finally ready to try some meds again.
588,One of the most costly mistakes I made was deciding I couldn’t afford the $600+/Month insurance through Cobra and let the insurance expire within a month I ran out of my medication for Bipolar Disorder (Abilify $1200/month on its own) In late December I started having a manic episode that lasted until the end of March.
589,"I don’t have all the bills in from of me right now but the hospital bills, medication, ambulances, everything else is easily close to $40,000."
590,I had been off my medication for three months at this point.
591,I have something like 40 various medications of various strength and variety.
592,The medication made me pass out in a matter of 10 minutes and probably saved my life.
593,"If you are feeling down talk to someone, reach out, and take your meds."
594,I've tried a variety of medications over the years.
595,Going to be taking half doses of my meds from now til the 28th - can't even afford another fucking prescription.
596,"I used to think it was because of my depression but since I've been on medication, my depression symptoms have mostly been in remission and I've been feeling fairly motivated to get things done."
597,"Edit - maybe this is just a symptom of fatigue, I'm getting very tired of trying meds dealing with side effects."
598,I just started medication again and had been sleeping for a few days but now again I'm back to being unable to have my mind stop moving but I am not motivated enough to get anything done and I have a very very long list.
599,"So, here's my question fellow bipolarbears, is it safe to just stop taking these meds?"
600,"I've been on and off so many different meds, I can't even remember all of them."
601,"I want to try to get off the meds and just try to basically live more healthy, eat well, excercise etc."
602,"After starting his meds he levelled out for a long while, but now it seems he may be teetering on delusional again (trying to communicate cryptic messages to me, says he is talking in ""parables"" that people just cant understand.)"
603,How long before this kicks in....I've never taken meds for BP and I'm two days in and really want to die right now...
604,"I would love in like a year to start trying to conceive, which would mean going off my meds."
605,My moods have been up and down and I am on medication.
606,"Because of the sensitivity of it, I am unable to take medication or even go to a therapist in the open (strict medical standards)."
607,We've made a plan to try to maintain a balance of my emotions without medication and I'm trying to adhere to it.
608,Which she was on these before but has since stopped taking and is reluctant to take meds anyway.
609,"We are working on getting him on the right medication and some counseling, but I am exhausted."
610,Do you know someone who's in medschool and is bipolar?
611,"I slept a lot, felt like a robot (probably because of the meds), became paranoid, ashamed, and scared all at the same time."
612,This is a question that's been going through my mind a lot as I've been working my way towards a diagnosis and the right meds.
613,I have been taking this combination of meds for a few years now- but I have moved back in with my wife and kids after a couple years and it seems EVERYTHING gets me annoyed and pissed off and its been 3 or 4 months.
614,Has anyone else ever taken this combination of meds or have any suggestions to which one (or maybe all) I should get changed?
615,He is definitely severely and persistently mentally ill and needs treatment and medication.
616,"Since around Jan, 2011 I have also not taken any medication under the supervision of my doctor with which I highly caution and am aware is not advisable."
617,"This all just became real, I just got better enough from meds after like several years."
618,"However, I continued to take my medication as prescribed (Lamictal)."
619,"I was feeling down but not tragic and she wanted to switch my meds up as I had now had several ""breakthroughs"" on the Lamicatal."
620,So this whole time she thinks I'm on meds and I'm not.
621,Over the past months I've been toying with the idea of not taking any meds at all.
622,I've slowly been tapering off all my meds.
623,I've essentially taken all my medicine I've been prescribed at lower dosages to spread them out (ex: prescribed 300mg of Lamictal - started taking 200 instead of the the 300 and then 100 when all the 200 pills ran out).
624,I'm worried that I'm going to kill myself (either on purpose (some days I feel extremely suicidal) or experience a complete blackout or go out of my mind and do something stupid (mania)) or I'm going to kill someone else (I don't know how I could but I know it happens sometimes when people go off their meds).
625,I called my therapist and asked if she could give me more medicine but I don't even know how to start.
626,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8ljHOSqc4A

Who's taking the meds to flatten the ride?"
627,Forgot to take my meds last night.
628,I have a variety of medications I take and I cannot express my gratitude for modern medicine.
629,"My insurance stopped covering my medication, because I'm not ""better""."
630,"I only started taking medication 3 months ago, but I'm scared of what might happen."
631,"But the other one that kills me is the opposite spectrum where people tend to think that the happiness ""caused"" by your medication (which in reality is just balancing your system) is synthetic or fake and that you're living some sort of lie."
632,I've been through about 5 different medications and nothing seems to really work.
633,"I keep thinking fuck it, why not stop taking my medicine, why not do drugs, why not hurt myself a bit?"
634,Maybe it's time to try a new medication?
635,I feel like my current medication isn't doing enough to stop these thoughts.
636,**TLDR; bad thoughts.. do I need new meds?
637,"In addition, he put me on new meds and did not monitor me closely at all, even after knowing that I have become suicidal on meds before (it happens with a lot of meds)."
638,"I got really sick on the new meds and attempted suicide, and he says that I ""surprised"" him with my ""out of the blue"" actions and that I am a hopeless case."
639,"She's in her early 30s now, and is not taking any medication for it."
640,"At the time, her family took her to a neurologist who prescribed medication, and on follow up visits, indicated that while she could continue taking the medication, she could also manage the disease on her own without any meds (is this even possible???"
641,"What actually happened is that she heard ""you can come off the medication,"" and she did just that."
642,"I know my post is all over the place, but I'm concerned that in an effort to not want to anger her, her own family has let her manage her own disease, when she clearly hasn't been able to do so; she's clearly a danger to herself when she goes through these episodes, and, while I honestly don't know if the disease can be managed without any medication, even I can see that self-medicating with alcohol and nicotine are not the way to go."
643,"Have any of you self-observant bipolar cycling people been cycling regularly while unmedicated, then began meds and actually stopped cycling and became normal?"
644,"I'm currently not on meds, I never found ones that worked for me, the meds I did take would go down into my belly but they would not stop the bipolar swinging of my mind so I stopped taking them and just cycle regularly still."
645,"It's an uncomfortable lifestyle, I don't *want* to acquiesce to my bipolar, I want to be stable but I just feel like **none of the available bipolar medications stabilize me**."
646,"However, my doc is also considering a bipolar diagnosis, since genetic testing shows that I'm susceptible to it (I have my own theory that there's something underlying several disorders that makes them seem so connected, but until mental health becomes a real medicine, I don't think we'll get answers on that any time soon)."
647,I have taken a couple of anxiety medications.
648,"It seemed to help with anxiety, but I was taken off of it, because that was during my biggest crisis and they changed my meds a dozen times in a few months and that got pushed aside."
649,"I am going to my doctor the 11th of June, to hopefully get on medication."
650,"I want to start my life, but without medicine, I know i will fail and end up in the same boat my whole life."
651,"Hi all, I recently took up vaping (I enjoy it and it calms me - and helped me kick my weed habit) but I'm concerned that it may mess with my bipolar meds (1000mg Depakote, 300mg Seroquel, 300mg Wellbutrin) if anyone has any experience with this and wouldn't mind sharing their story I would be very grateful."
652,"I know I'll be talking about my general history with mental illness and all that sort of thing, I just wondered if there are questions I should ask about medications, or if I should write things out, or does that make it seem like I'm being a bit mad?"
653,"Around 11PM, the meds wore off and I could think a little bit clearer."
654,"I (Bipolar-II) swear to the gods when I think the guy just can't get any worse despite medication and therapy, my father (B-I) has gone nuttier than I've seen him in years."
655,"I don't get it: he was doing so good... taking all his meds, going to counseling, no drugs or alcohol, diligently working at his new job that has him swimming in cash (which is why he's been able to buy so many assault rifles and doomsday-preparation gear)..... and now he refuses to go to his doctor's appointment, freaks out at my mom if she says a word to him, and spends the day either in bed or pacing around grumbling about how awful his wife and kids are."
656,"**tl;dr Been showing signs of stability, got 4 months of medicine for free and got my dog officially recognized as my therapy animal!"
657,I am trying to come to terms with the idea of taking a medication that will cause weight gain.
658,"It would be tough to gain like 15-30 lbs, but I don't think I could stay on a medication if I gained like 50+."
659,Off medication they would tell me to do harmful things or tell me someone is looking at me or talking about me.
660,"On medication, it's quieter."
661,"However, just about every member of my family is depressed and on meds, and there's a history of schizophrenia, alzheimers, and bipolar in my family."
662,"I'll admit I hadn't been taking my medication, mostly because I didn't think it worked (family treated me so bad and I couldn't deal with it) but now I realized I am feeling so much better."
663,Now I'm a firm believer in mind over matter: I do not take medication to control my condition (this may outrage other sufferers but we are each entitled to our beliefs) but I think my cure lies in a healthier lifestyle.
664,"Would it be rational to say, that I can now approach my current doctor and ask him to place me back on the two classes of medicines that effectively treat those two disorders?"
665,"of the meds that cause weight gain are ones that affect your body's ability to handle sugar, and I would want to avoid."
666,"My psychologist has been really helpful and supportive (first session with her was 3 hours as I had to establish some level of trust with her but she only charged for one hour, which was pretty epic) 

She has strongly recommended that I do go on medication at low doses, in combination with CBT to help level it out."
667,"I am determined to make the CBT work, as it does seem that you get out of it what you put in and I really didn't try last time, but medication is a new one for me."
668,I hate the medication.
669,She was noncompliant with meds and just very negative.
670,"I've been taken off seroquel xr, which stopped working for me MONTHS ago, and now I'm on haldol injections, and I take a small dose of the same medicine in pill form."
671,So hopefully this helps inspire someone who may be going through the whole medication merry-go-round.
672,"These waves are mostly due to the fact that every time I have a mood swing or am feeling aloof my family chooses to proclaim to everyone ""o he is must be off his meds""."
673,I want a medication combination that works and makes me feel better instead of me freaking out multiple times a week.
674,"Last time this happened it was worse and I got it checked out, they said everything was fine and it was probably the medication."
675,I've upped my medication over and over the past 6-8 weeks and honestly my depression wont go away.
676,"Since I have been on meds (Invega, Viibryd, Seroquel, Xanax, and Vyvanse since March 2013) I have had an extremly lower sex drive, and I no longer really enjoy sex at all and when people ask me to have sex with them, even if I'm attracted to them or had sex with them before, I automatically say no."
677,"Any advice on this, besides switching meds?"
678,My meds have kept me fairly stable for about a year and I would rather not switch.
679,"Now I won't be on any meds, and I am a mess when I am off of them."
680,"Constant mood swings, suicidal thoughts, devastating depressing — plus the fact that I see and hear shit when I'm off meds

I just want my old psychiatrist back"
681,I've struggled all of my life with ADHD which receive medication for and major episodes of depression both of which I've seen therapists for.
682,My roommate claims that she's bipolar and that she got over it without any medication at all and that I need to just get over my problems because my life hasn't been that bad.
683,It's been this way as long as I remember and it's probably medication related.
684,"I made a lot of healthy changes in my life, I got on medication, I made legitimate friendships with good people."
685,"I've been on meds for... four years running, I think, and life is pretty much awesome."
686,"I am stuck in a pattern of negative feelings and thoughts and before I was prescribed this medication I did have bad days, a lot of them but I had some great calm and content days and those are mostly gone."
687,But I fear that I only will be put on more medications that will negatively impact my quality of life.
688,All the other meds do fine.
689,"Beyond just a general ""my medication makes me stable."""
690,"Usually around 20 minutes after taking my medication I get this ""rush"" of happiness and content-ness and overall just good-feeling that lasts for maybe 2 hours before I settle back into being ""normal"" (as normal as one can get with treated bipolar)."
691,"I saw my pDoc today, and he didn't do any adjustments in my medications."
692,I have a psychiatrist that I have seen for over 10 years but I feel like all he does is listen to my pity-party for a half an hour and then just tweaks my meds.
693,"First off, I took one as soon as I got the bottle at 6pm (I clocked in for my pizza delivery job at 5pm and got my meds while on a delivery)."
694,"The few rehab programs I had as an option, that were free, required me to be off all medications."
695,I just got my meds right to where my head is clear enough for me to receive help.
696,Yes I have attempted suicide twice on meds but me off meds is even worse.
697,My psychiatrist and parents are VERY insistant that I take this medication.
698,What's your opinion on whether I should take the meds or not?
699,"I was on vyvance, lexapro, and wellbutrin because I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD (not bipolar) and I stopped taking all of my meds because I was convinced that there was nothing wrong with me and I didn't want to need drugs in order to function (this was unbelievably stupid, I know)."
700,Didn't take my medicine.
701,"Gather up all my strength and make an appointment for a psychatrist to try and get on medication, told I have to go to therapy first."
702,He completely refuses to seek any professional help even though he knows he likely has bipolar or depression since he doesn't believe any medication or talking can fix him.
703,Would medication be absolutely necessary for this situation?
704,Just wondering if anyone else has used N-acetylcysteine in combination with their other medications on the advice of their psychiatrist?
705,"My psych recommended it to me in addition to my current medication regime (lamotrigine, with olanzapine as emergency mania suppressant) and since starting it I have been disgustingly well (6 months), so my anecdotal experience there may be something to it."
706,"The lamotrigine has been my current medication for the past 5+ years, so it is interesting to see that I am feeling even better now that I am taking the N-acetylcysteine as well."
707,I have a chronic invisible illness (physical) I have lived with for 22 years with little noticeable indications (now) apart from the need to take medication.
708,"Thankfully my meds control my impulsive behaviors, but I wonder if they should also be controlling these negative thoughts especially hen they involve suicide."
709,Is this a medication issue?
710,"I was initially diagnosed with depression (after my first suicide attempt), and was treated for depression until I had a psychotic episode at the university I used to attend (I was 19), and when I went inpatient as a result, they changed my diagnosis to bipolar disorder (rapid cycling) with a side of psychosis (fortunately when I have psychotic episodes, I either just get paranoid and talk gibberish or think I can control things that I obviously cannot, like the weather), along with my course of medication."
711,"I know I need to be on different medication (I'm currently taking Effexor, Latuda, and Adderall) but unfortunately I can't even go to see my psychiatrist until the first day of this semester."
712,I really hate the trial and error of finding the right medication.
713,She is constantly changing my meds and she doesn't listen to anything I have to say.
714,I am still cycling and I feel like nothing works but I can't stop taking all my meds again.
715,"Nervous about taking meds, I started on 600mg bid Lithium Carbonate and then 1200mg bid, 1800mg bid without major effect."
716,"It's worth a shot, since I have already invested the money into the appointments and on the medication itself."
717,"We talked about a few different medications during my last appointment two months ago, but the only anti depressant she wrote down for me to check out was Seroquel."
718,My depression is most likely because I've been changing my meds to be more cost effective &amp; due to hormonal changes &amp; changes from age.
719,"I am asking whether I should take time off, how long would you recommend &amp; think it would take to get my meds (and me) stable."
720,She seems much better now that they've reduced the number of medication that she's on and changed a few of them.
721,"If they can get her sleep meds worked out, she might be out as early as Monday."
722,I havent been using any meds since i got out .
723,I'm in the middle of switching medicine around/changing dosages and I really don't want to have to face them again tomorrow.
724,"She was recently diagnosed and it still in the process of finding the right balance of medication and is in group therapy, and it's been helping."
725,I got the medication but from everything I read online it looks like this is a medication for BP1 and focuses on helping with mania which I have never had and I am skeptical of having had hypomania if I am being honest.
726,"I am asking here because I don't know if I should not take it, or if I should ask him for another medication, or what."
727,I feel like every time I go to the doctor it is like picking a medication name out of a hat with regards to what I am going to get.
728,I'm not seeing much about this being used for BP2 so I'm not sure if he mixed up BP2 with BP1 or if there is some merit to this medication with BP2 or not.
729,"Edit:
I have been on many antidepressants/anxiety meds but never BP medication before."
730,I ran around buying his pain meds and groceries.
731,After he would take his pain meds and fall asleep I would break down.
732,"Whether it's a medication, herbal supplement, or even something as simple as low amounts of caffeine."
733,"I am also quite forgetful about taking medication, but am getting better about this, too."
734,"The hospital that I went to made a mistake with the prescription, and two days ago I am out of both meds."
735,I just want to know if there is any point in taking meds when in the end it's back to square one again.
736,"I was diagnosed last winter and put on meds (Prozac, clonazepam, and abilify) after being misdiagnosed with unipolar depression for a few years."
737,"Now I'm overwhelmed by the process of finding someone else to prescribe my meds and unsure if I should even bother trying to motivate myself to do so because I can't afford it, especially because i didn't feel especially stable even on meds."
738,"But since going off meds almost two months ago, I feel like I've gotten myself into a bad place."
739,Does anybody have any tips for either getting cheap/free psych help or ways of coping with bipolar without meds?
740,"So, my questions are:

-What strategies (apart from meds) do you employ in order to reduce stress (especially when studying)?"
741,"What medications, if any, were you on?"
742,"Since starting my new medications, this keeps happening to me."
743,I got my meds in order and for a solid konth i was feeling stable.
744,I've been on meds for a while now (Carbamazapine) and thought I was doing okay despite several ups and downs.
745,I was diagnosed with BD II almost five years ago and have been on medication almost as long.
746,"Earlier in the summer, I felt as if the medication was making me worse, so I stopped taking it."
747,"My parents found out and forced me to take my meds again (they watched me and checked my mouth to make sure I swallowed) but lately, I've found ways to keep myself in check, without medication."
748,"I've been off my medication for almost 3 months now and I still have many issues, but the problems my meds created have all vanished."
749,How can I tell my parents/psychologist/psychiatrist that I feel fine without my meds?
750,"My BD is not as severe as others, and I still believe medication can help, but in my case I feel that I'm better off without."
751,I am considering dropping the meds completely and trying life again on my own.
752,I have been unemployed since July and off my medication since october and I nailed an interview with my dream job.
753,"The summer between sophomore and junior year of high school I was able to get off the Zoloft, as I was no longer depressed and with the help of medicine had learned to control my depression."
754,"Hey, /r/bipolar, 
I've posted here before regarding medication in the midsts of my looming diagnosis, but, now with an official diagnosis, I wanted to reach out with and extending hand asking for help (just for some extra clarification, i'm listed as nos because i exhibit signs of possible axis 2 disorders, too)."
755,"*posted this on psychforums but realized i liked reddit better

i went on a mental bender(ie year long mania, yay), left school for the hospital, and after a whole bunch of therapy and meds am ok now."
756,i can't remember a lot of last year because of the crap meds they had me on.
757,"Last night was my first night taking it, today I feel in a daze and drunk almost.. Any suggestions on how to deal with this easier and how to get use to the medication?"
758,"**tl;dr** I'm falling asleep and can't move fluidly, because of my meds."
759,"My dad says the therapy, medications, and hospital doesn't help so I should quit all of it and pray to god."
760,Back in the clinic and starting back on meds.
761,"bipolar II, on meds

I had a week or so of a reasonably elevated mood, which began to slide down the past couple of days."
762,"My psychiatrist thought I might be bipolar, but i didn't believe her so I didn't take the meds she prescribed."
763,"In a nutshell
I have a long history of depression, self mutilation, binging, purging, alcoholism, drug use, medication use &amp; abuse for several mental illnesses."
764,Latest medication is helping so much I'm starting to feel freed.
765,Is that normal or should we be trying different meds by now?
766,"Ever since they've put me on Lithium they've acted childish and emailed my counselor about a variety of things including my medication and how it's ""Impossible"" for my diagnosis to be correct."
767,I've been on so many meds over the last 20 yrs (i'm 33 now) that I've lost count.
768,My doctor dropped me and I'm waiting to get into the mental facility but need a refill of my medication.
769,"I don't think it was just him giving up on me by saying ""well your meds aren't working so maybe you're just bipolar""."
770,I guess the word just freaked me out because I've had bipolar friends who never took their medication and really messed up their lives.
771,"Ultimately, I just want to have the right medication and be able to live my life again."
772,"However, about two and a half years ago my at the time abusive boyfriend made me stop taking my meds."
773,I know I just need to go back to therapy/get back on meds.
774,"Between insurance, medication, and therapy, (not to mention my student loan payments) my paycheck takes a BIG cut."
775,It make so much sense now with how I had been feeling and acting and am now on a correct combo/dosage of medication to keep me balanced.
776,"I usually drink coffee in the mornings, no can do with the meds."
777,We had some pretty tough times (I went off my meds).
778,"Most recently, it's Bipolar I. 

I have been on DOZENS of medications in the past."
779,"I lost my insurance last summer, so I stopped treatment and my medications."
780,I also understand that certain medications are better than others for different types.
781,"I probably should be, although every medication I have tried and the subsequent ""loading period"" has felt like a disaster and seemed to make things worse."
782,"She wasn't on any kind of medication at the time and for the most part, coped quite well."
783,"and ""nope, no i'm not..."" back to meds, ad nauseam."
784,"I've recently started medication, currently on 75 MG of lamictal and 40 MG of vyvanse."
785,"Other than that,  the medicine seems to work along with Vistaril for anxiety spikes."
786,is there a way to beat this without meds?
787,My boyfriend is struggling with his meds.
788,"I can try to understand it through the help of my doctors, my therapist, and my medication."
789,My meds have really helped me get to a ground state.
790,"I was going to go into ER medicine, would love to be in a police car to see what is going on, worked in a morgue once..just wherever the action is."
791,This was do almost entirely to the meds I was on and my aforementioned depression.
792,I was on medication that made it really hard to wake up and kept me drowsy for a good chunk of the morning.
793,I know grapefruit can affect some medications; does anyone know whether it affects Seroquel or Abilify?
794,"I didn't want to be on any meds in the first place, but I'm at a point now with the depression where I feel pretty desperate."
795,"I don't think it's the meds, but I don't think I'm going into a mood swing or anything."
796,I hate medicine that makes me sleepy.
797,"My dad's been laid off and my mom only gets paid minimum wage, and are just scraping by to pay for my medication."
798,I have an 'unofficial' diagnosis from previous psych stays and my therapist and am trying to get some kind of offical one so I can get on meds.
799,"Over the years it had advanced with age, causing cycled psychosis with 
a manic episode starting in her 30s 

I constantly remind her to take her meds now that im staying with her and she is in a very lucid and happy state now."
800,I been consistently taking my meds and seeing a therapist once a week and attend a group therapy once a week as well.
801,Now that I am leveling out and the medicines are kicking in I finally went back through my journal.
802,"You can take medicines that will make it easier to deal with life, but those medications take away pieces of your life too."
803,New meds: Lithium (450mg) and Lamictal (25mg 3x a week to build up slowly).
804,"I had some medication changes, (took me off Lexapro, introduced Lamictal and Serequel)."
805,I started trying different medications that pretty much drove me into a rut of depression and kept me there.
806,I was offered medication but I decided to try and live without it since my episodes are fairly infrequent.
807,"I'm on medication, and I'm going to the doctor next week."
808,"He has taken his medication sporadically but every time he gets within sight of normal he gets angry &amp; resentful about being asked to continue, then slides back into total weirdness and disfunction."
809,"Luckily, I've found a combination of meds that work pretty well and have me fairly stable, and I've developed a lot of tools for me to combat negative or illogical thoughts."
810,"I have since gone back on meds (had an insurance problem, plus I'm sure you guys know how it is with the going on and off meds) and am starting to feel more stable, besides being heartbroken/depressed and crying A LOT."
811,Also my mom didnt believe in medication.
812,13 years of my life dedicated to medicine and now it's gone.
813,"All my savings are gone, I have trouble putting food on the table and buying meds."
814,"Once while very manic, if I refused meds, and once recently now that I'm depressed."
815,*The good news is that my medication is starting to work.
816,Also I had to come clean to my parents for the first time about my diagnosis (Bipolar 1) and the medication I'm taking.
817,I've been institutionalized for it and I'm on heavy meds currently.
818,My meds aren't the best but I'm a lot healthier on them then when I'm not.
819,"I have been off and on medication my whole life, treating depression (mainly) but also ADHD."
820,"It is important to get the correct diagnosis because it dramatically affects what medication I need to take, as certain antidepressants will cause adverse effects if I do in fact have BPII, etc."
821,Can i get off medication and NOT go into psychosis again (or a deep crash)?
822,"I did everything the docs told me and I've gotten considerably better, and about 4 mos ago I was allowed to go off my meds."
823,"After 6 months I found mix of meds that worked for me (Lamictal 150 mg, Trileptal 1500 mg.) At the beginnging of April I asked my pdoc if I could try weening off of Trileptal because I had been feeling stable for about 6 months and thought I could handle it."
824,I was hypomanic from reducing my meds and hadn't realized it yet.
825,He begged me to start therapy because he knew I can't do this on meds alone which is something I wasn't able to admit to myself.
826,"My pdoc adjusted my meds some (Lamictal 200 mg, Trileptal 1200 mg daily) because I haven't been able to shake the depression."
827,TL;DR I tried decreasing my meds and it backfired.
828,I'm 6 months pregnant and my doctor took me off of my meds right when we found I that I was pregnant (Around 4 weeks in).
829,Maybe I am screwing my self over my not taking medication but another part of me says its bad to be on it.
830,My doctor took me off all my meds except Seroquel when I was hospitalized four weeks ago.
831,I was told getting off all the meds in the hospital is allowing me to feel and that I am grieving the loss of Faith in my life......
832,The medication started to dwindle in its magic.
833,So I got put on new meds.
834,It lasted for an entire week and as a result I stopped taking the meds and didn't go back to the doctor.
835,I read the signs listing all the medications they'd be cutting both that visit and the one today.
836,"He calls me from the counter, apparently my meds were cut from the program... with no warning.... three fucking weeks after I was told how reliable the program was.... one motherfucking week before Christmas!"
837,"Now all I see is getting fucked in the fog of the holidays, running out of meds and going full psychosis days within Christmas."
838,"I'm taking the meds right now, 2 pills 2 times a day."
839,"I’m also eating well, taking my meds, and sleeping ok, but it just doesn’t seem to get better."
840,"This is impossible for me without paying out of pocket, because my medication expenses are only $180, and no doctor anywhere will charge $413 for a visit even if they accept SOC (which is rare)."
841,Apparently having someone with a mental illness and NO medication is a good thing.
842,I need to get fucked by hospital bills to get medication and see a doctor.
843,I just want my meds.
844,I feel like I have had an endless list of diagnoses and medication.
845,"As far as meds go, I currently take 100 mg Zoloft a day."
846,-Am I always going to feel like people only like me when I am taking medication?
847,"They'll know exactly who I am if I go to talk to someone, so while I could go get meds, I couldn't go talk about any of this because they'll know WHO I'm talking about."
848,"I want to think that my meds are working and this is just how it is to feel normal, but I just have no idea."
849,"I know the meds are there to change your brain chemistry, but do you actually feel different?"
850,Is that really what meds are supposed to do?
851,"My current theory is that the combination of meds and years of therapy is what's allowing me to keep my mind clear while my brain throws a biochemical hissy fit, and while it's obviously vastly preferable to the typical mixed states, it's a little disconcerting."
852,"No money means I cant drive to town (I live on a rural property) to see my pdoc, who I can't pay, and be prescribed medication, which I really really need."
853,I was wondering if there is somewhere I we can send him or refer him to where he can receive medication and a place to live.
854,I need to get back into therapy maybe even take meds again but I have just been so unmotivated to even talk on the phone and make the call to schedule the appointment.
855,What other medication has helped you with the manic side ?
856,"I'm particularly interested in a medication that can help any of these conditions: obsessions, OCD, social anxiety and behavioural addictions (exercise, hair pulling)."
857,Bonus points if the medication does not aggravate hair loss... (I can dream can't I?)
858,He is a hell of a lot luckier than many people on here in that my folks will pay for his docs and meds.
859,I need him to take his meds and see his docs on a regular basis but i am worried about a lifetime of babysitting him.
860,There are many positives to a good medication -- but what are some qualities that have noticeably been affected in a way you don't like?
861,"My therapist has warned me that I will lose some of my creativity, quickness and sense of humor if I get on meds."
862,I also tried some ADD medicine and I never noticed a change in my thoughts like this.
863,"So I think I have found the right medicine combo of 200mg lamotrigine, 12.5 of sertraline, and 5mg focalin."
864,However his mother being the terrible person that she is thought that giving him a cocktail of medication and dropping him at the local psych ward would fix him.
865,"Then I start to wonder how valid the entire basis of mental illness is when I've tried every traditional medical treatment and various medication combinations and had only few month long periods of ""normal"" ever in the last nine years."
866,This is my first time on meds and I'm very nervous about it.
867,"I don't think Lamictal is necessarily causing this, maybe I'm just noticing it more because I'm waiting for the medication to start working."
868,"I thought my meds were working, but I haven't had moods like this in years."
869,"The calmest period of my life, which overlaps with my meds, is when I was addicted to opiates and constantly high."
870,She wasnt on medication for it.
871,"I was diagnosed with bipolar, forced on three different medications and put on suicide watch because of my behavior."
872,"Nevertheless, I continued to get treatment, but the system at my school was so poor, they would swap out therapists every week so I could never build any rapport with them and often wasted time repeating my story, the psychiatrist was rude and was only interested in throwing as many medications at me without hearing out how it was adversely affecting me."
873,"However, I did not take it well and ended up overdosing on my anti-psychotic, seroquel, then drank alcohol on top of that, then overdosed on risperdal, and sleeping medication in my drunkeness."
874,I need someone/something to distract me from this boredom - my meds have just been increased and I'm just waiting the few weeks for them to kick in.
875,I've been off meds since last September.
876,I'm relatively new to medication.
877,Anything I need to stress to my doctor to make sure I am getting the right medication?
878,"It worried me enough that I took prescribed atypical antipsychotic meds (Latuda 40mg) to kill the process, and it seemed to work - although it SUCKED and it's something I rarely do unless the need arises, and my pdoc and I are aligned on this."
879,I'll keep taking them every night before bed until I am clearly out of the woods - it's a lot easier being able to sleep through the worst of the medication's effects.
880,"Today I woke up feeling kind of shaken by the experience - it happened only a little while before my afternoon shift at the restaurant and I didn't have time to call in a replacement, so I pretty stupidly just powered through a busy, miserable evening on this medication."
881,"I feel so good when I'm manic, that when I was on medication, my doctor only treated the depression."
882,"(Do not ask for psych meds, this is the wrong doctor for that.)"
883,Keep taking your meds.
884,"When you're more stable, tell the psychiatrist that you want to try reducing your meds."
885,"I've been depressed for ten years, on medication for five and I've tried everything."
886,"I have another P-doc appointment next week AND am starting weekly therapy, plus the drug copays incurred with a medication change (dropped depakote, titrating up onto lamictal, upped abilify, unchanged cymbalta.)"
887,I am just out of a meds-induced mild depressive state.
888,It just seems to really capture how I feel after I got on medicine and started trying to figure out the right way to react to things instead of just extreme emotions.
889,Has anybody else had a mix of medications like this?
890,"He saw my meds, asked what they were for, I told him, he hugged me, said ""I'm sorry you have to deal with that, it must be hard...but that's just a part of you, and that's ok"", I cried, we've been inseparable every since, he's the most caring/understanding/supportive person I've ever met blablabla that's the gist of it."
891,"I pay rent, cable/internet, most of our food costs, every time we go out for drinks.... plus my meds, food/treats/vet visits for my dog, gas for my car and motorcycle (luckily that one's cheap), my doctor's bills and bills for all the blood work I have to do all the damn time... but we get by."
892,"Now I am in debt 50,000$+ and without my meds."
893,The Nuvigil has helped me be able to function at work (get out of the haze left by the depressant effect caused by the other meds).
894,My meds have kept me in check but things just got out of hand last night and I went into an episode.
895,Almost 3 weeks ago I had to stop my meds for about 2 weeks because I had my tonsils taken out and couldn't swallow my meds.
896,"I figured I would be okay as I was taking my meds everyday, getting my sleep, and avoiding caffeine."
897,"Well, since I had no money left because my job sent me on an 'illegal' unpaid medical leave and I needed the money to pay to see my pdocs and my meds, I had NO choice but to file for partial unemployment."
898,"I did run through the usual list of medications, as well."
899,I took my meds religously.
900,He believes that people with bipolar can learn to live and cope without medication.
901,"Definitely cycling, but looking for support in managing bipolar without medication."
902,"Not sure where else to post this, but I think here would be my best bet as I believe it to be a medication thing."
903,"Never had consistent nightmares before these meds, maybe like once every month or three like most people."
904,In the meantime I missed a few days due to medication issues and they fired me over attendance.
905,I lost my job before that because I passed out at my desk due to medication I was on.
906,"I tried to explain that I was on medication that could cause this, and they told me they'd already told me they were firing me, it was too late to make excuses."
907,"My medication's never been ""right"" and we just keep trying things, and now it's even harder since I lost my insurance."
908,I recently decided to try the trucking method and stop all medications to see how I do.
909,"He is now with his parents, and while he's on meds and seeing a psychiatrist, he's definitely not taking the best care of himself."
910,My pdoc encourages me to keep exercising and taking my meds and I think it's working out pretty well.
911,I would have to practically overdose on this medication to get a full nights sleep.
912,Someone once told me there was a bipolar medication that also helps with focus.
913,My wife is currently in the middle of a 14 day hold in an inpatient behavioral medicine center.
914,She is currently refusing meds and is very angry at everyone.
915,I am on medication because the last p-doc I saw gave me a year prescription.
916,"She got home and was looking at her medicines trying to figure out what happened, and here welbutrin was 300mg pills rather than 150mg."
917,I've been diagnosed for about 3 years now and on meds.
918,Don't adjust or stop/start your medication without consulting your doctor.
919,"He stopped taking all of his medications a few months ago, and his behavior has become progressively strange and antisocial."
920,"I'm almost certain his decision to unmedicate himself was related to his religious conversion a few years ago...I am a Christian myself, but he seems to belong to the type that believes all medication is from Satan(as far as I'm concerned, one of his delusions)."
921,"mine have generally ""good"" (bare minimum good) intentions, but still just seem to make everything so much worse, and add to the stress/depression that makes the usual cycling (despite being on meds) worse."
922,"My mom is already struggling to deal with me, and making sure I take my meds and go to therapy."

926,Next day on meds I was fine.
927,"All of my  mindfulness exercises seem pointless, so do my meds and psychotherapy."
928,I used to suffer from an eating disorder and there are lingering thoughts I'm afraid that medicine that causes weight gain will push it over the edge.
929,I'm just asking out of curiosity because I've refused meds until now because of this reason.
930,I am considering going back on meds but I am concerned that I will stop being as social as I have been since I stopped taking them.
931,Taking meds means going to bed by like 10pm everyday and according to my doctor no drugs or alcohol unless I want to risk brain and liver damage.
932,Not once have I had a relapse to suicidal ideation since starting medications.
933,I used to be an incredibly raunchy personality before starting meds; this would entail my behavior and focus on sexual innuendo and conquest.
934,"I heard that most of my meds lead to weight gain, but I've lost about twenty pounds in the past few weeks."
935,Could this be a side effect from the meds?
936,"Iam so so so mad for all the shit i have Been taking while on mood stability medication, iam so mad for leting people walk all over me and not even try to say something about it!"
937,And makes me sad that people think i am a better person on medication!
938,"At the moment im having trouble with my medication today i broke down about it, im sick and tired of taking meds, i forgot to take my seroquel for one night and i couldnt go to sleep and stayed up wide awake till the sun came up around 5, its scary to see im so dependent on a drug and how much medication i take it seems a bit overkill."
939,"I thought I had a good hold on everything, I thought my meds were working, but apparently not."
940,Has anyone else gained weight on meds?
941,I'm up 37 pounds since beginning meds a month ago and have yet to stabilize.
942,I've see the Doctor only twice so far and I've been put onto medication but I'm still incredibly uncomfortable and all that jazz.

944,I have been off my seroquel medication for 3 years because I couldn't afford it.
945,"I'm not okay by all means, but recently was able to get my health insurance back so I'll be going back on medication soon."
946,Recently diagnosed (after five years of wrong meds and misdiagnoses - that's another topic) - on meds but they're VERY new so we're not sure what effect if any they're having.
947,Does bipolar medication have long term effects?
948,I'm sitting in my room listening to my mom talk to our neighbor about how I'm on meds and seeing a therapist.
949,I had a talk with my psychiatrist and she made it seem that every single medication I could or should take will make me gain weight.
950,"So anyways, I'm open to medication but not if it causes drastic weight gain."
951,The problem is it has never happened to me while I was in medication.
952,"I decided to only take half my medication since last month, and yesterday there a lot of things that went on."
953,"I left my phone on my lap and I started hearing my mom talking to me, but the phone was off, the thing is, I also started hearing my name sometimes, and I just shook it off because I knew I was under a lot of stress, I just thought: ""ok, tonight I will take my full medication, and everything will be fine again""."
954,I want to come off all these meds.
955,My meds help even me out most of the time.
956,I've been diagnosed as bipolar and have been both on (and..umm..off meds) for over 10 years.
957,"I wasn't drunk, wasn't high, I don't ever smoke anything at all - but, I had been off my meds for over a year when this happened...(admittedly my own decision)."
958,I know that I should keep on my meds and that literally every time I've gone nuts was when I had been off my meds for months.
959,"I don't need meds."""
960,For about a week I quit taking my medication (Wellbutrin and Lamictal) because of apathy.
961,I was on several medications for different diagnoses.
962,Is there any way I can make this go away or at least improve the symptoms without getting off meds?
963,so i recently stopped seeing my pdoc and so i went to my family doctor to have my meds refilled.
964,"we were talking about my history with my psych meds and told her i have tried adderall quick release and extended release, vyvanse, and strattera for my add and none of them have been quite right for me."
965,"I discussed potential meds to add or switch to, and it sounded like Topamax, Geodon and Latuda were the best options."
966,"But, what I've researched and after being on certain meds that helped tremendously, I've concluded that I was diagnosed correctly."
967,"(They are two fucked up people with drug addictions and have abandoned my younger brother who now lives states away)

I don't have health care currently and stopped my current meds because I couldn't pay for them without help, Strattera and Lamictal."
968,"I haven't had strong symptoms, no definite episodes since I got off the meds."
969,"Questions.. 
Will I have to go back on meds?"
970,"Quick edit, I've been off my meds for about 2 months now."
971,Anybody else mix alcohol and medication on occasion?
972,The pdocs fucked up her meds so badly that she has to come off everything and start over.
973,"I got put on a couple medications, but I'm worried the depressed ""low points"" will continue to haunt me and that my emotions will continue to be difficult to handle."
974,She said it was just what the medication does to everyone.
975,Never before have I felt so bad on a medicine (besides Abilify).
976,"I don't cease my meds for any reason, but this one is bad enough that I am going to stop taking it."
977,"I am 26, f, married, currently on medicines for OCD, panic attacks and Anxiety."
978,"Yesterday, my mom told me that my brother is back on his bipolar meds but only for six months."
979,"She seriously feels he has been under-diagnosed , because his symptoms appear as severe as his first episode, when he had to continue meds for a year."
980,"I don't even know what is the proper duration of the medication, or did he discontinue the treatment on his own."
981,"I do not understand because I am taking my meds, eating three generally pretty healthy meals a day, and I have even been exercising everyday to combat my usual winter blues."
982,"She was diagnosed a few years back, actually hospitalized for a few weeks during one episode and had such a scare from being in the psych unit that she is completely afraid of going to the doctor now or taking medicine for fear of being held again."
983,Filed FMLA due to ongoing pdoc and psych appointments and lingering fear the meds would mess me up too badly.
984,"I'm on four different meds, Paxil and Wellbutrin, which I take in the morning, and Zyprexa and Trileptal that I take before bedtime."
985,Should I switch the times I take my meds?
986,My medications aren't helping much now and I have been updating my psych every time I see him.
987,"I'm not looking to start any nasty habits, just that I have friends with BP who are still using here and there while on medication and I'm worried that their health might go south."
988,The only difference is that I take my meds (even when they don't work) and don't abuse my child.
989,"(usually in a negative way)
Right now, I just ran out of medicine for the hallucinations and won't be able to get more until Wednesday."
990,"http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/yf54d/my_fiance_23_of_2_years_who_is_suffering_from/

I do not plan on breaking up with her, but instead helping her through this crucial initial recovery period as we balance out her medication and get her in with a therapist and psychiatric."
991,She is still having some hypo-manic symptoms and needs to find and adjust to a therapeutic level of medication.
992,I don't take medication anymore for it because I like to pretend I am normal.
993,"I am a 18 year old female, I recently went to a psychiatrist and though I was not diagnosed I was given a mood chart and medication that are mood stabilizers and anti depressants."
994,My medication has been helping and I do have 2 people really close to me who I trust and encourage me to continue bettering myself.
995,About two months ago I started smoking weed again while on my medication (Zoloft Wellbutrin Depakote) I believe the Zoloft triggered me into a mild hypo manic version of myself which led me to smoke weed.
996,I've stayed on my meds but I can tell I'm being very short with people and get easily annoyed.
997,"I was put on celexa to help with some depression &amp; anxiety not too long ago (about 3 days ago), and ever since I started taking the medication, my jaw has been clenched almost non-stop."

1002,"Hi guys, I just wanted to update [my post of about a month ago](http://bit.ly/GFubkf) about my meds!"
1003,I'm kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop - it seems /too/ lucky that my first combo of meds has worked out so well.
1004,I've been on my meds for the last year.
1005,I've tried talking to zir about taking medication but she is adamantly against it.
1006,"My dr. has always said that I never had to continue taking my meds if I didn't want to, since I was voluntarily seeking help."
1007,I'm just not sure if I should even bother with taking the meds.
1008,"I don't want to go back on medication because I wasn't getting the ""highs"" I now get when I spend time with my daughter."

1010,"I know that they can exclude you based on existing psychological conditions and medication, but is it a blanket exclusion or based on case-by-case assessment?"
1011,"Other than more meds, that is; I'm discussing that with my psychiatrist in a few days."
1012,Stealing the remote...she said she thought he had gone off his medications without telling her.
1013,"The difference between me and mom being that I knew and understood exactly when my brother was off his meds, as opposed to her obliviousness to her own husband's affliction."
1014,"I told him that he needed to start taking his medication again, but he said it didn't help."
1015,I have looked everywhere to find a free to low cost doctor to prescribe the meds that I need.
1016,"Last year I got married and when I did that, I lost my state health insurance and with that I lost my meds."
1017,So I've been on a rotten low swing for months despite my medication..
1018,"Dear bipolar,

I have been diagnosed with bipolar II recently, and this is me on the third month of meds."
1019,"Thank you guys for advices in my last post, and to keep faith in the meds."
1020,So I have been off psyche meds for a couple of months.
1021,"Today was the second day that I couldn't take my blood pressure medication(the only pill I still take) because I ran out right before a holiday abroad, and I haven't been eating, I have been very irritable, I have been talking a LOT(very passionately as well), my pulse is really high, and I've had a cold sweat here and there."
1022,So I have been off medication for over a week and am doing pretty well I have even been able to sleep the past 2 nights without any sleep medication which is huge.
1023,I've got 3 months of meds left.
1024,"Within the past few months, I have attempted suicide, been sent to a mental hospital, diagnosed with PTSD and Bipolar 2, sought therapy and proper medication, and am progressively doing my best to look up and move forward."
1025,"I am unfortunately without a job, and my husband and I have had to resort to moving in with my mother while I adjust to new medicines and go through the beginning stages of improving myself."
1026,"Mom told me that my mental disorder and medication is bullshit and I should just get over it, and I called her out on the fact that she battles her own demons."
1027,"She won't eat in front of people because she's obese and afraid of being mocked, she cries constantly and says she's a failure of a mom, and refuses to take her medicine because she so far into denial with her own issues."
1028,So he start to change my meds and again and again i asked what is wrong with me why aren't you diagnose me with something.
1029,He just said that there is something wrong with chemicals in my brain and i need to take meds for balancing.
1030,Honestly meds helped with almost everything.
1031,But it was because I've had strep throat and i'm on a bunch of meds.
1032,"She suggested that i should start to use medication, but my parents, who both are doctors adviced me not to."
1033,I’m currently back in therapy and my psy change my medications.
1034,"I told my doctor about my worries, he said he wishes he could tell me I will be OK, but the truth is he doesn't know, this illness of mine will forever have to be under surveillance to make sure medication is working, but there are no guarantees, that killed a little part of my hope."
1035,"I got married 6 months ago, almost got divorced, a couple of months ago I started seeing a doctor and taken medication, quit drinking."
1036,I was still taking my medications during this time but I had not been seeing a therapist and I guess my pdoc didn't know either because when a depressive episode happens I just really shut down and just disappear from the world.
1037,Plus trying new medications is a nightmare.
1038,end this take your fucking meds ouajk;flds;nlaf;n
1039,"I had been drinking *very* heavily on my meds, maybe that was the cause."
1040,"This, panic attacks, episodes, consequences for social and professional life, medication side-effects."
1041,But I'm getting new meds tomorrow and I'm starting to doubt whether I'm bipolar at all.
1042,"Hey guys, I was wondering how you wonderful people are dealing with your bipolarity and what, if any, medications you are on."
1043,"I've been on my meds for three years, and I don't know why this is happening...and I don't know if its gunna stop."
1044,My doctor says I'm maxed out on my current meds so he isn't sure what to do.
1045,"Started with being told I have a mood disorder in 2004 and got fed medicines (upto 12 to 14 in a day), did not seem to have much effect."
1046,I then shifted doctors and got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder through new tests and new medicines ensued.
1047,"Constantly cutting myself and overdosing to stop the pain in my head, I just continued to keep taking medicines and not going anywhere."
1048,"I just got my medication, and I am eager to see what life is like without a darkness over your head."
1049,I called my pharmacist who told me to stop taking the meds immediately and to call my psychiatrist.
1050,I'm currently not taking any medication but am back in a very dark place.
1051,"Hi All,

Being recently diagnosed Bipolar II, and going through the process of trying different medication cocktails, I'm in a tricky spot."
1052,"I can't tell if my meds are starting to work, or if I'm hypomanic."
1053,I was diagnosed my junior year of high school with Bipolar II and have worked through many different meds (and periods of no meds) and prior to this relationship thought I had a pretty good handle on it.
1054,I was referred to a psychiatrist who said I had a mood imbalance and put me on a vast array of meds.
1055,"She put me on Seroquel, but she's keeping me on 50 mg per day until I can see my psychiatrist to make sure my meds won't cocktail in a weird way and if Seroquel is the best course of action."
1056,It may take a while to find the right medication but it will be worth it and I have faith now.
1057,"I don't want to ask my parents for medication because they're already paying for my tuition, in addition to all my private acting/singing/dancing classes, and other stuff like games and clothes, but my mom doesn't want me getting a job, and she's talked about getting me a therapist because I've asked for one."
1058,When 6 months comes we will start weaning off my heart medication.
1059,"), spending sprees, abusing alcohol solely through self-medication and subsequently getting into legal trouble because of it."
1060,"He has never come out directly and said ""i'm manic depressive,"" but he has mentioned (when drunk once) seeing a therapist but deciding to come off meds about a year ago."
1061,The only meds that ever seemed to work were mood stabilizers.
1062,The meds have really leveled me out.
1063,I told my mom I wanted to quit my meds.
1064,"I know this could be due to not having the right mix of medicines down yet, but I read responses to a question about living with ADHD without medication out of curiosity and I finally felt a click."
1065,"Had my intake session now am awaiting an appointment with my case worker before I get to meet my real psychiatrist, begin psychotherapy and probably go on medications."
1066,Any guesses as to what line of meds to expect?
1067,I have a really big problem being comfortable with my medication and now I feel like I don't want to take my Ativan any more.
1068,"I've been having a tough time and I know I really need to take my medication, but now taking it is going to give me anxiety because of what she said."
1069,"I've tried many meds including antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers (seizure medication), but nothing has been able to get me out of this low."
1070,Lots of times people who are newly diagnosed or scared come on this and many other forums across the net asking for advice on what medicines to take.
1071,"But then other bipolar people who should know better jump in and start saying things like ""xyz medicine is horrible, don't ever take it!"""
1072,"or ""you MUST take xyz medicine."
1073,"I don't think there is a problem in just sharing what medicines we take, just that some of us act like our personal experience represents what's good for everyone."
1074,"We know that two people who seem very similar can have very different reactions to medication, and that giving advice like this should only be done by a doctor."
1075,I know this for a fact because I was scared to take a medicine after I saw a bunch of people on Reddit say it was bad.
1076,I feel stupid for being so certain I could manage without meds and now I really need them.
1077,I wouldn't have figured out that my meds weren't working well enough if I hadn't had my journal to keep record of the patterns in my moods and behaviors.
1078,"So I wouldn't have had this info to give to my pdoc, and he wouldn't have changed my meds accordingly."
1079,I already feel a little better knowing that my new meds might finally let me be free of symptoms.
1080,She suggested that I might need a medication change to maybe lamictal and to talk to my psychiatrist about it.
1081,"For people who have ever had a change in medication, are lamictal side effects different from lithium side effects?"
1082,"I'm on decent medication right now but I'm always scared of failure, of relapse, of not being able to get my shit together."
1083,I anticipated some side effects since I've never taken medication like this but is this something I can expect to pass?
1084,"I've been seeing a psychologist to help me get through all this (I have always been anxious but it has been ramped up this year, to say the least) and she recommended that I see a psychiatrist to manage my meds."
1085,I've only used medication for the first 2 months after my diagnosis.
1086,"I didn't want to take medication because I don't want to cover up symptoms, I want to find the problem."
1087,And I know medication just lessens the symptoms it doesn't make them go away entirely which also scares me.
1088,"I have mentioned difficulties losing weight while on seroquel, which she says can't be blamed on the medication because I needed to lose weight already."
1089,"When I was on lexapro and having trouble sleeping, she said it wasn't due to medication, and I ended up manic."
1090,I hate the way I feel on these medications and I'm just ready to give up again.
1091,Been taking my medication for about a year after I was hospitalized during a manic episode.
1092,Learning about my medications and how they work has been instrumental in dealing with my bipolar.
1093,"For one money, I have a distrust of people, and I am afraid of medicine."
1094,"For the past four years I have been taking bipolar medication, going to the university psychiatry clinic and seeing a therapist at the school's counseling center."
1095,"And with the prescribed medications, I'm usually pretty good about them, although even the Xanax became a problem at one point

But, I used to do LSD/Shrooms/2CE every week for a few months, have had a nasty Ritalin addiction, have gone through drinking binges and got hooked on Xanax on accident (had to take them to get through an episode, took more and more until I had withdrawls, learned a hard fucking lesson)."
1096,"Besides, seven of the nine patients were taking maintenance psychiatric medications for BD at the time of the apparent reaction."
1097,I've been on it for almost a month and like that there are less side effects than the other medications but I just don't feel happy.
1098,I take my medication everyday.
1099,"The medication you stabilised on, do you just take them indefinitely from here on out?"
1100,"Once she recovered from the breakdown and started seeing a therapist/taking meds, I stopped cleaning as often And asked her to help out."
1101,"During the OD, I took very large quantities of psychiatric medicine that caused the most horrifying experience of my life, it also caused me to have seizures."
1102,"I pay for the medication, but it's subsidised by the government so it's cheap."
1103,"I won't list off the dozen or so medications I've been on in the last year, but in addition to the expected side effects of any given drug (like drowsiness, lack of sex drive, hampered cognitive function, etc) I've had a few unusual symptoms crop up that I really can't attribute to anything else."
1104,"so my question is, does this resonate with anyone else's experience of medication?"
1105,"Those two events got me off meds altogether  although occasionally i go back on anti-anxiety pills, Valium for now."
1106,The medicine and just PTSD/bipolar/bpd got me all fucked up.
1107,That I'm NOT going to get to stop taking my meds...probably ever.
1108,The medication she takes restricts her episodes to occurring every few years and they change each time.
1109,My medications are finally leveling me out... yet tonight I'm having a painfully lonely night.
1110,I just don't what to do and my anxiety is crippling but meds have never really helped me
1111,"As long as I'm on my meds, I should be alright."
1112,Is there a way to manage this besides meds and mood tracking so it doesn't get out of control?
1113,"So, through a series of events including insurance issues and my own stubbornness, I was off my meds for a large part of September and October."
1114,"I know meds can seem ridiculous, especially if you are just coming to terms with a diagnosis, but trust me, meds are better than the alternative."
1115,"Thanks guys :)

Edit: Forgot to take my medicine today whoops!"
1116,I'm prescribed all these but I'm an addict as well not just addicted to the meds I'm on but... hard stuff Painkiller wise which I stopped awhile ago only to start suboxone which I can't shake now.
1117,"I know people often ask about other's experience with meds, both good and bad, so I thought I'd share mine."
1118,"I am on meds now that I take daily I have an alarm for it and everything, plus xanax for those moments where I start falling apart."
1119,People always ask how my meds affect me and I honestly have no idea outside of they seem to keep my mood flat.
1120,How do I learn to understand how my medicine affects me and if it's indeed the right medicine before me?
1121,"""It's all in your head man, you don't need that shit""
""Your meds are just big pharma trying to poison your mind: get off that shit, it's gonna kill your brain""
""Just smoke some pot, dude- it's nature's medicine""
""Stop taking that stuff, it makes you lose who you truly are."
1122,"The other night I made an ass of myself blowing up at a friend of a friend who came over to my house because he was trying to pull that shit on me, trying to tell me how to live my life, what makes me happy and unhappy, not knowing what I go through and what I'm like without medications."
1123,"The last time I was on medication for my BP2, I was taking Seroquel and Clonidine (which was for anxiety)."
1124,"**I was wondering what medications, if any, people have had success with for anxiety that is NOT a benzodiazepine?"
1125,"But I still feel like I'm lost and loose and not sure really what I can do, since I know that my current medication is not doing what it should and either needs to be increased or changed."
1126,(I have a high tolerance to medications and they stop working altogether after a while).
1127,Are there people who get on meds and are able to manage just fine?
1128,"I am very willing to see a psychiatrist and get on medication, I just don't want to have the negative effects of an anti-depressant again, which I really feel did not benefit me at all."
1129,His medication is not as well managed as mine.
1130,My meds (lamotrigine/citalopram/lorazepam) are not doing nearly enough yet.
1131,I'm a little nervous as the last go-round I had with this branch of medicine was as a teen and I don't remember much about what happens during first meetings.
1132,"I was on meds for ADHD, abused that, so no more ADHD meds, then had depression meds, and I hate depression meds, but recently I just get angry at the stupidest things, like when my girlfriend wanted a glass cup instead of a plastic cup (it started out as joking and then i got angry) so I want to go on a mood stabilizer but, I have not been on meds in forever."
1133,I'm going to do another questionnaire to see if meds are recommended for my level of symptoms.
1134,I'll admit that I'm the first one to admit that I use the medication as a crutch but I sincerely believe that I need to be on it... and to be honest that's *my* decision.
1135,"I definitely got lucky with medication, as Lamotrigine has been a miracle, but I think it made it easier to make an educated guess with my pdoc because of my symptoms."
1136,I finally went to see a psych doc instead of a nurse practitioner to adminster my meds after bad results and two very bad reactions (one to fluoxetine and one to Buspar).
1137,"I had been taking my meds regularly, and I was beginning to see some sort of stability in my life."
1138,"My two best friends are on similar psych meds and, they really have no tolerance for alcohol anymore."

1140,I just started taking it along with my regular medicine.
1141,About 2 months into it she confided in me that she suffers from bipolar but was not on medication.
1142,She is now with a great doctor and maintains her medication and things have gotten better.
1143,"So I can never figure out which problems are coming from me and which problems are medication related, but I seem to have issues with a lot of medications."
1144,I have already tried almost all my options and am close to giving up on meds.
1145,"To curve the magnitude of those curves, we take medication to slow things down."
1146,"I didn't get that much sleep today, and I can't believe how much lack of sleep and not having my meds for two days can affect me."
1147,I just wish I could be happy without meds.
1148,"She doesn't like therapy and meds and refuses to think anything is wrong, kind of just blames other people instead of her approach to them."
1149,"Therapy and medications are part of the current program, but don't seem to be enough."
1150,How have your meds changed your life?
1151,Funnily enough they don't give medication or intense psychiatric treatment to hormonal people.
1152,Apparently I'm more fun when I don't take my medicine.
1153,"That being said, I take my meds religiously or things spin out of control, and I believe I'm the second coming."
1154,"I'll xpost on /r/juicing as well, but wanted to see if any of you have considered or done a juice fast while on BP meds."
1155,"Currently, I take 1050 mg Lithium, 200 mg Lamictal, 12.5 mg Ambien CR + occassional 3 mg Melatonin as well as some other minor gastro meds and supplements, just to give an idea of what I'll need to manage."
1156,"I've done 3 day fasts before, but that isn't really enough time to impact my meds."
1157,"For the 10 day, though, I believe it will be more important to monitor closely, and perhaps make some accommodations for my meds, such as keeping salt in the diet (which is typically avoided during traditional juice fasts) and I'd love to know what others may have done during fasts."
1158,"It would be great to hear from anyone who has done one, especially on meds."
1159,"My pdoc and I will be discussing in depth at my appt next week, and she is very good at ordering a bounty of tests to make sure we have LOTS of data to help us monitor things, but not having done one on meds personally, I'd just like to cover my bases and gather ALL the data I can."
1160,":)

Tl;dr I'm currently on meds for BP and want to do a 10 day (or more) juice fast."
1161,I'm looking to hear about other folks' experiences with juicing while on BP meds.
1162,I just told my friends I'm on medication at the moment ( 2.5mg Abilify) and it feels better and I was wondering what you guys think?
1163,"I've been dealing with bipolar disorder for nearly 10+ years , normally the seas are calm and I can ""manage"" without the need of medication but these last few months I feel like i keep jumping all over the place to the point its affecting things greatly."
1164,"It sounds so stupid saying it out loud but I feel like if I start taking the meds then it's real, I am going to have to accept that I cant control my emotions and that feeling is awful."
1165,"I don't want to lose my job, I just want to ride it out until I'm on a therapeutic dose of meds again."
1166,While on the medication I have at times done occasionally well such as when I was on Zyprexa.
1167,"However, I have noticed some strange things while off the medication."
1168,"I have noticed that when I'm off medication people act differently towards me, more hostile or perhaps more aggressive."
1169,Is anyone studying at college or uni while taking these meds?
1170,All in all I rate the experience a 4/10 because I did learn some good coping skills and finally got my meds adjusted.
1171,"That ended so I moved home and started taking meds again, and I'm completely batshit."
1172,When I have it I'm usually ok as long as I have proper medicine.
1173,"people are without their medications that they need to function, it's so dangerous, wtf) and I'm pretty angry about it, but I digress."
1174,"During my last appointment, I explained that my anxiety has increased while taking the medicine."
1175,I'm now 31 and FINALLY back on meds and under regular psychiatric care after realizing once and for all that I can't manage my symptoms on my own.
1176,"I'm only on day 3 of my meds and the side effects are pretty brutal (jittery, pounding heart, racing thoughts, nausea, switching between insomnia and grogginess - called the doc and they told me it's normal but to call again if they get worse) but I know that once I get through the initial stages, and maybe even trying something different if these don't work, I'm going to be okay."
1177,"**tl;dr New here, finally on meds, glad to be part of the community**"
1178,"If you could share your experience, mention the state, and how you feel it is working in combination with/or comparison to other medication."
1179,I'm not on meds - I have a meeting with a psych.
1180,Since then I've had 2 severe manic episodes when  i went of medications in 2009.
1181,"About 3 months ago, she got started on lithium (she's also on lamictal and adderall and a few antipsychotics and antianxiety meds)..."
1182,I am currently in weekly therapy and am taking my meds as directed.
1183,And I try so hard to get rid of it with medicine and therapy.
1184,I met with a psychiatrist today who is letting me research medications and narrow down the ones that I'm interested in.
1185,I ran out of meds because I can't get to the doctor for the next few weeks and I fell right into bad derealization and depression and I know I'm fucked
1186,"I know there is a lot of ""you can't self diagnose"" ""go see a doctor"" feelings around here, but right now I just have one question which is: 

What worked (if anything) before meds/therapy?"
1187,"Listener 2 provided basic reminders about important things like therapy and medication, without giving advice."
1188,I know sshe's been off of her medication for about a year.
1189,"I hope the new meds help, but haven't had luck in the past."
1190,I stopped taking my medication about eight months ago and did fine for the first five months.
1191,My mood is stable thanks to the medications I'm on.
1192,"Thankfully nothing in my life is too messed up, but I knew it was time to switch meds."
1193,Bonus if your meds don't nix your sex drive!
1194,I don't want to be popping Tylenol every day just so I can take this medication.
1195,I'm already taking 3 medications for bipolar and anxiety including a mild anti-psychotic.
1196,"For some people, the mania is so amazing, that medication and therapy may not be worth it."
1197,"My journey through life has been crazy, but through therapy and medication, I am the most stable and the most consistently happy that I have ever been."
1198,"I've been on my medication, haven't missed any doses in months, my life couldn't be any more perfect than it is, I just can't for the life of me understand why I'm getting angry again."
1199,At this point she isn't taking her medicine and is not going to therapy.
1200,"Today I found out that she took 30 dollars from me, 15 from my mom, and has been stealing my brother's medicine."
1201,"Like, my medication doesn't make me happy."
1202,"I've never taken meds for it, I've been able to cope (somewhat fine) for over 5 years now without them and I really don't want to get on but I'm getting desperate."
1203,I accidentally missed my lithium dose a couple weekends ago and didn't get hungover when I definitely would've if I had taken the medicine.
1204,"And I know most people aren't able to still drink ""regularly"" on medication like I'm doing (I also know that my version of regularly is probably more than most)."
1205,I have no energy because of the meds.
1206,I've heard so much about the unavoidable weight gain from taking this medication.
1207,Has anyone experienced weight gain from low doses of meds (especially Seroquel)?
1208,Or does this only happen with larger doses of medication?
1209,So I decided to try clonazepam with my night time meds (Seroquel)... and now I'm missing a huge chunk of memory.
1210,Its been 8 years since i was on any type of medication for bipolar (cyclothymia) I had a really bad experience with depakote and seraquel.
1211,"My concern however, is that it could be a reason to terminate me very quickly if it comes to light for whatever reason, be it having to take a day because I'm having an episode, or being seen taking my meds at my desk."
1212,I see my therapist almost every week (she's great) and FINALLY found a decent medication combo that works even though some of the side effects still suck.
1213,"The ups and downs drive me nuts, even with the good application of meds."
1214,Neither one of us take medication besides medical marijuana and that seems to work for the most part.
1215,Can I trust myself to make sound decisions if I don't take medication?
1216,She had a depression last december and took medication for that.
1217,"Will she realize her ""mistakes"" when she will start lithium medication?"
1218,"Have a migraine, stay home to take medication and sleep it off - I have to somehow find a Dr. willing to sign a note."
1219,"Major depressive episode where I feel like cutting myself, stay home to take medication and sleep it off, but again will have to get a Dr.'s note before I can come back."
1220,"Anxiety flaring up and I'm heading for a massive panic attack, stay home to take medication and sleep it off, still have to find a Dr. willing to sign a document saying they have cleared be to come back to work."
1221,"This is all very very very new to me, (diagnosed feb 2014) so I need a little guidance on whether or not there are ways (on top of medication) to help slow the shifts."
1222,Do i go two days without meds and keep my fingers crossed?
1223,"I am on medications and in therapy, but I truly scare myself at times like these."
1224,"About a month ago, I was put back on medication because I felt myself edging on hypomania and friends had expressed concern."
1225,"Initially, things seemed to be okay, but as I've continued taking the medication- even with the increased dose of Lamictal- I have begun to spiral out of control."
1226,"Update: My medication has been updated, but I'd still appreciate any and all other coping strategies you've got to offer."
1227,He isn't interested in therapy again but is on medication.
1228,Is suggesting changing meds a good option or what other ways do you deal with a storm when it's brewing.
1229,"After a long journey of self discovery, including missing for days, hospitalization, compulsion, scratching, miscarrying, stripping, sex, drugs, meditation, and medication, I still struggle with Ambiso on a daily basis."
1230,"So I've decided to back on meds, but not back to any of the doctors I've seen in the past."
1231,I ran out of medication and I've come way back down really quickly.
1232,"Before now I've been pretty damn stable for at least a year, maybe two, thanks to finally figuring out my perfect medication combo (Lamictal and Wellbutrin SR if that matters)."
1233,I feel like the weed might be counteracting the effects of my medication though?
1234,"She went on ton of meds, almost offed herself."
1235,"And she sits on a high horse, so the idea that someone else (especially western medicine) helping her is ludicrous."
1236,"I'm on better medication and doing better these days but these events absolutely haunt me, they keep me up at night and make me cringe with embarresment all day literally years after it happened."
1237,"Hi guys

So, I posted yesterday saying that I was feeling pretty shitty cus I ran out of meds."
1238,I religiously take my meds and am very careful of my thought patterns as much as possible.
1239,"As some of my eating is due to my meds, while others was once an addiction to starch, salt, sugar, etc."
1240,Is this one of the reasons that some (including myself at times) have a hard time with treatment and medication?
1241,I asked him if we could add Adderall or Wellbutrin to make me feel alive again but he said that could induce cycling and make the medications I'm on quit working.
1242,I told him I felt good on those medications before and he said I was probably hypomanic.
1243,I want to change my medications somewhat.
1244,"I have tried 8 different types of medications over the years, none of them have worked..."
1245,I stopped seeking medical help...most psychiatrist made contracts with pharmaceutical companies so they want  me to keep trying more medication.
1246,"I AM DONE, have been on antidepressants combined with antipsychotics, and anti anxiety meds, and adderal for my ADD,  sleeping meds."
1247,"Almost two years and I'm still trying to get my meds where they need to be because my symptoms are getting worse so we have to keep trying new things that may work for me, I didn't have insurance before Obama Care kicked in so I couldn't afford medication when I left my Job that gave me insurance, I was off my meds for almost a year, I actually don't remember what happened much of that year but thank god the Government pays for my medications now."
1248,I was less than diligent about taking my meds over the weekend and now I'm paying the price i guess.
1249,"They gave me names of therapists and meds and stuff, it just seemed way out of line."
1250,I am just wondering if anyone has been able to remain stable without medication.
1251,I feel like an outsider in my own mind and life all the time and while medication stops my depression and mania I feel it numbs me.
1252,"He was diagnosed ~8 years ago, we've been though a lot- hospitalizations, more meds/pdocs than I can list, ECT, financial crises after hypomanic spending sprees, suicide watches, you name it."
1253,Went on meds.
1254,Came off meds (Lexapro and Effexor).
1255,For starters he can barely hold a full conversation; his meds make his memory shit and he forgets what he's saying halfway through a sentence.
1256,Maybe he's taking TOO many meds?
1257,"I am being evicted, lost my job last week because I could not leave my apartment and have yet to recieve any meds."
1258,"So I am suicidal, no meds for a month at least and homeless in three days."
1259,"Sadie turned to me and asked ""Are you on meds?"""
1260,"She put her hand on her shoulder, looked me in the eye and said ""Please don't ever stop taking your meds, I don't want to stop being your friend."""
1261,"Plus I was kind of in denial for a very long while about meds and I had this ""i'm not fucking ill, if other people dont take things to just stop being 'sad' then I can too""."
1262,"Around a year ago I lost my insurance, and had to stop taking my medicine."
1263,I believe (my layperson's opinion) that B is BP or has a BPD and that B needs to be on medication.

1265,I had a tooth pulled two days ago so I'm on 325mg of Hydros (pain meds) for several days.
1266,"I'm looking for some advice on getting medication, quickly."
1267,Probably just going to take extra meds and go the fuck to bed.
1268,"I've read in a few forum posts that zinc can be used to counter the effects that meds have on libido, but not from anybody that actually used it."
1269,"Before the meds, we both had similar libidos, but since she started them, hers has slowly dwindled over the years."
1270,We have talked at length about this and I understand the effects that the meds have had.
1271,"She still finds me sexy and the desire is still there, but the energy to go after that has been suppressed by the meds."
1272,"My therapist did not have the credential to prescribe medication, so he referred me to someone that could."
1273,"I talked to my primary care provider, and he said he could prescribe me medication, but needed my mental exam from my therapist before, to make sure there was not a mistake."
1274,"I've just run out of my meds and am pretty rocky, I'll be working constantly over the next week so will have no time to go to a doctor."
1275,"i've been on so many meds for a long time, numbing antidepressants, brain numbing soul destorying antipsychotics (notably clozaril) that i worry my ability to function as a human being with purpose and drive and intelligence has been completely destroyed."
1276,"I'm finally feeling better psych meds wise, but I have a history of self destructive behavior."
1277,"Final concern:  I'd love to talk to my doctors about my current worries of addiction, but I'm terrified they would take me off some of my meds (like benzos), due to an increased risk of complications."
1278,"Yes I  was smoking crazy amounts of pot, and now that I'm out I really, really want to grab some more... but my medication works."
1279,"It took me over 10 years to get the correct diagnosis and medication, I don't want to fuck that up."
1280,I've done my best to stay away from any mood altering medication that doctors recommend to me.
1281,Medical marijuana seems to be the only medicine that can undoubtedly relieve my symptoms.
1282,"My doctor gave me a list of bi polar meds that he recommend they are the following
 
Lamictal, Depakote, Trileptal, Lithium, Abilify, Risperdal, Geodon, and Latvda

Out these which one do you guys think is the best or helps the most based off personal experience."
1283,Please let me know or suggest any other types of meds or solutions to help me through this.
1284,"I know what you guys are going to say: ""Dont do it,"" ""call your PDoc,"" ""take your meds,"" etc."
1285,"She had a lifetime of dealing with her mother and her condition/medication and the ups and downs it brought (I don't remember what it actually was), and as little as she thought she knew me at times, she knew more than anyone else ever did."
1286,"My psychiatrist is thinking of changing all of my medicines, which I really don't want to since my body is already adjusted to the medicines I am on."
1287,"Long story short, I've been diagnosed recently, but I'm still waiting for my psychiatry apt and haven't gotten any meds yet."
1288,"I'm getting out of control, the medications are not helping (lamictal &amp; seroquel)."
1289,"Just a little post for myself... :) 

The side effects that come with medication have finally relaxed, and I've been feeling really fucking good all day."
1290,"This past semester, there was a pharmaceutical mix up and I was without meds for four weeks, which caused me to withdraw for the semester."
1291,I have just come out of a long dark depression and changed my meds yet again.
1292,"I've been on medication for a while now and I thought I was getting it back, then this happens."
1293,"TL;DR, I'm bipolar and scared of the world and I can't work and I can't afford my meds...any ideas?"
1294,"I do everything my doc tells me, take all meds as prescribed, exercise, give myself quiet time."
1295,"Like, pre-medication deep."
1296,"I think we get depressed because we are smart enough to see how pointless this is, and I think we get manic because our minds are smart enough to trick us into thinking it's not pointless...

Every bipolar patient I meet that is on meds, or lithium, or has been through ECT seems distant, not really there, as zombie as the rest of the idiots."
1297,"I've noticed over the last few years most bipolars I meet know who michiu Kiaku is, they understand quantum mechanics a million times better than laymen, I meet the parents of bipolar kids that have NO IDEA what meds their kid is even on, and if I ask them about bipolar and topics they should have researched seeing as how their kid has it, and they don't know crap."
1298,You need to be on meds.
1299,I took medication from age 14 to 22. the medication robbed my life.
1300,I refuse to ever go on medicine again.
1301,I have been managing for the past 2 years without medication (I've been using more natural treatments such as supplements paired with excersize and regulating my sleep) and it has been pretty good.
1302,"I'm curious as to what other redditors experiences getting off of Seroquel have been like, I've never done this before and my shrink and I are hoping that this will work, but it's been torture trying to get off of this god awful, over prescribed medication."
1303,"Because believe me, I NEED medication for this."
1304,"If I can't get meds, and I can't have a legitimate psychologist to talk to --- why the hell should I bother spending the time and money there?"
1305,"I don't intend to stop taking my meds if I give this a short term (3-5 day) trial but if long term this ends up being something that could lower my doses/ amounts of drugs, I feel like that would be really worth it."
1306,"As of now I'm on Lamictal 100 mg, and beginning next week I will be upped to 200 mg. Today was actually my first time seeing a psychologist, instead of the usual psychiatrist, which isn't more than 15 minutes of updating him my reactions to the meds."
1307,"I started meds, was out of work for almost a year, and ended up leaving that job."
1308,"I then was on my mom's health insurance for a bit, then aged out, and couldn't afford meds or doctor visits."

1310,"My self perception is very distorted and I said some nasty angry things.,The medication is not working at all, and I will stop it."
1311,Has anyone else ever dealt with similar side effects to this medication?
1312,The timing and the medication roulette could not be more awful.
1313,"I struggle with suicidal thoughts ALOT, I feel worthless, a burden to other people, waste of space shit like that the meds help and I'm back in therapy but the thoughts never seem to go away."
1314,"This subreddit is also pro choice when it comes to self managing (counselling, behavioural therapy etc), traditional medication (anti-depressants, anti-psychotics etc) as well as alternate medicine (dietary supplementation/modification etc) as treatment."
1315,"It is widely accepted that certain people can and do manage their symptoms without the aid of medication however, this is not for everybody and that's OK too."
1316,"Sadly I couldn't fill them for about a week, but now that I'm a few weeks in I think I finally may have found my combo, which is amazing cause I lost count after a dozen different meds and this is try 3 for both, though first time together."
1317,As the weeks passed the meds really started helping and leveling me out.
1318,"tl;dr got hit by a train, meds started to work, so I’m following my dreams"
1319,"When I first started my new meds, I began a new job as a PharmTech which includes long, late hours."
1320,"No I'm not glad I am ""sick"" with BiPD, I'm glad I am physically getting sick into a toilet every few minutes because that means my body is acclimating to my new medication."
1321,"This part of new medication sucks - many of you know exactly how nasty some initial and long term side effects are - some have never been fully informed of what they may experience because ""may cause nausea"" written in size 10 font on the label doesn't prepare you to wake up in cold sweats heaving into a trash can at 2 AM."
1322,That's why a lot of new patients stop taking their meds - they don't want to cope with the side effects.
1323,And yes some of the side effects just fucking suck but you need to gauge how uncomfortable you are now vs. what that medication will do for you in the long run.
1324,"I've personally been on this medication before so I **know** the benefits outweigh the side effects, which is why I'm glad I'm getting this nausea crap out of the way now."
1325,But I have been through many meds that I had no clue if they were worth it or not.
1326,The point is you have to really put forth a lot of effort sometimes to get the benefit - That medication could significantly improve the quality of your life.
1327,This post was mainly for people that are newly diagnosed and those who have given up on their meds before solely because of side effects.
1328,He adjusted my meds which give me a little hope but I can't take this anymore.
1329,"I also set all six alarms for eating, meds, waking and sleeping, etc."
1330,"I've tried to look this up online, but all of the results I found had to do with side effects of meds, and I've been off my meds for several months now."
1331,"I've been on lamictal and saw a post earlier today about feeling 'slow,' while on this medication, and that's exactly how I've felt since I've started taking it."
1332,"Also, I am super anxious about this medicine but pretty excited to have these waves of emotions go away."
1333,I haven't started taking the meds because I'm afraid - both afraid that he's right and afraid that he's wrong.
1334,"I have been on anti depressants but not bipolar medication, what is the difference?"
1335,It's becoming more common now that I'm on meds but I am so not upset about it.
1336,"as a medicine, for anxieties specific and general, it works great."
1337,After I got out of the hospital I felt really awesome glad to be home and the medications they gave me seamed to be working (zyprexa=mood stabilizer; zoloft=antidepressants).
1338,(Yes I am taking medication).
1339,"So with all that said, for those who found a compatible cocktail of medication, tell me, in detail, how does it feel?"
1340,My wife insisted many years ago that I go see someone who of course started me on meds.
1341,"But, I'll be damned if these meds are doing a fucking thing except excacerbating the problem or worse doing things unknown until the future."
1342,Has anyone gone completely naked drug wise after a long time of being on meds and had success?
1343,Well my migraines which I finally got under control with preventative medication were out of control.
1344,She put me on the lower dose again and added Wellbutrin well due to circumstances I couldn't get the medicine.
1345,I finally admitted I hadn't slept in three days and I been off my meds for a week.
1346,They gave me permission to take a sleep aid Friday night and they made me make sure I had a way to get my meds before I left the program.
1347,We have done the medication and therapy circus.
1348,"It took a while to get it out of my system and feel ""normal"" again but after that I was afraid of medication."
1349,I get my medications through a large retail pharmacy chain (Walgreens).
1350,"I find this a really unethical and disgusting practice, and it pisses me the fuck off, because OBVIOUSLY now this company has my name in their files, tagged as (at the very least) using medication to treat depression."
1351,She has never been on medication for it (though she has self-medicated with alcohol and pot/drugs continually since then).
1352,"I thought I should share it with /r/bipolar since the posts here tend to be from people in times of crisis, and I thought it would be a good change of pace to submit while I'm level-headed, doing well on meds and couldn't be happier."
1353,"I'm on the best medication regime I've ever had - just one med, but it's very effective and has almost no side effects for me."
1354,I have bipolar 1 and take my medications as prescribed.
1355,Sometimes it makes me want to quit my medicine because at least when I am manic I don't have an urge to binge eat.
1356,"I know part of the increased appetite is due to one of my medications, but it works well and I can't blame binge eating on a medication."
1357,My worst fear is that my medicine is going to stop working.
1358,Is this because of changes in medication.
1359,So I'm trying to get back on meds.
1360,I got a call from the county today who is supposed to help me get on meds long term.
1361,"Because of issues with medication, I've been rapid cycling for a week or two."
1362,"As an aside - I am going to see a doctor again soon to get evaluated and possibly get on medication, since the mood swings and psychosis are really impacting my ability to cope and work."
1363,This is going to clash with being put back on meds and I am afraid for that reason.
1364,Can't throw up because I just took my meds before running.
1365,so should I up my dose of meds to knock it out or just keep the thoughts to myself?
1366,"If this is what I'm still drawn to even being on 4 meds, I feel like there's no hope for my cognition to ever be truly ""normal""."
1367,"I've never been an alcoholic but have always enjoyed alcohol and have always had a few beers in the fridge to unwind with after work most days but have stopped drinking completely since becoming medicated (Quetiapine), mainly because of how it interacts with and potentiates the meds effects a lot."
1368,"Geodon withdrawal is like nothing I've ever experienced before, and I've taken many medications."
1369,"I'd like to ask you guys about what the differences are between these drugs, and whether she should give up the free therapy and a doctor who seems to really care about her to get medicine that she might need."
1370,I figured this would have stopped as soon as I stopped taking meds.
1371,"* While it probably won't kill you to take it with other medications, if you are on pot while testing legitimate medicine to see if it will help you, it can skew the results."
1372,"It can take years to find the right med combo, and if you use pot and your doctor doesn't know, you very well could wind up thinking your medicines don't work when they do, or do work when they don't, potentially prolonging your agony for years."
1373,"Over the years I have combated this issue with all that I could, using cognitive therapy and medication in tandem  to fight against the invisible force that would hold me hostage in my home."
1374,She is now diagnosed as bipolar 2 and on psych meds for it (was never diagnosed before and just self medicated).
1375,We decide to give it another chance now with her psych meds and the knowledge that we cannot have any of the drugs she tends to abuse if she wants to be with me (xanax and pain pills).
1376,She is doing much better on psych meds and in better mood overall.
1377,So I asked the receptionist to get him to call me back because I need to know what to do about my meds.
1378,I want to preface this and say that I REALLY don't like any medicine and I am a strong skeptic to the fact that I have Bipolar.
1379,I have never been diagnosed concretely with Bipolar which is why I want to try life without medication.
1380,"Also, I'm 20 and don't want to be taking meds for the next 60 years."
1381,I've never met with a good doctor as I was treated initially at a state clinic (essentially a cattle drive where they throw medication at you) and now I am at my school clinic.
1382,"I want to go off meds completely and see if I can be normal again but everyone and their mother says that's a bad idea without giving a solid, sensible reason aside from ""bad things happen when other people do it""

**TL;DR I want off medication."
1383,What are your experiences with stopping meds?
1384,"I've been trying to find the right medication combo for... seven years, this August."
1385,"I have been on several medications off and on (some I've tried more than once, some only the one time to see how they went) and now my psychiatrist and I have decided to try Lithium."
1386,I've tried every reasonable combination of medications.
1387,"I also take medication for my anxiety (Lorazepam), insomnia (Ambien - had to stop taking that one, though) and have been off and on some medications for my OCD and depression."
1388,"Worst I've felt in a long time, probably since my meds started working."
1389,Had a few offers for things to go to but so pumped up on new meds that have no desire to go to socially intense situations.
1390,"I'm having a great time reading on my own, mildly spaced out on new meds."
1391,"*

**Problem: I keep going off my meds**

*Pharma/therapy solution: my head shrinker is very good: he knows the comfort I take in dry, clinical analysis of my internal weather/vicissitudes, and does very little Papa-Bear-ing."
1392,"If I had a pet Weggooibaar, I would make sure it took its meds and ate properly, because I love and take care of my pets."
1393,She told me they have her on a new medication and she feels much better.
1394,"I need to vent, so this might be kind of long, but I'm not really expecting anyone to read it :/

I've been diagnosed bipolar for over 6 years now, and I've been on medication for just as long."
1395,Hopefully going to be requesting a new medication to try and help with the depressive and psychotic symptoms more than the manic or hypermanic.
1396,This is also the longest I have ever stayed on meds.
1397,"What is this medication  
Why does it hold me back?"
1398,"I was wondering, am I supposed to take my medicine before I go to get the test, or should I wait till after I'm done to take it."
1399,I was diagnosed at 15 and I've been on and off various meds since.
1400,"I'm going back to therapy (on a regular scheduled basis type thing) even though I have a hard time being honest with her (or any therapist for that matter), and I'm on my medication on the dose I'm prescribed."
1401,They tell me to stick with my meds and get through it.
1402,"I recently opened up to my family about my ""anxiety"" problem that's making me take medicine."
1403,I listed the amount of meds I'm taking and they want me off everything because they don't think theres anything wrong with me.
1404,"But anyway, here are my meds, can you guys tell me if you think I should see a difference in my mood if I am actually bipolar?"
1405,"One question:
-IF someone was set off with Mania when they were prescribed anti-anxiety (SNRI) medication is that indicative of Bipolar?"
1406,I know it's not my other meds because I've been on them before.
1407,It has been over a month and I haven't taken any of my meds.
1408,"If you wait, what happens when they come back to the apartment and see the meds on the counter?"
1409,I eventually told her to go fuck herself and then went without meds for about 6 months when my roommate ( a doctor) had me committed on her orders.
1410,"She tells me I'm not actually bipolar, that I just went to my psychiatrist and TOLD him I was bipolar and he said ""ok"" and gave me the meds for it."
1411,"Anyway, the reason why I'm creating a support group is because I'm losing my artistic integrity and am stopping the medication."
1412,Can I really trust the OBGYN to understand how the pill will affect my psychiatric meds?
1413,"I'm not one to just cease taking medications on my own, this was my psychiatrist's fault as she did not answer several of my texts and calls that I needed a refill ASAP."
1414,"But why can't a psychologist in the hospital check you out first, check your meds, and just send you to nicer place?"
1415,"It was my first experience being on a mood-management medication, but I'd been working with therapists and psychologists off and on for the last five or so years."
1416,"This year, the clinic I was going to dropped my care (maybe because I demanded they mail me medication because I tried picking it up on a day they were closed, then tried demanding gas money, then I proceeded to tell this secretary of a christian non-profit ever fallacy in their operations.)"
1417,"But on the other hand, I may try to change my meds."
1418,"I guess what I'm wondering is what does ""working medication"" look like?"
1419,"Thanks to your advice I started seeing a psychiatrist and we decided for me to start taking meds (something I was reluctant to do), I am on Nozinan (apparently an ""old fashioned"" medicine that my doctor mainly prescribed because I was really scared of medication and that it had the advantage to exist in the form of drops to take with a bit of water.)."
1420,"I'm thinking about asking him for a medication that would help with my depressed state, because I've been unable to motivate myself to do anything and have been feeling at points incredibly (and for lack of a proper word) sad to the point of regularly considering suicide."
1421,"But I'm not sure anything can help, I'm wondering if it's not just that I am too weak and that my family situation isn't at its best (my mother is moving to another country for an unknown and extended period of time and it makes me really, really sad, so that might not help ; my boyfriend and I broke up as I was feeling quite numbed by the medication about a month ago and now I'm left kind of alone, etc)

Anyway, just wanted to keep you guys updated, and if any of you has advices about medication (or has taken Nozinan in the past - I haven't found it in the Master List) everything is welcome."
1422,"I've been off my meds for a little while, and I'm not doing great."
1423,"I don't want my life anymore, so I probably won't go back on my meds."
1424,"I have no idea what to do at the moment, I stopped taking my medication because the effort to get up and eat enough food to keep it from making me sick is too much."
1425,"When i thought i was just depressed (which i know think was just a really long episode), i told my parents i needed help and they refused to put me on medication."
1426,"I don't want to be perceived as needy or manipulative or anything like that but as soon as I got back to my dorm after I w as discharged from IOP, I decided to get drunk and the doctor was just telling me I can't drink and can't skip my meds, and that skipping meds doesn't make it ok to drink but here I am, stressed an drunK (less stressed now though that I am drunk) idk what to do."
1427,"Any time I start talking about how the meds have helped me she looks at me like I'm a drug addict, not like I'm someone with an illness."
1428,"She has always had this problem with any kind of medication - when I got my wisdom teeth out, she stopped letting me take my Percocet because I told her I liked it."
1429,"My dad has very little to say about medication, other than ""I wouldn't like to be on meds that make me feel foggy."""
1430,"Long story short, most of the people with any kind of authority or influence over me and my life are constantly encouraging me to stop taking medication."
1431,"Being on meds means I cannot fly airplanes, which is something my family is really into (My dad and brother are both pilots and I've had my pilot's license since I was 17), and so I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place."
1432,I can't fly while on meds that make me feel like a normal human being and I SHOULDN'T fly while not taking meds because I am suicidal almost daily under those circumstances.
1433,"The first person I really told was a recent boyfriend who wasn't surprised at all, he was first diagnosed with depression but he's been getting more and more manic episodes since he started taking medication (the school psychiatrist had him stop the meds when they found out, but the manic episodes are still more frequent)  so we're learning on being bipolar as well."
1434,"Everything that seems to go wrong with me seems to be a side effect of these fucking meds and then when I go to the doctor about it, he's just like.... well, here take something else."
1435,"My psychiatrist tells me that these are side effects of my meds and that Im just going to have to deal with them but here, take a prescription for Klonopin in case it gets real bad again."
1436,Turns out that my meds are messing with my eyesight and that I need FUCKING BIFOCALS.
1437,Wondering if there are any people out there with bipolar disorder that have digestion problems (that may or may not be caused by medication).
1438,"I have bipolar 2 and I usually keep it under control very well (taking my meds religiously, good sleep and exercise habits, etc.)."
1439,I gained 50lbs and slept all the time after I started bipolar meds and went through a mourning phase.
1440,I'm relieved as my meds have been adjusted and I feel stable but I'm dreading the day I have another episode.
1441,Sometimes (all too often) doctors don't believe symptoms are from meds.
1442,I know that no one can give medical advice here but just wondering about what a manic phase is opposed to medicine side effects?
1443,She also said that ups and downs such as racing thoughts should be dealt with since they pass and should not be an indicator for more medicine.
1444,"I'm also wondering if anyone has had any improvement with the side effects of their meds after trying Yoga, as well."
1445,"As I said, it's been a year since my diagnosis and I've been trying many different medications."
1446,"My psychiatrist gave me many kinds of meds to help me relax/sleep and none of them seemed to work except for seroquel, which made me feel like a zombie the whole next day, so that wasn't a real choice."
1447,We pretty much gave up on finding another medication.
1448,saw a new doctor yesterday after a few months and he has stopped my normal meds and has started me on a new drug the new drug is worse then anything ive ever had and hes trying to replace my 3 different drugs with one drug he hopes will work.
1449,was in hospital for it as i dont handle bloods well (its a trigger and i have to be drugged out for it) im not coping and hes claiming i need to wait 3 months for my long acting meds to leave the blood stream before we can even start to know if its working.
1450,"vitamin d and iron replacements and testosterone shots


he stopped all my meds 2 days ago."
1451,ive got no meds and going off all my normal meds all at the same time and starting a new med is killing me.
1452,I've been going through a bunch of medication changes so I was writing these episodes off to that but it's becoming more obvious that it's a reoccurring thing during certain times of the month.
1453,I'm pretty sure I've discontinued a few medications that were actually working pretty well because I assumed that they were causing it.
1454,I have done therapy and am on my meds.
1455,I need to take my medication.
1456,Psych: take meds Me: I can't.
1457,"I kept having the same panic attacks I've been having since 7 throughout all of this, and was finally given medication for it and diagnosed with panic disorder."
1458,"They had accepted that I was sick and that I needed help, and I got a therapist outside of Rutgers and was able to be prescribed all the medication I needed."
1459,I took my meds par the usual.
1460,"I didn't fall asleep immediately, so I asked my SO for a Sonata (I have designated him keeper of the sleepy meds)."
1461,My Husband is starting to feel like our lives are so focused on my medication and therapy that it's making him sad.
1462,Why do us bipolar people take a mixture of different meds?
1463,Why don't we just find the one right medication and stick with it?
1464,"Yes, we have tried medication, but he really didn't bother taking it."
1465,Got put on some medication.
1466,"Even though it hasn't been a week, the medication is working since now I can fall asleep before 12 but I seem to alternate between feeling normal, calm, somewhat cheerful and an intense feeling that I don't know how to describe it."
1467,I used to rely on having 2-3 beers daily but I can't anymore since I'm taking medication.
1468,"I'm sorry if these seems gloaty or in your face, that is definitely not my intention, it's just that I'm not on medication and do not actively go to therapy so this is a huge success for me and I feel really good about it :)"
1469,"We've been doing well lately with a couple small exceptions, despite the fact that I've been miserably rapid cycling for close to a month now (uninsured, waiting on treatment, no meds)."
1470,The moral of my story...is I thought it was the medicine to blame.
1471,"He started me off with a smaller dose of Seroquel, but after I told him about punching a hole in my bathroom wall during a fit of anger, he recommended I commit myself to a psych ward so he could observe me under a new, higher dose of medications."
1472,"The reality is that nobody can diagnose someone through a post on the internet, regardless of a background in psychology or medicine."
1473,"For instance, his best friend won't have anything to do with me any more because at christmas my meds stopped working and I had a serious rapid cycling moment, so now he just thinks I'm 'crazy'."
1474,"And how can I explain a rapid cycling episode brought about by medication not working to someone who has no experience of anyone with psychological problems, who just wants to brand me as 'crazy'?"
1475,"Have any meds been successful at getting you out of the ""dreamlike"" state of depression?"
1476,I'm going to ask for new meds and need some ideas.
1477,"I've been diagnosed for about 3 months, but never got in to get my medicine because of a move across country."
1478,Started lowering my dosage down to do a med change and I'm now changed over to some new meds.
1479,The drugs I'm on aren't enough and I don't have a place to go right now to try to get meds adjusted.
1480,"Frustrated about still being depressed despite things being great, frustrated about not being able to even try to change my meds again."
1481,"](/spoiler)

I'm calling my psychiatrist tomorrow to see if there's anything that we can do to change my medication."
1482,He promised that things were going to be different this time once he will be put on medication and start taking care of his mental illness by regularly seeing a psychiatrist and stop drinking.
1483,"it feels like medication does this all the time, is my body building some immune system after a while or wtf?!"
1484,Is it worth trying different meds?
1485,The lithium is the first medication that has really helped me get out of my slump a bit.
1486,One medication at a time.
1487,Therapy and medicine failed me.
1488,"When you enter meds in the app, they ask you to ""check off those you took today""."
1489,Most psychiatrists will help you/alter your medication right over the phone.
1490,All of my medication combos have left me severely depressed.
1491,"Last Tuesday, I stopped taking the medication after speaking with my doctor and these feelings have lessened in their frequency and intensity, but are sometimes still lingering, but I can still not really feel very much."
1492,My therapist actually suggested I talk to my pdoc about meds that work during the day and wear off quickly so I can be weirdly creative at home.
1493,Is anyone on meds that wear off quickly?/how is your experience with that?
1494,"My shrink had to write a letter to her explaining how important it is that I get the money for my medications on time because I can’t just go off of drugs like Lexapro, Lamictal, and Lithium for a week at a time out of the blue."
1495,"So when she ignored me yet again today, I sent her a text telling her that all I did was ask her for the money to get medicine, I had offered to send her the receipts and I had told her in my texts exactly what I was buying and how much it cost along with why I needed it; I asked her why she was ignoring me again, told her the passive aggressive behavior wasn’t fair and that since I didn’t even know what I did wrong, it was very ineffective at teaching me a lesson."
1496,"I texted her the day she went into the hospital asking if she could go to the bank and put money in my account so I could get my non-prescription meds for the month (I have a vitamin D deficiency, etc) and she didn’t answer."
1497,"When I woke up this afternoon (was manic previously, finally slept) I saw she hadn’t texted me yet, so I sent her a message telling her that I would really appreciate it if she could let me know if/when she would be able to go to my bank because I needed those medications."
1498,"Those “nasty text messages” were the messages asking for money for the OTC medications yesterday (when she was apparently already in the hospital), and today’s messages asking her to let me know when/if she was going to the bank and to stop being so passive aggressive."
1499,"I know that this sort of indecision on the doctor’s part seems ridiculous, because it is, but Mary has been adamant that her family doc knows what to do about her meds."
1500,"I told her I would leave unless she took her meds regularly, and she has done so but started wavering again."
1501,"I’ve faced some medical troubles of my own, and I’ve always had run-of-the-mill anxiety, but the combination of her anger and my recent illness have exacerbated my anxiety to the point where I’m getting weekly CBT and neuro meds."
1502,"Her doc is very reticent to relinquish authority over psych meds, even though she’s roundabout talking about conferring with a pdoc; moreover, her doc moves like molasses and never follows up when she says she will."
1503,I am frustrated at having to take medication.
1504,"After 12 years of medication I've noticed a few symptoms:


1) I'm incredibly jumpy - always moving from one conversation topic to the next without much leeway or consistency

2) Experience periods of mania where I'm initially very talkative, happy, euphoric, grandiose but experience the crash where I feel very quiet, withdrawn, fucking hell, get away from me, dear goodness if you try to text me I'm going to blow a gasket

2) I rarely talk or socialize with anyone (not even my family) 

3) I hate everything

4) I always feel on edge

5) I have trouble concentrating on a task



When I'm not on the medication:

1) I have this ""get away from me"" vibe 

2) I don't enjoy anything 

3) I can't stay on task 

4) I have this feeling in my mind as though I'm always distracted

5) I can never achieve a ""flow"" state

6) I have shitty verbal communication (as in, I can't communicate)

7) I feel anhedonic

8) People have told me that I seem ""flat"", ""stagnant"", ""boring"", ""non-animated"", ""not myself""

9) I FEEL flat

10) Lazy, low energy, unmotivated

11) Poor metabolism





Social consequences:


1) I have trouble settling in anywhere

2) I sabotage my performance at work if I know I'm not going to fit in there or the time I'm going to spend there is finite

3) I don't have a boyfriend (no shit)

I'm frustrated because although I appear ""functional"" to some degree, I don't feel that way at all."
1505,I've spent the formative years of my life on the medication and I'm feeling very reluctant to spend the summative years of my life in the same way.
1506,tl; dr the two main med adjustment choices in front of me right now make it so I either can't play trombone at night anymore and/or I might not be able to do my job during our busiest time of the year -- also my uterus is a little bitch and doctors won't order me the only kind of birth control that works with my meds.
1507,"Bipolar II here, and am in bit of a rough spot, a lot has gone wrong recently and I just need some tips on what other people do to stay calm (other than meds) because I feel something big coming on, either depressive or hypomanic, I can't tell yet."
1508,I'm currently not on any meds.
1509,I currently have neither and am getting my meds refilled by my primary and don't know when i'll be able to get professional help.
1510,"I've experienced several of the chemical induced lobotomies that arise from meds, suffering from every side effect from every label."
1511,"I guess I should try to convince my psych to let me switch meds but she's really adamant that unless the side effects are, like, TERRIBLE, I should stick with it since it's technically doing its job."
1512,"or ""My meds are finally working!"""
1513,"Yeah, it absolutely sucks that someone's meds are working after the 2nd combo when you've been working on combos for years, but that doesn't mean you should downvote them out of spite or jealousy."
1514,"If more and more people show success on X medication, maybe that's where the best treatment is, and you wouldn't know about it if someone didn't say something."
1515,I knew I'd probably be able to reduce my medication soon but did not expect it quite this soon.
1516,"Every morning I take my meds asap because I'll feel crappy until about an hour later when my klonopin, hydroxzyine, and benztropine kick in."
1517,Anyway after it took me a long time to titrate up to 150mg I started feeling really good in May and the start of June...my pdoc and I thought it was because the meds were working but in mid June I started heading back down into a depressive episode and I still am in the same depressive episode.
1518,So I think I may have actually been in a hypomanic episode instead of the meds actually helping.
1519,I am going on a trip next week and wasn't going to have enough meds for the whole trip so she called in a script for me and gave me a 90 day supply of it.
1520,I'm meeting with her again in about a week and a half and I feel really bad about telling her that im still feeling depressed and that the meds aren't working cause she just got me so much of the lamictal that would go to waste if we try something else.
1521,"I have been off meds for 4 months, dealing well with the end of a long term relationship and way more social than in the past."
1522,I was upfront about taking mdma on a few occasions since I last saw him and said I didn't want to be on so many meds because I want a social life too and anti psychotics make that hard.
1523,"I said anyone on so many meds will end up depressed from a lack of social life when everyone else they know there age can attend night time events and they can't, and basically I just wanted to try no meds."
1524,"He then told me that I have never looked so bad (maybe he was offended I didn't bother to wear makeup), I am a drug addict (weed maybe but not amphetamines which was what he was insisting, I just like to party sometimes), I will die without meds, I have a black eye (there was nothing wrong with my eye) and I must go to rehab before he will treat me again."
1525,I need to lose all of this medicine weight!
1526,5+ years of medicine weight gain and I need it to go!
1527,"I've been off my meds for about 4 months now, the first time since I was 7 years old."
1528,"I found a doctor after a manic episode I had about 2 months ago now who was able to help, and get me on some meds."
1529,Or is throeing meds at me the only thing that'll ever help.
1530,I understand that depression (my mania is being well controlled by my medication but my depression is another story) can make someone passive or indecisive so there's that.
1531,"Until very recently, I was able to take anti-anxiety meds to forget about the paranoia for a very short amount of time."
1532,He managed to get me to play a video game for a bit... but then it was time to take my meds and go to sleep.
1533,"As far as the depressive part of the symptoms, it seems fitting -- I've had depression since I was young, I have recurring bouts, I don't respond to medication, self-isolation, social anxiety, etc."
1534,I'm tapering off Wellbutrin and I start taking these new medications tomorrow morning.
1535,All I can think is what if this medication makes me psychotic?
1536,"Abilify was one of the medications my friend was on when he overdosed and died, so I'm already leery of that one."
1537,I am so tired of medications.
1538,"age 42 diagnosed type2 several years ago, struggling, whent off meds but seeing doc in am to go back on."
1539,In From August through November she was basically catatonic due to meds.
1540,"If it's any difference, she is off her meds now."
1541,"I got lucky with the meds my Dr put me on, they seemed to work pretty good."
1542,I have been on medications for 7 years now.
1543,"He has always made sure that I have took my meds, that if I need to talk or vent about anything I can, he is very very supportive and I am extremely lucky to have him in my life."
1544,"My advise to anyone is this: 
You are given meds for a reason, I realize that you feel weird on them and you don't feel like yourself."
1545,"I put a call into the doctor (it's Saturday, so it's sort of like what you in the US call walk-in, I think) and waiting for the call back, but they say generally they don't write prescriptions for this medication."
1546,"So, found the right meds, years of therapy, meditation, good diet, reintegrating, career goals the whole thing."
1547,Today I was rediagnosed with bipolar 2 for the third time and I'm going back this Monday to discuss medications.
1548,"However, since I'm stable and doing fine, I'm wondering if it's the meds causing the memory loss."
1549,(I take many meds but that is my choice and I choose which ones) that is literally what the general population wants and would take for them to ease up a little.
1550,"Not exercise, not meditation, not diet, not staying up all night, not even psychiatric meds."
1551,"Yes, I can take meds, i can change my habbits, all of these things I can do to make sure i stay as stable as possible... but i will ALWAYS have to do these things."
1552,This is actually week two but the first week was without my ADHD medication.
1553,I stopped taking my meds on the 23rd.
1554,I was so sick at 3.0 I'm   having heart pain twitching all over my body loss of hair I had throat pain along with unreal anxiety well sleeping waking up every hour he said I couldn't have any side effects at such a low blood level but I was reading other people feeling sick at this lower 3.0 I'm worried I don't know what to think if anyone know anything it would be helpful what do I ask my doctor to do help me please I'm in a in forced drug treatment program to get my charges reduced but part of the program is I must take meds but I've had so many side effects it's such a nightmare... started off at 900 mg lithium carbonate eskalith this is my third Med and I dont feel I have bipolar my family pushed me into it to get my charges reduced OMG I'm in he'll these meds make me sleep all the time loss of hair feeling numb depression so many weird problems blurred vision I'm only 34 and never had side effects / reactions to anything other than bug bites poison ivy  sun burn normal things.
1555,I have been too afraid to get off of this medication because of the traumatizing experience I had in the hospital and the aftermath.
1556,Is it time to take that leap or is the low dose of this medicine what's keeping me stable?
1557,"i take medicine, but i coudln't afford my psychiatrist anymore so I don't have anyone I can really ask and the internet is terrifying me more."
1558,"Wah :( I still have two more weeks until my appointment, until which time I have no meds (and no, there's nothing i can do about this except wait)."
1559,"I am very sensitive to medications, so they started me at 150mg, and slowly upped me 150mg at a time, to 600 mg. about a week and a half ago, they jumped from 600-900."
1560,I feel like this is a really intense medication to start out on.
1561,I am just now beginning medication treatment for bipolar.
1562,"It's not bad enough that I can't sleep at all (four hours or so, thanks to meds), so I don't even get that benefit (extra time to get things done)."
1563,Did you take meds during your pregnancy?
1564,Does anyone have experience with either of these two medications?
1565,"As far as medication, she suggested I look into Lithium and/or Depakote."
1566,I'm still not sure how I feel about taking meds but maybe some of you have experience with one of these and can tell me if it's improved your life.
1567,I am really struggling to keep taking my meds.
1568,"I miss hallucinating and going crazy 

I miss being insane...what the fuck is wrong with me...I shouldn't be upset that that I'm normal and happy and everyone is so much happier with me medicated I just don't feel like its me they love and its the meds."
1569,I have been thinking about taking meds but I have heard that sometimes they make it worse.
1570,"For the record, I take two medications - Lexapro nightly to manage my depression, and Klonopin for emergency episodes."
1571,Topamax is frequently prescribed to help us lose the weight put on by these meds.
1572,I'm 25 and am currently not on any of my bipolar medications.
1573,I have to track it to watch for hypomanic/manic episodes because of the medicines I get put on to treat my breathing problems.
1574,It is like me off of ADHD medicine for two days in a row.
1575,And I am ADHD mixed type and I can tell when I am off my medicine or the steroids cancel out what Vyvanse does.
1576,Same with the medication.
1577,"Until I can afford meds, I am having to try to control my mania the best I can."
1578,I'm aware that this depends on the person and medication but I'm interested in hearing about this.

&amp;nbsp;

In the days when therapy rather than medication was the vogue the  folk singer [Katie Lee] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Lee_(singer))  released two albums; [*Songs of Couch and Consultation*] (https://open.spotify.com/album/1LIJ0eGi7SKHJXaTTkZ1Fk) (1957), and [*Life is Just a Bed of Neuroses*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6NlFKMWoYRYHnUsVs4Z2Y5) (1960)."
1580,"This is right after I switched meds, and now I've crashed harder than ever before."
1581,"One medication that I'm on called gabapentin, a mood stabilizer, only comes in 100mg capsules."
1582,"I am in a demanding academic field so given that my experience with Risperdol was a disaster with focus and confusion, I'd like to hear a reason to believe that these medications are different."
1583,Maybe one day you could get on medication for it and it will help you.
1584,"I should mention that is was not exclusively sleep aids that would trigger her psychotic episodes, but on several occasions other medicines as well."
1585,"She was kept at the center for a little over a week, and began taking a low dosage anti-psychotic medicine (maybe anti-manic medicine I can't remember what the doctor said) along with other counselling and treatment."
1586,"She will most likely not need the medicine forever, according to the doctor, but will have to be more careful in the future what type of medications she takes."
1587,Right now I am pretty poor so I stopped taking my medicine.
1588,"Just over two months ago, I stopped taking my medicine."
1589,Do they really teach psychiatrists to diagnose disorders like that in meds schools or are psychiatrists just incompetent because nobody evaluate and verify their competence once they finish school?
1590,"I just recently (this past month) found the proper mix of medication, therapy, and coping skills to keep myself grounded and more or less level."
1591,"Mine asks the same questions every time, prescribes me meds that run out a week or 2 before I am supposed to see him next (without fail)."
1592,"The worst part is... she won't take her meds, even when she is going through her episodes."
1593,"My dad has told her countless times to go see a doctor and get medications, and every single time she says shes fine and that my dad needs to go see a doctor."
1594,I have told my mom to go get her medication but every time I bring it up she gets super angry and tells me to mind my own business.
1595,Go see a doctor and get medication 2.
1596,"I can't convince her to take her meds, my Dad can't, and her sisters can't."
1597,I have read so many posts on here and I just want to say GOODJOB to those people that realize they have a episode coming and they take their meds.
1598,"She never takes her meds to calm down, so I feel like I don't know who she is anymore."
1599,I've been taking my medications.
1600,Do you think this could be because of the medication or does somebody get also facial tics with mania?
1601,Her purging is down with some help from her new meds and acceptance but the void of giving up her coping mechanism has escalated her mania as I now know it to heights that I'm struggling to handle.
1602,I keep telling myself that this is all new and it will get sorted out with the proper meds and treatment but every rational brain cell I have is telling me that being lied to and manipulated for 10 years should send me packing.
1603,"Lately though I've been looking back at some things I've done and mood patterns and kind of realized bipolar disorder might fit the bill better, but I wanted some outside opinions on that so here's a list of symptoms I've noticed in myself/other people have noted:
*Periods of time where I make lots of irresponsible decisions such as last minute dropping out of college when I was doing well, meeting/have sex with a stranger from an internet dating site, continuing to see a person who physically abused me, randomly deciding to stop medication (many times)
*Bouts of bad depression where I self-harmed 
*Binging/purging
*Periods of time where I made tons of unrealistic plans, like suddenly deciding to find a new apartment, buy a new car, or transfer schools
*Short periods of time where I felt I couldn't calm down (running around like a nut at work/generally being childish) which is really out of character for me (I'm generally calm)

I feel like this could go on forever."
1604,"Stopped taking the meds, sick of the brain fog."
1605,that help him just not go back and forth between medication and nonmedication?
1606,"I also have PTSD, which was misdiagnosed as bipolar for years and the resulting medication made me so sick, tired and miserable that there is little I will not do to avoid bringing on bipolar."
1607,"I have been taking my medication (40 mg of latuda), seeing my therapist and have been trying to do everything how I am supposed to."
1608,"i took my medicine (7.5mg abilify, 500mg depakote) and 1mg of ativan."
1609,"Over the past few years she has been virtually UN medicated because either meds she tried before stopped working, or she could not tolerate the side effects."
1610,To make matters worse she has a paradoxical effect in medication and blood work confirms she lacks the liver enzymes to absorb most medications.
1611,"Some of the reasons I suspect this are because she:
-has absolutely zero patience
-has virtually no control over her emotions
-can go from happy and content to a fit if seething rage over something that irritated her or made her angry
-has destructive and violent tendencies
-is an admitted shopaholic 
-though surprisingly she does well with medications, she has a very very addictive personality (TV/Facebook/shopping/tunnel vision on tasks)
-has checked herself into mental hospital twice trying to get help
-has suicidal fantasies and makes frequent statements about it 
-runs at the energy level of a car redlining at 8000rpms then crashes and will be in bed sleep for days; exacerbated by Fibro."
1612,"I guess I am liking for ideas in what to do when I get the texts saying come home and dell MJ her mommy will be dead later, or what to do to convince the doctors to seriously consider more than just anxiety and depression,or how to find a doctor that understands HIGH anxiety people and is not afraid to give klonipin or Xanax to someone who has documented reasons for taking opioid pain medication given they at least worked to calm the outbursts."
1613,I have a family friend that I talked to when I had major problems or started a new medication.
1614,I go on medication (or sometimes not) and then I go insane.
1615,"I'm considering meds, but if I had a choice between thyroid shutdown and weed, guess which one I'm going with."
1616,"Help...


**Further explanation**

I don't know why, but meds often work great in the beginning and then abruptly and/or rapidly stop working or go south."
1617,"So the meds must have had some positive effect if not being on it made life horrid, right?"
1618,I'm 98 pounds and have had interesting reactions to an array of different medications (e.g.
1619,"Mid-late May, my boyfriend broke up with me because of the worst depressive episode I've ever had that happened despite being on medication."
1620,I've started medication and I'm seeing a therapist.
1621,Ive been off my medication for 4 months now.
1622,"Anyways,  I called up the health line and asked if only bipolar people can experience mania from medications, they told me no it can happen to anyone, even non bipolar people."
1623,Before I was taking medication I'd never have those highs that seem to come with bipolar disorder.
1624,"But when I took my first dose of the meds today, I was incredibly nervous and shaking."
1625,It's...new...I know the medicine is there to help me.
1626,"I'm on medication, Saphris, but it's ruining my body."
1627,My friends have been encouraging me to not go back on meds and my parents are telling me to get a job and questioning the need for regular doctors appointments because I'm doing so much better than this time last year.
1628,"I have just come out of a month long manic episode where I ended a 4yr relationship, had a lot of sex, did a lot of drugs and went off my meds."
1629,"I don't know why I am posting, just frustrated with the people closest to me not understanding why I need to see pdocs and take meds."
1630,"I'm on abilify, klonopin, &amp; stallera, as well as prednisone &amp; a few other meds/chemo for RA."
1631,My questions more pertain to medication.
1632,Can anyone describe some medications stories about how they were affected?
1633,His paranoid tendencies greatly subsided after two hospitalizations and the right anti-psychotic medication.
1634,"And despite getting put on more meds, I still feel like I can function!"
1635,"I don't think the meds are working, but they make me feel weird to the point an increase my harm my limited abilities at school, though that is basically a moot point since I am not doing my work now."
1636,(We are both 26 now) She meets a psychiatrist every now and then that prescribes her medication every now and then.
1637,"She has been on medication ever since we have been going out and it feels like for a good couple months everything is perfect, then her symptoms would creep back and her world would start spiraling out of control."
1638,"To make things clear, she is on meds (doesn't really seem to help because she cycles every 9-10months), she has not yet gone through therapy (only meets a Psych every now and then)."
1639,"I was actually kind of relieved to have a diagnosis of bipolar, because something wasn't working right with the medication for depression."
1640,"I was hesitant to start on my new cocktail of medication, but as I started to get better I realized it was the right thing for me."
1641,"I was seeing a councillor once a week, and taking my medication, and starting to get out for a walk here and there, and generally eating well, all the things I needed to do to feel better."
1642,"It took effort, and it took trust in my doctor, and always taking my medication, but I got there."
1643,It might take months to find the right medication for you.
1644,So I am starting the process of getting off my meds on March 6.
1645,It led to him being in the ER for an entire day and then being placed in a mental facility for 21 days to get through this first episode and to place him on new medicines and to get them regulated.
1646,"He was only on Prozac before this happened, and then he came home from the facility on 7 medicines."
1647,He was unable to perform at his job that he had for 3 years due to the medicines making him so out of it.
1648,We have worked with his doctor to get the okay on going off some of the medicines to attempt to remove the zombie effect from them.
1649,"Over the past few months and numerous visits with his doctor, we have finally gotten down to 2 medicines."
1650,"I know I probably repeated myself a few times and that this is probably more of a relationship advice type thread, and I apologize for that - but since this is such a drastic change in his personality from before, I can't help but wonder if it's his medicine?"
1651,Do any of you have any experiences with these medicines that are similar?
1652,I'm supposed to go on Lamictal next week after a GP-appointment when I'll get my meds and some blood tests.
1653,Will I still be me with these meds?
1654,"I am pretty well medicined, except when it comes to my rare cases of hypomania."
1655,"It has been unpredictable when it happens, but it's usually within hours of taking my meds."
1656,Today was the worst it's been and hit very suddenly about 30min after meds.
1657,I'm terrified to take my meds yet I know that I have to.
1658,I'm so afraid to take my meds.
1659,I'm pretty sure that I'm going to need to be prepared to be required to change some of my regular meds at my upcoming dr appt this week after my manic episode that has required some pretty strong drugs to get under control.
1660,I feel like this is often correlated with and can also be a side effect of some medications.
1661,"Are there any therapies, workbooks, or medicines you would recommend?"
1662,"Just a precursor, I am NOT thinking about stopping my meds, I need them."
1663,"I have forgotten to take my meds a few times (Cymbalta, Lamictal, Seroquel--Bipolar-II)."
1664,"And it is why I have the notion that my medications are ""holding me hostage""."
1665,In the beginning of my senior year of college I had been feeling great that summer and decided to start reducing my medicines with my psychiatrist.
1666,I always planned to completely be off my meds by the end of college.
1667,"I had to accept the fact that I will probably be on medication for most of my life, and do have a mental disorder that I have to deal with."
1668,I think it's been going on about six weeks since I last took any meds.
1669,"I like being off my meds, because I don't have to take them anymore- but I hate how I feel all over again."
1670,"I really feel let down by the system, I'm upset that maybe I could have gone to university or studied anyone of the things I love in this world, if only someone over the years had said, you know you don't have to have full blown mania to be BP and there is a whole other group of meds that might help."
1671,"My depressive episodes have been fewer and far much less intense than before I went on medication, and if my hypomania has been affected, I have not noticed the difference, nor has anyone close to me."
1672,At first I thought medication was working.
1673,I can accept that I may be ADHD also but it scares me to accept that I am not bipolar and go on to ADHD meds instead just because the therapists office I go to specializes in ADHD.
1674,"I've been on meds since I started seeing them, so I'm thinking that is probably why they aren't diagnosing me with bipolar--  bc my meds are working."
1675,"But then I moved away for college and things went to shit; I couldn't remember to take my meds everyday, and just couldn't take care of myself, show ever every day, or even go to class."
1676,"Then about 8 months ago I lost my insurance, so I couldn't go to therapy/get meds anymore, so I've had to deal with it by myself for a while."
1677,"I thought I could manage without meds but lately I've really, really wanted some Ambien to help me sleep and some Vyvanse to help me be more alert in the day, and some Xanax or something for when I get panic attacks."
1678,My doctor changed my medicine last time I saw her (and when she made this referral) to just plain zoloft and it's not doing a thing for me.
1679,I just need to get on the right meds and just relax.
1680,"I warned my doctor about what I'm on and she told me I need to take this medicine, the need outweighs the risk."
1681,I was put on some medication that my later doctor couldn’t believe was prescribed for me.
1682,"I probably shouldn’t be, and I haven’t told anyone this, but I’m off my medication."
1683,"We went outside to smoke a cigarette and started talking about life and how I wanted to be a writer, but I'm struggling because I feel that my medicine inhibits my abilities and all that stuff."
1684,"I am rather new to this (Diagnosed last fall Bipolar 2 and GAD) and I tried medication (Lithium and something that started with an A for the anxiety...I honestly can't remember) 

I did very poorly on the medication."
1685,"Extremely exhausted, cloudy, sluggish and generally felt flat lined as well as rapid weight gain caused by the medication."
1686,I later learned that I had been prescribed far too much Lithium - tell that to the closet of clothes that don't fit right now :P. I still owe my university for my diagnosis and medication.
1687,Some medication im on actually helps produce new growth of dopamine receptors causing depression... i fill them with dope.
1688,So that medication is out of the question.
1689,Edit:  I forgot to mention that there has been a dramatic improvement in my mental health since I started the meds.
1690,"I'm on meds, but I feel like they aren't really helping."
1691,This time we are going to try to get away with a lower dosage and hope that my response to medication is better tempered.
1692,"Having tried a long list of medications which haven't worked, I am getting more radical and returning to Lithium despite horrific side effects."
1693,Luckily the medication will start working soon.
1694,My psychologist thinks I may be bipolar II and wants me to consider going on medication to help manage it.
1695,I've been reading about how people react to various medications and how  it seems to be a bunch of trial and error with trying to find the right one.
1696,I don't want to get on meds have an adverse reaction and end up doing something I'll regret because it wasn't the right kind.
1697,No meds.
1698,Hits me with some kind of medication and then I black out.
1699,Do you ever drink and miss your meds that night and the next day you basically feel manic all day?
1700,Following this meeting I devoured literature on bipolar disorder and the medications I was taking and the wikipedia explanations of manic phases rang true.
1701,"My family resents me for my medication and thinks I've cheated, yet it makes me feel like I can accomplish things and feel good about myself."
1702,I'm trying to push the argument that medication has changed my political views but nobody will believe it.
1703,I thought it was one off so in 2012 went off medication.
1704,And since then I’ve been incredibly careful to stick to my medication regimen and make it my top priority.
1705,I have had paradoxical reactions to other meds.
1706,Antihistamine based sleeping meds make me aggressive and paranoid.
1707,Anti nausea meds make me agitated and distraught.
1708,"After hurting myself badly about 6 weeks ago, I started seeing a therapist and reevaluated my meds with my pdoc."
1709,"I'm just wondering if anyone is able to answer a quick question about meds that make you gain weight... can this weight translate into muscle if you're working out, or does it pack on too fast for that to be possible?"
1710,"I'm just wondering what the standard (or indeed, best) procedure is for medication."
1711,"It's been a month since our first session, I've been (sort of) taking my meds, I haven't noticed much of a difference."
1712,I had prescription drug coverage and spent about $30 a month on meds.
1713,I do really well on my medication but I just found out the costs and I need a bit of help.
1714,"So in all, my meds are going to cost me about $150 a month which is wayyy beyond what I can pay for."
1715,"I think I'm kind of being harassed...by an unstable pnp, no less 
:(

Summary: Way back months and months ago, about a month after I'd been diagnosed, my psych and I agreed that-juuuuuust perhaps-it might be a good idea for medication."
1716,"I find a very excellent pnp, get a proper evaluation, get my meds."
1717,My concern is I'm not entirely convinced I'm bipolar and my psychiatrist hasn't been very forth coming when I ask questions almost as if she's just throwing meds at me to see what works.
1718,"The previous visit she made a comment that she wasn't completely convinced I wasn't bipolar but she'd have to look into it further... so as soon as I told her I related to the symptoms of atypical depression almost as much as I did ADD she jumped on that and prescribed me Lamotrigine, which I know is a medication for bipolar disorder."
1719,"Now he has not been on medication in the 4 years I have known him, and he seems to be doing okay."
1720,"My next question is, is there any negative of him not taking medication currently, if he is relatively happy/ stabilized?"
1721,I don't want to push for medication since he seems to be handling okay.
1722,I take the same meds everyday and this seems to only happen when I'm hypomanic or manic.
1723,"You know, like when you're withdrawing from medication?"
1724,So I ran out off my medication and I just found out I lost my health insurance.
1725,"After years of mostly depression, I've gotten on some good meds and have finally felt functional."
1726,He didn't change my meds at all.
1727,"But when you're only halfway up,

That's called stable

And you take medicine to achieve this delicate state."
1728,Since going back on my medications I have gone up to 107 kg.
1729,"I have a history of periods of sexual promiscuity and risk taking behavior (I once slept with seven men over the course of a month and a half, I also regularly take drugs recreationally and it does often reflect self medication- however I never drink."
1730,Which is stupid while being on my meds and underage but I just want to have a little fun.
1731,"I take other meds in the morning to help control my bipolar disorder (though they don't really help, working on finding something that works..) My up and down swings are intense and last weeks at a time."
1732,"She has been on meds and engaging in counseling for years, but I'm wondering if it's helping her."
1733,"My meds have to be switched up every few months, because my body gets used to them or something."
1734,Tired of the meds.
1735,"The thing is though that I am afraid of taking medication, the reason is that I like who I am when I'm in ""fast mode"" with that I mean I become very outgoing, funny, charming, working hard, feeling like I am at the top of the world."
1736,So what I am  wondering is what will happen if I take medication?
1737,"I've been off medication for over a year now, and my life has been flipped upside down and I've been kicked it the heart two times for good measure in the past 6 months."
1738,"My old meds didn't work for me, even though I stayed on each cocktail for at least three months."
1739,All I feel is pressure and pain and I looked up the lethal dosage of my meds.
1740,"We've tried before to get her to see a doctor about it, and possibly get medication, but she looked into it briefly and saw that a side affect was possible heart attacks, so she thought we were trying to kill her."
1741,I can’t afford my medication anymore and have been off of it for about two months now.
1742,"fuck when i am writing this i realize how bad idea it is, but i prefer it over any of the coping meds my doctor could prescribe me, but i will probably never ask for them, and i have turned down offers."
1743,Took 3 years to get the meds set.
1744,"I've had some severe episodes when off meds but this is the first time shit went wrong when I was ""doing"" right."
1745,I thought all I had to do was fight it with medicine and try to get by.
1746,"I haven't felt this way before, it's something that started since I began taking my medication (Abilify and Cogentin) this last month."
1747,"And scared of the ECT scheduled for Friday, of course, which I can no longer medicate-away the fears of (my money, bank card, car keys, meds etc have all been confiscated.)"
1748,You are on so many meds and at different doses that you can't remember them all so you need an old person pill organizer.
1749,"After a year and 1/2 of being off medication (well, besides self-meds), I went to see my doctor, a brilliant guy who I trust, and got Lamictal (and Xanax, but that's irrelevant)."
1750,That I could call myself normal and that I could continue to write a big NO in capital letters anytime I needed to fill out a form that asked if I took any medications.
1751,"They switched me to ablify because my old meds where doing bad things to my body, and my mind."
1752,Therapy and medication only go so far in helping you; Sometimes you have to give yourself a hand.
1753,"Since then I've needed medication to sleep almost every night to sleep, because I get chest pain and the panic is worse at night before bed, that's when I have attacks."
1754,"I did start part time work, my meds are on track and stuff."
1755,I went off of my lithium medication about a year ago due to my hair falling out and tremors.
1756,I have been thinking strongly about going onto some new medication and some anti anxiety medication... but there are so many factors that are overwhelming to me.
1757,she didn't take her meds all last month and I basically avoided her because of it.
1758,now that we're separated i'm waking up a bit to how i important I know it is she takes her meds.
1759,shes told me all the bad stuff that's happened to her in life and it's almost always stories of when she was off her meds.
1760,but I believe i'm being 1million percent honest as a human can be when I say that all I care about is that I know she takes her meds.
1761,"i dont know how else to describe my concern for her, but if I could, i would ask her to transform all the love she once had for me and use it to have her start taking her meds."
1762,I already bombarded her with emails last night about taking her meds which led to the blocking.
1763,edit: she had also been telling me towards the end that she has been feeling like the meds haven't been working like they're supposed to.
1764,I have told my NP and she told me to immediately stop my medication.
1765,My question is this: Has any of you ladies taken any medication while pregnant?
1766,"Again, I have not taken Lamictal for a month and am currently on no medications."
1767,He believes that his work will soon bring him great fame and prosperity and that meds will dilute his thoughts and creativity.
1768,"For any of you that know anything about blood sugar it was bad, I was having consistent high morning blood sugars no matter what I did to control it (like 400 high) I had no choice but to quit the medication cold turkey."
1769,"I feel like my medicine (meds + therapy) has got me more in touch with myself than I was before, I'm able to listen to myself and be a better person."
1770,Most recently I had a realization that I'm on 3 different meds just to feel normal.
1771,In fact her dad may do his best to convince her to stop taking her meds because god told him he should make her stop.
1772,"Some history, I am on a few meds for my bipolar type 2 (lamictal, pristiq, ability), and they make it impossible to focus at work (although they have been great at stabilizing me)."
1773,I'm definitely still adjusting to the meds.
1774,I'm a coffee drinker and I have to say that I crave it so much more intensely since starting the medication.
1775,I developed full on social phobia before the medication.
1776,The medication really makes me feel so normal and I don't want to go un-medicated.
1777,I feel like I've gotten a lot more aggressive over the past couple days because I lost my meds.
1778,"Within the past year or so, I began to eat at least one to two meals a day again, and then more recently have been working on my medication balance."
1779,I have always been depressed but since the manic episode passed and I started the medication it has been worse.
1780,"I have never been prescribed anything (i have stated this intention from the beginning, and no doctor has attempted to convince me - they do discourage my occasional heavy and persistent drinking)    
     
a lot of people here talk about their medication, comparing side effects."
1781,"I was wondering;     
1) how many people have any proper education in psychology, medicine, biochem, neuroscience, statistical analysis etc?"
1782,I'm really nervous because though she put me on medication like I had hoped I have such a terrible experience on antidepressants.
1783,Some mistakes are part of the disorder such as suicide attempts and screaming matches while off meds.
1784,I had to stop taking my medication.
1785,"When I finally was able to receive public health care, my doctors put me on a different medication, because I was taking a pill called Provigil and they said its not used to treat depression."
1786,But for the past few days I've felt like its all a lie and there is nothing wrong with me and the side effects from my meds just aren't worth it.
1787,I'm sick of this meds dance that I've been in since I was 13.
1788,I have had several anxiety attacks and no meds.
1789,Since I started my meds last december i've been noticing that im getting... slower.
1790,"Anyways, I really have seen fantastic results from lamictal, but unfortunately,  it looks like I have to look for another medicine."
1791,I’ve been put on medications to help the depression… the mental disorders that doctors are so quick to diagnose.
1792,"Hi, I was looking for opinions on some of the different meds for bipolar (recently diagnosed type 1) currently taking venlafaxine 125mg x 2."
1793,"Currently having a treatment/medication plan built, somewhat complictaed by the fact that I can't be trusted with too many meds because I have a history of suicidal overdoses (the kicker I suppose is that if I actually got a stable medication/therapy plan in place I mighy get some control on my self harm and suicidal behaviour.)"
1794,"I was even able to yank myself out of a fledgling manic episode with relaxation, breathing exercises, etc... And yet they upped my meds."
1795,She asked if I had tried stopping them before I started taking the new medicine.
1796,"He plans to adjust my meds next visit, currently 200mg Seroquel."
1797,I've had to keep track of my moods and been trying some meds and it's been really hard but it's starting to make more sense now.
1798,"I'm responding to Lupus medication, but a muscle/nerve biopsy came back clean, so it's not any known form of Lupus."
1799,I feel that way on meds.
1800,"Since this point, I have been tried on various medications resulting in very unwanted zombiefying side effects, and even a DUI that resulted after taking a SINGLE dose of clonazepam given to me after hospitlization."
1801,"As a result of all of this, I went off all medications, and I believe this is where drugs and alcohol started coming in."
1802,Stabilized on meds after years and years of complete and utter chaos.
1803,"I'm really afraid of self-diagnosing, but I also am afraid of being diagnosed with regular depression and being given meds that might cause me to become manic."
1804,I am really hoping that getting out of bed to study and taking trips to the library with friends will help me get back to my baseline (with the help of meds of course).
1805,"I feel like every time something doesn't go perfectly forever, my pdoc wants to change my medicine."
1806,How do you deal with anxiety when you don't want to change your medicine?
1807,I haven't taken any meds in over 3 years after having a severe manic episode about 5 years ago.
1808,"However, I think I need to change my meds."
1809,Now for why I think I might need additional help with a change in medication.
1810,"TL;DR
I'm in a scenerio where natural events are running their natural course and it's taking its toll on me, or these events are signifying my meds are no longer working how they are intended to."
1811,"When I take my meds regularly, my sex life drops to non-existent."
1812,This is the number one reason I don't stay on my meds.
1813,"My mom is bipolar, and she has some deep, deep depressive waves if she doesn't pay close attention to her meds."
1814,"I've never really considered suicide (once I started the meds), which is kind of my ""red flag"" for 'really bad depression'."
1815,I'm so sick of meds.
1816,"I'm so sick of having to put up with them, because the only other options are a) the joyless, soul-crushing uselessness that comes when you're changing meds, and  b) the utter piece of shit that I feel like when I'm not on meds at all."
1817,"All she could talk about was how much she hated the meds, how much she hated being dependent on them, how frustrating it was to wait for the right combination to randomly fall into her lap."
1818,"Tired of fighting, tired of the meds, tired of doctors telling me they don’t know how to help me."
1819,I guess basically I am wondering does anyone know how long it will be before the meds really start working and I can feel normal?
1820,"My therapist said I should ask other people inflicted with BPI and see what they have to say about it, I know for a fact that it is my medication, but is it too much?"
1821,"One of my current meds, Abilify, comes from a Japanese manufacturer, so I'm fairly certain I could obtain it in Japan, but I'm also on Wellbutrin and less sure about that one."
1822,I have gone through the long grueling process of determining the best fit for medications and the one I currently take has things under control for me.
1823,I know that medications aren't perfect though so I should get to know when I'm having hypomania so I can prepare for it in the future if/or when it happens.
1824,I can vividly remember the passion I held before starting my medication and before my disorder started to really kick in.
1825,"Apathy was still present before my medication, but now its consistent."
1826,I know medication is necessary to feel 'sane.'
1827,"if somebody comes in saying ""I can't sleep"" don't suggest specific medicines."
1828,"I have the biggest opportunity, moving out of the country to europe to get married in just two weeks so although that is awesome it is a little stressful and my family and friends are all upset that i'm leaving I can't see my mom for 5 seconds until she starts crying and i just feel so fucking guilty guilty guilty they adopted me and now I'm leaving them at only 21 i haven't lived with them for three years I live a little bit away but it's still hurting them so much i can't stand the pain i've put in other so i direct it at myself I haven't cut myself in so long but last night and today I am just having a fucking freak out like I want to call the hospital because I feel like it's an emergency and I am a danger to myself but I can't be baker acted (it would be my second time and it's finals week and i don't want it to mess with my visa or my flight) I just need my meds I think or maybe I'm addicted to them and going through withdrawals god damnit why can't I just be normal fuck fuck fuck 

i dn't even know if i should post this here if it will trigger people i don't know i'm sorry"
1829,"I take bipolar medication which helps a little, but I'm always afraid of losing control of my body and re-living something horrible that never happened to me."
1830,"The meds help, but all I've had as far as ""mania"" goes is suffering from someone else's trauma."
1831,"She opened and maxed out several cards, bottomed out and over drafted bank accounts on things that aren't returnable and now I am left scrambling for some money for very basic things like house hold bills and her medicine / therapy."
1832,"• Besides medicine (which she's on and taking, but we haven't found the right mix) how can someone with bi-polar step themselves down from a compulsive spending manic episode?"
1833,"She is seeing a psychiatrist as well as a counselor and we haven't found a right ""mix"" of medicines or techniques to calm the behaviors, but we're only a few months into this."
1834,I have always had a high tolerance to medication.
1835,"I am currently, and have been for 5+ years, on 450mg of Lamotrigine daily (amongst other meds)."
1836,Is anyone else in the same situation and if so did your doc add another medicine to combo with it or change meds all together?
1837,"I had a hard believing it at first, and refused any medication they wanted to give me (Because in the country I come from, they give pills to everyone for everything, even when it's possible to do otherwise)."
1838,Even the changes in my medications didn't change that.
1839,"I became so bored I developped some chronic boredom, and started feeling depressed and tired more and more even with the medication."
1840,"I felt like no medication could help me, because we tried lots of them with my Pdoc."
1841,"With this insurance, I have a lovely medication deductible of $2000 on top of my regular deductible of $2500."
1842,"That brings my medication cost to an estimated $250 (estimated by the pharmacist), which could change (read: increase) based on how the insurance company would view a new prescription order from a new doctor or something."
1843,"She hasn't been on her meds for about 4 months now, mainly because we don't have insurance and we can't afford any of her meds (we've tried medicaid, disability, and those free med programs with no luck), but also because she doesn't like how the meds make her feel."
1844,"ive been pacing for days on end tried everything only thing that works is Valium and im out and cant get any more (used to take it twice a month) 


i have no idea whats going on and being young enough that they caught it early im screwed (bipolar 2) im at risk of losing my income over this too now.......im not the happy manic eather......being that weird fked up kind of bipolar 2 i get the low manic stages and the high's are sooooo rare (been 3 years since ive as much as smiled) i tried another sleeping tablet the doctor gave me instead of Valium and it made things worse (caused sesuires for me) 

at 4 days no sleep im just over it all......

my doctor is extremely worried as i have always shown strong self harm tendinces hence why he wont give me any more valium....

im at a loss as for what to do im taking my medications normally 

i keep getting put into tears too at the smallest things.....and hearing i am about to be forsed back to work is killing me im sooo scared i cant go through the 9-5 7 days a week."
1845,it makes things 10x worse....ive just gotten out of my 5 hospitalization (2014) so i know all my meds are fine.
1846,"Thanks to icemaggedon we weren't able to get the meds until today, but now I'm scared to take them."
1847,"I've been 'me' for 22 years and I feel like the medicine will make me lose what makes me me, and will make me unrecognizable."
1848,But it did cause problems with college and I know I need the meds to help me get to a point in my life where I can finally finish college and get a real job and go on to finally be independent and build my own life.
1849,"I had a major break after coming off my meds on my own and after getting myself into almost $20,000 into debt this summer, I am now back to work and back on track."
1850,"It took almost 5 months just to get me back on meds, and then another couple months to get them all straightened out and now I feel amazing."
1851,As far as I know she consistently takes her medication.
1852,"Meanwhile, I have no refills left on my meds."
1853,He has accepted his diagnosis and is taking the medication and going to the in-treatment discussions every week.
1854,Basically my questions.. Is he acting like this because he is getting used to the new meds?
1855,"If he was fine for 3 years without medication, does he really need to be dosed up to the point where he isn't even the same person?"
1856,I'm calling my doctor tomorrow to ask for an appointment and some heavier meds.
1857,"I'm diagnosed with cyclothymia, and it's manegable with medication."
1858,What did you do when you found out and did the treatment for that physical ailment help your physical and mental state without needing the BP meds any more?
1859,"As if I took the ""easy"" way out and let medicine do the work."
1860,Does anyone else worry about developing tardive dyskinesia from long term use of antipsychotic medication?
1861,"""Tardive dyskinesia most commonly occurs in patients with psychiatric conditions who are treated with antipsychotic medications for many years."
1862,"The average prevalence rate has been estimated to be around 30% for individuals taking antipsychotic medication, such as that used to treat schizophrenia."
1863,"According to this research study, 26% of patients developed tardive dyskinesia after just one year on the medication."
1864,It's a terrible thing to admit but I'll be honest I haven't been on my meds for a couple weeks now.
1865,"It's now been 51 hours since I came off my medication (Citalopram + Quetiapine), and have yet to hold any food or fluid down for more than 20 minutes at a time."
1866,"For anybody that has come off medication like this, how long did it take before your body re-adjusted?"
1867,"I'm a single parent to an amazing 6 year old boy, and i just didn't focus or even function on the meds."
1868,"The psychiatrist just asks if I want more medication (apparently the next one will mean regular blood tests to check liver and kidney function), which I really am not sure about."
1869,She also talked me through medication.
1870,It's Friday so I take my meds two hours late because I go to group.
1871,"However, I'm reading Katherine Sharpe's ""Coming of Age on Zoloft"" and she brings up an interesting point: depressed and bipolar people have been going on and off different meds for so many years that they lose their sense of self--it's hard for them to remember which parts of it all are actually the true ""you."""
1872,"I have to admit, I feel a bit lost when I'm trying to be true to myself as I've been through nearly a dozen meds since the age of 13."
1873,She even went as far as refusing completely to comply with the doctors medication suggestions.
1874,"Well on the 12th, 11 days ago, I noted my swings starting to disappear (I chart my moods now) and I'm not sure if the medicine is finally actually working or if I'm just hypomanic again."
1875,"So I guess the question I have is, if the meds are working and I am ""better"", what the hell am I supposed to do with myself now?"
1876,I'm still constantly changing meds.
1877,I'm scared a shelter will be a fucking terrible place while my meds are changing and I barley have the energy to call them all but I guess I have to.
1878,"If you are currently on a medication that helps, how long did it take for you to get there, and do you recall how many meds it took?"
1879,Here's something I've been wondering about since I found a medicine that truly works.
1880,"On an average day with my new meds, I feel better than I could after taking a dose of codeine."
1881,We are both bipolar and she refuses to take meds.
1882,Im not currently on meds and without a job and mostly exhausted the care system i usually get them at.
1883,"Im tired of having to remind her to take meds,at least one of us can be on them,she has never been on them for more than a month.She has always had more power in the relationship because i have a problem keeping a job."
1884,"I have had literally over 50 jobs in my life,sad i cant keep it together.Even with meds its hard...they often stop working for me."
1885,"But i can be a recluse..""Good fences make good neighbors""
 I can get emergency meds but only a month."
1886,What were you experiences with any medication that was increased after you were at a stable dose for a significant time?
1887,When I went to take my meds last night I realized I only had 2 pills left (was short one).
1888,"Now since half a year i've been on medications again, I feel ""normal"" but that only lasted a few weeks."
1889,I had stopped all meds the last few months and went to see my Dr today.
1890,My meds that had been working on me for 10 years suddenly stopped doing their magic.
1891,"This was when I was on the meds, and they were working."
1892,He has weaned me off all my medication and I'm am slipping into despair.
1893,I see my doctor again this Saturday and I'm asking to be put back on my meds.
1894,"I feel ""stable"" but at the same time I am getting odd thoughts and feelings that I've had while I have been sick on another medication and they have been very intrusive."
1895,"I feel like I have disconnected from every one and retreat into isolation

 I don't know if its one of the medications I am on or my condition but I feel this foreign feeling creeping into my consciousness even while my mood or mode is calm."
1896,Say key phrases and ask certain questions and according to the manual prescribe a medication and send the client out the door.
1897,The meds aren't working.
1898,"I am not bipolar, but someone I love (romantically) is and they do not take medication or see a therapist."
1899,Luckily my willpower returned with the medicine.
1900,"I was on a few different meds for a few months earlier in the year until I ran out, and due to other things going on since I haven't gotten them refilled and have been off meds for 1-2 months."
1901,"I'm just getting medicaid after being uninsured (and thus untreated) for a few years and looking to start treatment again (medication has been helpful for me, but I've had little to no real therapy.)"
1902,Been feeling all over the place and meds aren't helping fast enough (ie lamictal takes forever to get on the proper dose!!)
1903,I'm not sure how it affects my medication.
1904,"My fucking medicine has helped me gain a LOT of weight, and it really, really bothers me."
1905,Problem is I might have had one back in 2004 (10 years ago) but then I was so darn messed up on antidep.med (Citalopram or Mirtazapin plus Propavan (sleeping meds?))
1906,The one thing that scares me about getting on medication is losing my creativity.
1907,"It's been my only drive to keep going many times, and I worry that taking any sort of medication will inhibit these abilities."
1908,Has anyone currently on medication noticed any sort of shift in their creative abilities?
1909,"I've heard so many people talk about brain fog of being a zombie after meds, and that's exactly what I'd like to avoid."
1910,I'm probably going to go to the smoke shop right now to purchase some salvia(its a strong psychedelic Dissociative plant that you smoke) dunno how it will mix with my meds but I don't really care right now I just want to forget everything about my life.
1911,"My pdoc said I could either change meds, or add another, because lamictal gives me headaches."
1912,"Hi guys,lately I have been pretty stable in my life after being diagnosed with bp1 (getting help,regular psychiatrist meetings and medication) but I feel completely empty and I think to myself that before atleast I could feel things,connect with people and I'm starting to become more and more withdrawn."
1913,I'm starting to think that medication may not be the best option.
1914,"Everything was going great even though in the beginning, the meds were making me tired all the time."
1915,My meds are gone and I feel nothing.
1916,But how do I stay on track with no access to meds or support?
1917,I still talk to my west coast therapist but it's not enough with my meds.
1918,I've been on it before with a different combination of medications and I seemed to have a shorter fuse than usual.
1919,"Maybe I'm just numb from the medication, but I have no urge to date anyone or make new friends."
1920,Seroquel (200mg) was one of the first meds I was put on about 8 months ago and it really helped a lot with my depression (I think - maybe the other meds helped the depression?).
1921,I'm just wondering... do medicines just stop working after awhile?
1922,"Thus, this is the first time [in my life] that I've ever been on meds or with real assistance."
1923,"I feel better than I ever have with any other medication before - there are still tweaks here and there, but overall I feel good."
1924,"When I first started taking this medication, it made me feel drowsy."
1925,This is not the first time I've noticed a shift in what side effects I experience from any one medication.
1926,"I notice it most with sleep patterns, actually - when I start a medication, it will hit one extreme (drowsiness/insomnia) and then suddenly switch to the opposite symptom after taking it for a while."
1927,"Maybe I'm seeing patterns where they don't exist, but I can't shake the feeling that my physical responses to medication occasionally fluctuate alongside my mood."
1928,"I'm currently taking these medications:

Pristiq: 100mg
Lithium: 900mg
Daily."
1929,I've always had a hard time focusing in life and I've never tried ADD medicine until recently.
1930,"END EDIT

It seems pretty obvious to me after doing some thought, research, and discussion that medication is a temporary fix for bipolar."
1931,That the meds might be making it worse.
1932,"I wonder what the medication is really doing to my brain, whether I really have the strength to endure a relapse after finally seeing what it's like to live without symptoms."
1933,Certain shows and movies were unhealthy for me when I was off my meds.
1934,Pdoc wants to see if tweaking my meds levels things out.
1935,Now to get to the point im bipolar type 2 and have been on two different medicines.
1936,The permanent one is Lamictal which ironically is an anti-seizure medication.
1937,"On top of medicine ive been under a lot of stress about many different things, even life changing events."
1938,Thus why im on medication in the first place.
1939,The medications aren't working.
1940,I don't know what else to do and I am so scared I am too petrified of what might happen if I call the health center and tell them the meds aren't helping.
1941,I'm a lot more stable then I was even a year ago now that I've found the right medication.
1942,"But whenever people go on meds in books or movies, they talk about how they go flat, lose their personality...whatever."
1943,"Find a good doctor, listen to them, take your meds and just live life people."
1944,"I'm starting to feel really validated, like I am truly smart enough to do the work like people have been telling me all these years and now that I seem to be developing the self discipline and executive function skills I can accomplish my goal of working in medicine."
1945,"Note: I don't know if he is on medication, but I would think not."
1946,Often they were induced my medication but many times they also happened naturally.
1947,All I know is that I'm super sensitive to meds so I'm unlikely to ever find a medication that helps me.
1948,I've tried every possible combination of medications there is to try (an exaggeration but only slightly).
1949,"I've decided that if I'm going to experience these symptoms regardless, I'd rather not have my personality tampered with by medications."
1950,Has anyone tried living without medications?
1951,"I came into this understanding that there will always be some side effects, and that there isn't really a ""perfect"" bipolar medication available yet."
1952,It's awesome and I wanted to share for anyone having money problems with meds.
1953,I can sleep a little better at night knowing I won't miss my meds.
1954,"That was Sept 2012, and I've been on a lot of different meds since then."
1955,"I don't want to switch medications again, because honestly bipolar-wise I feel pretty good about Abilify and lithium."
1956,She doesn't take the medication she was prescribed which was Lithium because she doesn't like the way it makes her feel.
1957,I'm tired of trying out different medications and med combos.
1958,20+ medications later and I'm just done.
1959,"When I see my psychiatrist on Monday, and she asks how my meds have been working out, all I can think about telling her is ""Fine."""
1960,I don't want her to adjust my meds.
1961,It wouldn't matter what I said about the meds anyway.
1962,"Since I started taking my medication (3 months ago) I have been episode-free, only once or twice I felt like I was *going* to have one but didn't, but last night I threw up (ate some bad food) after I took my pills and I'm guessing I threw up my pills because I had a pretty bad episode at work today."
1963,I even had my medicine but I didn't know if I could take it in the morning (the bottle says if you miss a dose take it when you remember unless it's closer to the next scheduled time.)
1964,"Right after we split, he says he went to a doctor and according to their questionnaire he fit the criteria for being bipolar but I'm not sure if he's ever been officially diagnosed or prescribed medication for it."
1965,My doctor was adamant that with my new meds I would be able to get my shit together better without it.
1966,I found out he was diagnosed with some sort of bipolar disorder 3 years ago but only took the 3 medications for a few days and went back to using heroin instead.
1967,He has an appointment with a therapist/counselor on Monday to get the referral for a psychiatrist so that we can get him on meds.
1968,*edit - Also she stopped taking all of her meds and crashed her car into a telephone pole last week.
1969,I started this medication about the same time I was expecting my period.
1970,I'm not on meds currently because I was stable for that time.
1971,"I haven't been on medicine in almost 6 months, simply because I keep forgetting, or I have no motivation to take the medicine anyways."
1972,"They should issue medals along with the steady stream of medication.”

https://underbipolarcovers.wordpress.com/2013/10/15/the-truth-carrie-fisher/"
1973,"In the meantime I'm trying to decide which of my emergency ""do not throw away"" meds I need to take."
1974,I'm not on any medication as I do not enjoy the side effects.
1975,"I need to stop, but I really don't want to get back on medication."
1976,Around 2 years ago I decided I didn't want to be controlled by medication anymore and I went off of my Lexapro.
1977,He let me know i was probably at the point of relapsing due to being off of my meds for around 2 years and this threw me off the edge.
1978,At 630 my alarm went off and I took two more 20mg of geodon and all my other meds I usually take at 730.....
1979,"That said, what should I know about the possibilities and limits of behavioral/cognitive therapy, as opposed to psychiatric medicine?"
1980,Shortly after returning to college I stopped taking the meds because fuck psychology and its been sort of a hectic year.
1981,"He is worse than I am OFF of meds, and he's a failure at many things."
1982,she had been in the hospital for quite some time and still needs her meds.
1983,Little did I know that she had stopped taking her meds weeks ago.
1984,"Alright, I know I may get a bit of hate for not taking my meds but BEAR WITH ME."
1985,"TBH second attempt was hella impulsive, honestly felt like I was daring myself so it wasn't from meds."
1986,"Anyway I am kinda inconsistent in taking meds, but not for my random Aug attempt."
1987,Started taking meds consistently/religiously mid Aug (after attempt 2014.
1988,Long distance boyfriend broke up with me (sorta mutual) Dec 28ish and haven't taken meds since.
1989,Sidenote: she sees a therapist but she refuses to start meds.
1990,I'd rather not add to my rather substantial amount of medications.
1991,Are you able to track things better or do you finally figure out the meds at some point?
1992,I am on my correct medicines (which do help) but it's not enough anymore.
1993,"He's specifically been told that he can't drink when he's taking his medication (otherwise many of the calming effects will be cancelled out), but he does anyway."
1994,"Myself and some of my extended family (aunts, cousins) have been trying to convince my parents that they need to set some sort of ultimatum for him with the drinking - if his meds worked properly and without interference, it would be a whole different ball game."
1995,"I've been doing really well on my meds for the past few months, just a few days of hypomania at times, but lately I've been finding myself not wanting to leave the house or talk to people some days."
1996,I went through the first two years entirely without medication and completely addicted to cutting.
1997,"But, despite all that, I managed to get on medication and have been clean for about 3 months now."
1998,**Edit: I should note here that I am currently unmedicated and have been for a while so there was no interference with medication.
1999,I finally make an appointment to get some meds.
2000,I've been on the meds almost a year now and my mood has been more or less stabilized.
2001,"I've been diagnosed with a lot of different things, with severe depression and anxiety, diff therapists, meds, not a lot of help."
2002,"I am pretty convinced it might be the result of side effects from the medication, even though the pharmacist said that sexual side effects were not listed as common side effects for those meds."
2003,And since i might not even be a confirmed bipolar i might be taking unneeded medication not fit for my condition.
2004,"I'm very sorry for being long winded, so here it goes:

TL;DR: Should i stop my meds or not?"
2005,I was on medication on pretty much all my high-school teenage years.
2006,"Now, ive been off medication for almost 5 years now?"
2007,"Now for the past week or so ive been having anxiety attacks, restlessness, ups and downs and all there is to it, so ive decided to go back on meds for the time being."
2008,"Ive been on medication for 2 days now, and all of sudden its all so clear to me about him and how he treats me like a complete crap, I just dont know what to do now, or sure if this sudden clarity is real or the side effects of the drugs or ive been having a manic episode all this year?"
2009,"They have me on some medication I'm trying, and I see a psychologist, and well as another person who prescribes me medication."
2010,"I don't know how that is for scale, but it's both too many pills, and not enough medicine."
2011,I finally got diagnosed and I'll get meds soon.
2012,I'm a 17 year old guy who has been diagnosed for six months now and I have been on different meds for that time too.
2013,"There comes a point in taking medication where the effects seem to fade away with the side effects and things just seem to go stable and when I reached that point I realised it was my actions that ""controlled"" my Bipolar and just general mental health and sanity."
2014,"Forgetting about my illness and resuming ""normality"" has been the greatest medication I have at the moment and I want it to stay the way it is."
2015,Then I took an antihistamine for a sinus issue that's going around and out of curiosity looked up how the medication works.
2016,I've been making sure to take my meds because I was inconsistant for a while.
2017,Anyone else get agitated easily if you don't take your meds?
2018,"Since then, I've been non-compliant with my medication."
2019,"I can't afford regular visits to a psychiatrist on top of medication, not to mention that most psychiatrists won't prescribe without talk therapy."
2020,"My medication was all changed around by my Psychiatrist, and he told me so often to cut down on the drinking."
2021,This led to my medication being hiked up in dosage on a regular basis.
2022,"This, along with the amount that I was drinking, resulted in about 10 stone of weight gain and enough medication to knock out a Horse."
2023,"They managed to safely get my off the alcohol, and started sorting my medication out."
2024,"Along with that, since I stopped drinking and my medication was sorted out properly, I managed to lose 8 stone."
2025,"I can't say if it's because I'm mourning for someone who walked out of my life a year ago, or hell, missing 1 ducking night of meds."
2026,He has a reputation at multiple hospitals for being the best psychiatrist but what he's best at is lying and that's what I've concluded is necessary for patient compliance which is a big thing in psychiatry because the meds are shit.
2027,Do you ever feel like you're taking too many meds?
2028,"I know I'm not taking a lot of meds compared to some people, but I'm taking meds for my bipolar, my inability to fall asleep, my anxiety, my back pain (from surgery), testosterone (due to having bouts with weakness that put me in the hospital a few times), asthma inhaler, asthma steroid inhaler, and my general everyday ""Ugh, I've got another headache..."" ibuprofen."
2029,"And when I get frustrated, I refuse to take my medicines and the whole thing backfires on me."
2030,Most days I ignore the alarms I set on my phone to tell me when to take my meds.
2031,"How do you motivate yourself to take all your meds, especially when you're in a depressed funk and don't really care about yourself (like I am right now)?"
2032,I take my medications regularly ( I've had a few slips over the years).
2033,I've gotten each of those in the last 9 months or so since I've been on a new medication but they've been mild and easy to deal with and haven't affected my day to day activities (aka getting shit done).
2034,"The meds I'm on have been a godsend and we probably need to up the dose, my next appt is May 5."
2035,"Since then, I've noticed that some bipolar symptoms I had before getting medicated have been creeping up, especially during those couple hours I hadn't taken my meds."
2036,"So my question is: When you're a couple of hours off on taking your meds, do you start experiencing uncontrolled bipolar symptoms you were previously free of?"
2037,My mother doesn't want me on medication and both my mother and father are so hot and cold about it all.
2038,"I am not on medication but am on a waiting list to get in with a new pdoc to get on medication but I know that it is all trial and error to find the right mix that works for you and am worried that I won't be able to function even more during this process...

Is disability and option?"
2039,I haven't been off these meds in &gt;8 years.
2040,I love the meds!!!
2041,"On top of all that, my meds keep me from really releasing any emotion."
2042,"I opened up the new-text link and wrote this, titling it, ""quitting my meds before I die""."
2043,I don't function well without meds.
2044,"However, I can't chase away the urge to quit my meds."
2045,"I could get up early in the morning, throw the day's meds away, and pretend to have taken them."
2046,"My head isn't going to leave me alone until I quit my meds, I suspect."
2047,"I have tried a number of things, meds, life-style changes, etc."
2048,She has a psychiatrist as well as a therapist and is taking her meds (both an anti-psychotic and mood stabilizer).
2049,"Indeed, in [studies done by the NIH](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17950467), there exists mounting evidence it can be utilized across many types of mood disorders for treatment as adjunct therapy with medications:
&gt;This analysis of randomized, controlled trials suggests that bright light treatment and dawn simulation for seasonal affective disorder and bright light for nonseasonal depression are efficacious, with effect sizes equivalent to those in most antidepressant pharmacotherapy trials."
2050,"Remember: as previously outlined in multiple studies, it can reduce the side effects of an existing regimen, while adding few or no side effects of its own, while also increasing the efficacy of existing medications and reducing the incidence of depressive episodes."
2051,I went to collect my meds.
2052,"The most prominent obstacles to my studies are the fogginess associated with meds, as well as communicating my thoughts on paper in a clear manner."
2053,"He has been on medication since, with little problems from the disorder."
2054,Not sure if he has still been taking his meds or if he is off them right now.
2055,"What, if any, benefits have you experienced from the combination of medication and therapy?"
2056,I guess I dont have any real questions besides what can I do to help cope with all this that is not medicine.
2057,I have a dr's appt this week to get some meds.
2058,"Back story: Been looking for a good psych for YEARS now, and I went to a new one who changed my Seroquel 150 XR because I mentioned my galactorrhea and high prolactin levels (46) He changed all of my meds without titrating my previous Seroquel prescription."
2059,i believe the medication is playing a key role.
2060,"along with powerlifting training, which is just as important as meds."
2061,"I started on my meds two months ago, relying on a 'discount card' from the grocery to cover my meds, which brought them to under 10$."
2062,"*Now I'm broke, getting close to running out of meds the week of Christmas with no telling what might happen if I can't get something worked out."
2063,I suffer from bipolar disorder (diagnosed) and have been curious to see what type of medication treatments others have been on.
2064,"I started a new medication a few weeks ago, and after a week or so I felt really good, not manic, just better."
2065,I want to stop taking my meds.
2066,This fucking rapid cycling was never a thing before I started taking meds.
2067,"I HATE anytime anyone has ever said, ""I think there is something wrong with your meds."""
2068,"You know I posted to another redditor yesterday about #1 not feeling so bad over things she may say or due while manic and #2 I also told her not to fall into the trap of using bipolar illness as an excuse for what you may say or do when not manic


Just like #2, I think this husband of mine was blaming bipolar meds on something he didn't like about my choice of words, my crying, my attitude."
2069,I'm not currently on any medication but I know I should be.
2070,I know there are meds that will help me get out of  this funk and back to a more stable state but I'm afraid of going back on antidepressants.
2071,What was the biggest change you noticed after starting your medication?
2072,I just had an adverse side effect to some of the medications I was taking.
2073,I never stay on my meds because they usually make me sick.
2074,to be honest I still want to kill people while on the meds.
2075,I have tried almost 15 different meds over the past year and they have either had disastrous or no effects.
2076,"Did you relapse, and if so, how long were you off your meds before it happened?"
2077,What medications are you currently on?
2078,"Well, I was prescribed medication."
2079,"...So since meds won't work for me, am I stuck like this?"
2080,"I suffered from bipolar disorder since around age 8, got diagnosed at 19, and have struggled to find the right balance of meds since then (which I finally have after 4 years."
2081,Now that I know for sure that I am I can get proper meds and work on managing my symptoms.
2082,"I am scared to change any of my medications because they have helped me a lot, so I'm thinking about adding an antidepressant."
2083,I stuck to my medication and it has worked!
2084,And the medication I wanted to try and would be most comfortable starting off with would be Lamictal.
2085,"I'd say, though, that on medication my dreams are toned down compared to what they used to be like."
2086,"I also didn't sleep well on it, so that didn't become a regular medication."
2087,"I'd love to hear about any stories, mechanisms, rituals, supplements, or even meds that help you all through anger."
2088,"I was kinda diagnosed bipolar 2 in october(kinda meaning he said I probably have it, and that I should research it, but he didn't want to put me on any medications yet)."
2089,"I called and made an appointment for january to look into meds, but for the past week I've felt pretty stable and now I feel stupid for wanting medications because I feel fine at this moment."
2090,"I guess this might have been a vent, or maybe a way to see if anyone else felt this way before talking to the doctor about meds?"
2091,Today my shrink said I was stable enough and started me back on my ADHD medication (I am so stoked about this!)
2092,and all my other meds are working.
2093,It seems like scrapping all the other meds and starting over was a good move.
2094,"My dad also gave me back control of all my meds back at home, so I am trusted again."
2095,For people who used to feel apathetic what medication made the apathy go away for you?
2096,I'm weirdly sensitive to or react differently to most medications.
2097,I cannot afford more medication I take my prozac and if I take it every day I do a lot better than normally.
2098,When I got into community college I started dealing with very ignorant people who think mental illness is fake and controllable without medication.
2099,"The ex I was fighting with is one of those people, has actually said to my face that I can control my issues without medication if I try hard enough."
2100,I need to find a way to control my bipolar without medication or therapy.
2101,I can't wait for the meds to kick in and for me to find a proper therapist.

2103,I've been trying different meds in different combinations and doses for almost 10 years.

2106,She refuses to speak about her meds.
2107,I didn't like my personality while I was on my meds.
2108,I've taken medication for both which I stopped because I hate medication.
2109,My psychiatrist doesn't know what it is or how it interacts with medications.
2110,"He's been on medication now for three months, and his pdoc recently (a few days ago) said the meds seemed to be working pretty well and that he appeared fairly stable."
2111,"Bipolar ll in remission (no meds and healthy over 3 years) 

I've recently started smoking thinking it would be a nice relaxing way to chill out."
2112,My doctor wants me to go on meds.
2113,"What's some other non medication ways of coping, and as people with bipolar who are on meds what are your experiences with and opinions of them?"
2114,I was treated with 5+ medications and after 4 months of hospitalization and severe psychosis I went back home to start the recovery process.
2115,I reached out to the office of students with disabilities and got someone to take notes for me due to my hands shaking from medication side effects.
2116,"I've been on anti depressants, anxiety meds, and recently bi polar meds."
2117,I can switch moods at the drop of a hat except being on meds so long has killed my emotions.
2118,But I think I'll have to discontinue and start a new medication.
2119,"I really like being on a medication that hasn't made me gain weight and that doesn't impact my sleep, but this cognitive deficit is getting to be overwhelming."
2120,Has anyone tried any other medications and had success?
2121,tl;dr: I've been on most bipolar meds and can't find one that works.
2122,Following jail and court ordered medication (lithium) I have gotten control of my life enough to move forward again.
2123,"So pretty much this fear-mongering bitch mental health/support worker called up my Mum this morning, and warned her that at this stage if I go off my medication I may go into another eppisode and 'Never snap out of it'- Because my case was so rare."
2124,Will the medication 'fix' this?
2125,"Well I've been having hypermanic episodes the past couple of months and I'm in the middle of one right now, or so I'm told, and my meds aren't leveling out my moods and my mind is racing constantly."
2126,So basically I came to this sub to see if anyone has advice other than medications for handling a manic episode.
2127,"I'm new to the meds, about two weeks in, and previously I have attempted suicide, cut myself wildly, picked fights with everyone around me, and spent all my money on useless shit when I had bills to pay."
2128,"I am on a handful of meds because I have other chronic conditions, too."
2129,It wasn't for months of trying meds and extensive therapy that he was finally stable and had the right mix of meds.
2130,How hard is it to make yourself take your meds?
2131,"I went to the doc today to get an adjustment on my meds because things have been kind of ""off"" lately, only to find out the pharmacy had been filling my presriptions at half strength."
2132,I stopped taking meds after that.
2133,"I've been as down as I can be on my meds, and I've been trying hard to shake it, and well you know how it is."
2134,"If I don't take my meds' (forget, or the whole ""I don't want to move, and they're over there, so I'll try again tomorrow"") it kinda gets over whelming, but I guess that's sorta the nature of it all."
2135,I'm currently back on meds (starting back in November) after 2 years without them.
2136,These episodes often came with days or even weeks of complete memory loss which led to Dr.s to diagnosing me with mixed-bipolar and start exploring medications.
2137,I ended up in the hospital due to one extreme episode and ever since have been on various multiple meds to keep my hallucinations and episodes under control.
2138,My friend was off their meds I'm not sure for how long but I'm certain it was a long period.
2139,They said that after a while a certain medicine has no effect on them.
2140,"So I had my suspicions and they turned out to be correct, they weren't on medicine."
2141,However should my friend want to keep living at home they would have to take the meds.
2142,My friend said the meds would dull her emotions and take away the ability to feel.
2143,I've known them for 7 years when they were on medicine but what she describes sounds nothing like what she was like even 4 years ago.
2144,I've run the gamut of medications.
2145,"I get stressed out about something, I proceed to ruminate so it doesn't remit and I don't take anything for it because I don't think it's bad enough to warrant meds, the stress triggers hypomanic symptoms, I finally take a Klonopin so it doesn't escalate from there, the benzo in addition to my other meds does the trick but then I end up in a funk and then the depression makes the anxiety worse and the whole fucking thing starts over again."
2146,I've only been taking medication because I live in a small town and there isn't a therapist near me that'll take people without insurance *and* do sliding scale payment.
2147,"I get my meds free from the county MHMR program, which is good because I couldn't afford treatment at all otherwise."
2148,I know that meds alone don't cut it.
2149,I was wondering if any of you have traveled abroad for long periods of time and how you obtained your medications there.
2150,I want to go to Costa Rica for a year to teach English but I don't know if I will be able to obtain my meds down there (especially Adderall - when I studied abroad in Colombia they don't have any stimulants to treat ADHD... they put me on Strattera which didn't work and made me so sleepy that I couldn't even go to class).
2151,"I feel like before meds my sex drive was overactive (I'm female, just for reference)."
2152,"So the point is, while these meds haven't eliminated my sex drive in any way, they help to take off that aggressive edge sometimes."
2153,"Must have meds to feel that way, feel depressed upon waking up."
2154,"Became much more manic, but not completely, without the anxiety meds to tranquilize me.|Self: At this point I become oddly extraverted and manic, my mind starts racing more."
2155,"Didn't want to do that, so I tried to get both medications from mom with a knife (to make her know I seriously need it) (!!"
2156,"Due to paperwork they don't get me medication until the end of my stay, where I have a panic attack (Just the stress of being there, it's a shitty place and I don't have a private room) and start shaking uncontrollably until I bit my lips and bled."
2157,"After the panic attack they transfer me to hospital #1|No meds until panic attack.|I didn't even see a psychologist, fucking useless hospital."
2158,"First 2 days at H. #1|Hospital 1's staff conflicted with me alot, wouldn't let me into my treatment info and wouldn't let me sign consent forms for medication."
2159,"Rest of stay (2 days)|I go back on Zoloft and anxiety medication, but I decide to reject the anxiety meds."
2160,"This was the first time I realized I may be manic, my weekend doctor observed this in me but didn't know if I was bipolar or it was the meds."
2161,"I reject the anxiety meds, but couldn't get Xanax for as-needed upon release.|Still Maj. Dep and General Anxiety, but I may be bipolar."
2162,"Today, morning|Serious suicidal ideations in the morning (first time since hospital stay #1), then take meds and become hypermanic and close to inconherent, a serious basketcase."
2163,"The next day I decided I felt totally fine, better than fine, stopped taking any medication whatsoever and was pretty sky high for a while, in a really good mood, back to being a functioning teenager."
2164,"Then I crashed and tried to kill myself, had an overall very bad time, got in trouble with the police a little bit, and refused outright to ever take meds again."
2165,"I went back on meds, Citalopram this time (although dropped it when I felt fine)."
2166,"Before it was always a case of, I would wake up and feel great one day, drop meds, drop therapy and then be fine for a while then crash and need it get it back."
2167,"At this point I was taking sertraline for anxiety I had been feeling before, but that had all gone now and I came off the meds, and I was feeling really good."
2168,Also I am aware my reaction to drop meds and therapy when I feel better is unhealthy.
2169,I am pretty convinced i have some other co-existing illness^foot so my pdoc said keep a mood chart and talk to her after i let the meds kick in a bit.
2170,I started getting curious about bipolar as I noticed when I'm not on meds I will go from feeling low to doing stupid things like charging a $1000 laptop or change jobs on a whim.
2171,I'm convinced I don't have it though and don't take meds for that anymore.
2172,I almost want to ditch meds altogether and pray for the best.
2173,Six months into the relationship she experiences her first mixed episode (several months after a medication step-down) and rips me new ones emotionally and socially.
2174,"Her meds were stepped back up (Lamictal), but she had weekly issues with missing doses before and after the episode."
2175,"The messiness reaches unbearable levels at times (I have a bad habit of enabling and picking up after her), when her ADD meds wear off it’s literally like a kid in a candy store, hyper and uncontrolled with some violence."
2176,I'm on heavy duty sleep medication...
2177,"We're all familiar with medications that are supposed to help us, but make us gain weight."
2178,I'm on better meds now anyway!
2179,"I was diagnosed bipolar a few months ago and I'm on Escitalopram and Lithium now, feel pretty stable when I take it but I've got a pretty messy life (and I'm ADHD as well, so I'm all over the place) so I forget to take my meds pretty often, I've realized that when I do that I'll go manic, which I enjoy of course."
2180,"Edit

I ended up taking an over dose on Lorazepam cause I needed my mind to calm the fuck down, I thought my neighbor was stalking me and locked myself into my room.. Just got out of hospital after 2 days, I think I'll stick to taking my medicines from now on, thanks guys!"
2181,But he has back up plans if the medicines are too strong for me.
2182,Are you on medication?
2183,"- suicide prevention
- when is the right/wrong time to ""talk about it""
- changing medication
- coercion into therapy (again)
- communicating through mania

- dealing with my own frustration
- when not to just ""let it slide""
- dealing with him blaming me
- dealing with my guilt about doing the wrong thing sometimes"
2184,I want to stop my meds.
2185,Treated with medication in 2009.
2186,Stopped taking meds.
2187,Had a very long mixed episode up until I decided to go back on meds a few months ago.
2188,"Before I went off my meds, I was taking 225 mg of welbutrin (non xl) and 200 mg of lamictal."
2189,"My question is, do you think my age, time off drugs, smoking and/or drinking/drug abuse influenced changes in regards to my meds?"
2190,Tl;dr: current meds aren't working.
2191,"do you think age, time off drugs(~3 years), drug/alcohol/nicotine abuse, will influence current medication needs?"
2192,Then when talked about my ADHD meds and my driving.
2193,At the time he only had me on my meds four days of the week - the days I worked.
2194,But the days I didn't take my meds and drove I got in accidents.
2195,My shrink doubled my sleep medicine but I only took half yesterday because had to be up early today.
2196,"I feel like I can't and I feel the depression coming, and the suicidal thoughts....

TL;DR Shrink intimidates me, changes meds; therapist talks to him to clear some things up."
2197,Cause I REALLY like this medication.
2198,I'm now trying meds and doing therapy which is going great.
2199,"If you're on any kind of medication for bipolarism, what is it and how has it affected you.. negatively or positively?"
2200,Is there any kind of alternative treatments besides therapy and medication?
2201,I'm on the right meds now so that won't happen.
2202,"I was on a low dose of bipolar medication for a while, but I decided to stop it."
2203,Below is what I experienced along with the medicines I was on and dosage.
2204,I believe in medicine.
2205,"I don't really like taking my meds because I feel as if they inhibit my creativity, but when I get into a low I get extremely paranoid."
2206,Are there anyone who manages to cope with bipolar well without being on meds?
2207,"Im really worried that he'll never go on medication, keep blaming others, and in short just go on to treat someone else as badly as he treated me."
2208,Any advice on anything possible to do to get him to try meds / check if he really might benefit from them?
2209,"From what Ive read its possible to live well with bipolar if you just get the right help/medication/treatment, and its so sad to see someone go through life this way."
2210,"*

I've been on medication for years now."
2211,It's been 3 years since I started the medication.
2212,"I've tried several different medications, my psychiatrist and I have been close for the whole period trying to get my treatment just right but I don't feel it's amounting to anything."
2213,"So despite the first half of this story, I'm thinking about going off my medication and instead concentrating on CBT or a likewise form of treatment."
2214,"**TL;DR, My bipolar history+ in a nutshell and I'm considering moving away from medication and concentrating on therapy treatments."
2215,I ran out of one of my meds a few weeks ago and have been feeling fine until recently.
2216,"Even if I could find one, I don't have the money for the appointment or meds."
2217,"Me, 34 yo, long history of depression, finally diagnosed BPII around 7 years ago, struggled with meds, finally found the right combination 4 years ago."
2218,"Before finding the right meds, I was so anxious and depressed I -never- left my home."
2219,"Learning to live again with my new meds, I started to enjoy life, I can now travel, move around, I have friends, a job, a place, a boyfriend ..."
2220,"My meds : depakine 500, abilify 5mg, paroxetine 20 

Anyone feels like this ?"
2221,"After quite the interesting upswing yesterday (worked, went to the chiropractor, refilled meds, bought groceries, and then went on a 7 mile walk with a super huge smile on my face because everything was beautiful) most likely induced by lack of sleep, I managed to get 10 hours of sleep last night."
2222,"And this morning, while I was still calm, before I had coffee or my morning meds, I realized I had not showered in 4 days."
2223,I think cutting down on alcohol was a big help in stabilizing my mood and getting my meds to actually work.
2224,I'm tired of new medication and adjusting them.
2225," I have been taking lithium for one year, and although it is the only medication that has had *any* effect in controlling my disease, it has also been the source of great suffering."
2226,"I'm going to an intensive outpatient program for the mentally ill 5 times a week, trying to fill my time and improve my thinking while I wait and wait and wait and wait to find a combo of meds that works."
2227,"She has a tendency to stop taking her medication through forgetfulness that means she misses a day, then another, which usually results in her eventually stopping."
2228,"I do my best to be supportive, and asked if she was willing to delegate reminder responsibility for her medication to me, and she was/has done so."
2229,"I can sometimes see it coming, where I know she's getting more distant but have felt weird about just saying ""are you still taking your meds?"""
2230,"As I said, there are times when I see improvement based on habits, as opposed to just medication, which to my understanding is more about making the bipolar manageable for her."
2231,"I regularly take my prescribed medications and even omega 3 pills, just like the doctor says."
2232,One of the few things I feel like is holding me back (in a sense) in life after being diagnosed is the difficulty of getting and regulaly taking meds abroad.
2233,My therapist says if I lived in place like this I could just get the meds shipped to me every few months.
2234,(I'm terrible at any medication).
2235,"I've been to so many different therapists and tried so many meds, but I'm too inconsistent to keep up with medicine and you can't just go on and off lamictal like I do all the time."
2236,Is it possible that my medication isn't doing the job?
2237,However I have started to add the [Medication Master list](http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/wiki/medicationmasterlist) (thanks to /u/miscreantpossum for mentioning that the list was archived) to the wiki as of today and the wiki is now open to everyone else for viewing (it has always been open to mods).
2238,"It seems the right medication, not Jesus, will save me from myself."

2244,"Afraid to up my meds while my brain is being ""shifty""."
2245,"After the objective creation of modern medicine after the Napoleonic wars it no longer treated vague subjective descriptions of ailments, like the patient had red spots on their arm, but rather found the commonalities between sufferers in order to be able to use what cured one to help another, lacerations along the sinister antebrachium suggest steroidal treatments."
2246,"For bipolar disorder it seems as though everything can effect it, exercise, sleep, nutrition, relationships, stress and what doctors give us, medication."

2252,"I go to a therapist every two weeks and get psychotherapy with my psychiatrist when I see her, but I haven't told anyone I'm off my meds."
2253,I'm going back on my meds and titrating my Lamictal again.
2254,"Anyway, she recently started taking much more of a certain medication than she had been taking, and that was when all of this started."
2255,Could this be something more than just the medication?
2256,TL;DR: Would you take medicine that killed/removed an important part of your personality if it made you stable?
2257,"I used to have art and engineering projects outside of work, but have been unable to do anything like that since I've been on this medicine."
2258,My meds are going from 60 total to over 100 for a bare minimum of the three I absolutely have to have.
2259,"But also I'm mad because the ""treatments"" for schiz used to be: hand crank drill to the head, lobotomy(surgery cutting out the brain), shock torture, drugging and locking up... but scientists cant even cure a common cold with medicine."

2261,"and she says she is having a hard time as an excuse and now we'll have her sister tell her much it suck to take meds and how it's not cool to be a nutter!"""

2263,"I guess what I'm trying to say is, my life is awesome now, my medication works, I live somewhere (far, far away) in a place I love, I feel put together, and while bad days exist, they exist like they do for normal people."

And how dangerous do you think drinking on these meds are."
2266,reading these stories and what happens with meds and everything.

2273,Is it possible to still go through the highs and lows of my bipolar disorder when on my medication?

2284,New shrink and we discussed meds and I agreed wanting to be off Effexor because I am also on Wellbutrin.
2285,"The only reason I still have medication is because my pharmacy got a a phone app and it had listed all the medications I forgot to refill, and I had gotten so far ahead that they've been enough to cover this gap, but now we're getting to the line where I'm soon going to be completely out."
2286,I need to make a change to my meds.
2287,"At what point do I need to put into writing exactly what problems I'm having, and explain to a fucking psychiatric clinic what Bipolar disorder is, and how it and my medications have directly affected my sleep to the point of missing doctor's appointments and being late to work, or missing nights of sleep?"
2288,"We don't know how to treat this combination, I'm obviously not the only one but she has absolutely nothing to go off of and we've just been throwing medications at them to see if there's anything at all that would treat both effectively."
2289,"Bipolar medications have sleep side effects, sleep medications have mood side effects..."

2291,"On the sleep side of meds I've tried light therapy for long periods, melatonin, modafinil (I turned into the undead), Zopiclone (for six months which is extremely dangerous but luckily didn't cause an addiction) and currently use a small dose of Quetiapine but it's beginning to not work."
2292,I tried medications to deal with the depression before all of that happened.
2293,I tried 10 different medications before giving up completely.
2294,"So after explaining that that's what I need to be happy, he says that I change my mind every 10 minutes about what will make me happy, and said I should get back on medication."

2296,"So the affection, the medication, the poly, everything has been created and taken away by this disease."
2297,I've been back on the meds and struggle with taking them daily.
2298,"I have been on and off medication since then and while not exactly stable, I haven't gone off the deep end completely in the times I was unmedicated, thankfully."

2309,Is there a way where I could skip a day of medication if I know I will drink that night or is that dangerous as well?
2310,"However, I need to get my medication today."
2311,I *need* my medication today.
2312,I was recently re diagnosed with ADHD and am worried that the meds that I am prescribed (Ritalin and Ritalin La) may be destabilizing my mood.
2313,I want to know if this is just because I am bipolar or my medication?
2314,"Within the past year or so, I began to eat at least one to two meals a day again, and then more recently have been working on my medication balance."
2315,Now on medication and my mother &amp; sisters (also my only family and a huge support system for me) are telling me it's all in my head and im just being dramatic..
2316,"He is on medication (seroquel, clonipin, and ambien for sleep)."
2317,He has not skipped his meds and I can see no precipitating factors other than alchol but that is not always a constant variant.
2318,"I tried out six different therapists and four different medications, including varying doses of Lexapro and Prozac (which gave me a tic that presents during panic attacks)."

2321,"Needless to say, panicked and concerned during a low period I went in to get help and he switched my medications again dropping the dose of the antidepressant and putting me on a mood stabilizer and we're trying to figure out how I'm doing, but I feel like 90% of my visits have been on working out medication, and that he hasn't spend any time really figuring out whats wrong with me."
2322,"And frankly the more I think about it, the more I'm sure I might be bipolar, and I'm not sure the medications I'm on now are working."
2323,"If I understand correctly, a therapist is more of a casual thing to help you sort out your problems, a psychologist is a therapist that will help you diagnose disorders, and a psychiatrist will prescribe you medications for those disorders?"

2325,"I've never spent more than 15 minutes with a pdoc at a time so I don't trust that they are really, truly tailoring my meds to my particular situation."
2326,"I'm on my medication, I have a great diet, and I regularly see my therapist yet somehow I still feel dead inside."

2329,"the thing is, the same time i was on clozaril i also had a seizure (due to that lovely medication) and fell down the stairs and got a pretty bad concussion on my forehead so i'm not sure (that was in 2010)

my head feels odd, that stuff was 5 million times more powerful than geodon and risperdal."
2330,Apparently I'm sensitive to medicines: the antidepressant at a low dose would make melt me into the sofa all day.
2331,I am currently on Seroquel and Prozac to manage my mood but i still felt this disconnection even before i stared taking medication.

2337,"They talk of switching my medicines (to latuda, etc), but they want months of stability first (which I have had)."

2364,"This recent summer I thought I had the bipolar beaten, as in without medication I was feeling pretty good."
2365,"Maybe five solid months of feeling pretty good, little if any genuine medications and most certainly no medicinal routine."
2366,I didn't start taking medication (I'm on Lithium right now) until just a few weeks ago.
2367,"There's a huge gap between my diagnosis and when I started meds because I wanted to see if I could handle myself knowing that I was bipolar, like I was testing myself to see if I could be ""normal"" without medication."
2368,"I know you just want to help :D 

I stopped taking my medication about two months ago and it has become fairly clear that I really should be on it (I guess I kinda knew that the whole time.)"
2369,"Does the fact that I didn't develop it while staging in, nor when I quite cold turkey (I know, bad bad bad) imply that I am not at risk; or is it a risk *every* time you start the medication?"

2379,"I've been talking with a friend who a diagnosis of Bipolar (and has found the right cocktail of meds for her...so big shout-out to her), and it's been helping me to recognize that I've had the paranoia (treatment was going to kill me, self-help books were cult literature stealing my money), and mania (feeling like I knew all of the secrets of the world/feeling like I had to write a book so that humanity could be saved by my wise words, along with recurring needs to move from NY to California for the sole reason that I would end up a blissfully happy artist/semi homeless person)."
2380,"I guess it's just confusing, because I am not sure what to say to a meds person to take me seriously."
2381,"It's just confusing now, because I'm expressing to my therapist, hey I'm getting reaallllllyyyy suicidal, I set up appointments with a medical group thingy (they do meds, groups, counselling all in one place), and they're all just telling me to kind of just hang in there, promising not to hurt myself."
2382,"I dunno, I guess that I just want to write this out, to get it out, and get perspective, but it seems like the best option is to go to the hospital, deal with the semi-gross conditions, get meds, and then wait for appointments to start kicking in."

2386,"So I have no meds, but I want them."

2388,We've seen each other three times but we broke up in September after she stopped taking her medications and was manic.
2389,I am wondering if this is from my medication or e result of my manic episode?

2391,She has only consistently been okay when she stays on meds.
2392,The headache and dizziness are pretty normal for me with starting new meds but the neck and back pain is pretty bad.
2393,"She has gained about 16 pounds since starting meds and is obviously upset by this, seeing as she fought very hard to lose LOTS of weight and was successful, before her diagnosis of BP 1."
2394,"So I'm very glad I sought help, but I also don't want to be on meds forever."

2404,My doctor even advised I stop taking my anti-anxiety/anti-depressant meds so I did (I was on 15mg lexapro).

* Was there actually anything wrong with me?"

I have been one various medicines and dosages for severe depression and anxiety for 7-8 years now, effexor, paxil, ciprolex and now pristiq."

2418,My medication journey began in 2010/2011 with a diagnosis of anxiety and depression.
2419,"Where my (awful) pdoc fits into this is that she asks me all these questions about medications I've been on in the past and my symptoms since I was a teenager, and I can't answer them."
2420,"I have been in the battle to find the right medication and quite frankly, I think I am losing."
2421,"I am scared of trying again, too many times have I gotten my hopes up about a medication and ultimately need to start over."
2422,"Finding the right medication, the right combination and finally the proper dosage seems utterly impossible."

2470,"The last time we spoke about how he was feeling, he mentioned briefly that he was working on trying to get off of his meds, which concerns me."
2471,"I definitely don't want to overstep boundaries and advise against him stopping his meds, especially since I don't know the situation or if he's spoken with his doctor about it."
2472,"Hey,
I was diagnosed with BPII about a year ago and underwent several treatments (mostly medication) until I was rediagnosed with rapid cycling."
2473,I just had surgery so I've had a hard time keeping up with my medication.
2474,We won't have insurance...can't afford my medicine or my therapist.
2475,All my daughter knows at 8 years old is that I have to take meds for my brain and sometimes I'm sad.
2476,Went on meds.
2477,I need to know if I need to make a new appointment or stick to my meds for now.
2478,"I have been experiencing this for a while, but I assumed I was just getting adjusted to my medication."
2479,I cannot afford more doctors and medication.
2480,I want to try a new medication but my doc has declined me multiple times.
2481,I have been to my psychiatrist meds were increased and added etc.
2482,The year following my last stay was the last time I was on any sort of medication: 1800mg of Lithium and 10mg of Zyprexa.
2483,"Seroquel has by far, with Lithium a close second, the most effective medication I have ever taken."
2484,"With the support of my medication doctor, therapist and parents, I ended therapy and eased myself off medication."
2485,"This means I couldn't get on medication when I wanted to, and quite frankly should have."
2486,She agreed to pay for the appointment and medication out of pocket.
2487,"I'm hoping a good overdose of Vitamin D, combined with medication for the first time in three years, will do my mood some good."
2488,"I hope the next time I come off medication, I can have an even longer symptom-free streak than before."
2489,"I hope to finally start and finish school on medication, a feet I have attempted too many times for my own good that ended in a fiery failure of dropping out."
2490,I'm real sick of these meds.
2491,Maybe I should try other meds?
2492,It's always hell switchin meds.
2493,I need more medicine.
2494,"I'm mostly curious, as thus far this is not nearly bad enough to make me drop one/both of these medications, which have worked very well for me."
2495,I've been on and off medication for the majority of my adult life.
2496,"In 2010, I went back into therapy and got on medication."
2497,"I had a goal to go back to college in the Fall of 2011, so I wanted to be stable on medication before that sort of undertaking."
2498,"In the meantime, my medication and therapy weren't doing much to help me."
2499,"Somewhere in the middle of graduating and the shit falling apart with the band, I had stopped taking medication for that very reason."
2500,"Surely some of this was added by my lifestyle, but I saw a 50lb increase from the last cocktail of medication."
2501,"Past few days and weeks I've been getting worse even on my meds, my mood swings have stabilized somewhat and same with hearing voices, but I recently started hallucinating at night."
2502,"I do have all my times of calling in sick documented, my meds are obviously documented, and my psychiatrist should have documented when I've self-harmed, other symptoms of mania and depression, and how I responded to meds (I'm currently trying my 5th one!)"
2503,"So I was diagnosed with mild type 2 Bipolar, and she gave me a list of meds I could research and I have to choose one."
2504,"I changed jobs after five years, changed meds, changed my treatment team, moved, its been a year with a lot of upheaval."
2505,"and he said ""I don't have an answer for you"" and prescribed bipolar meds."
2506,"It all started when I was pretty young, my mom would take me to the psychiatrist, he would suggest some meds, my mom would come up with scary ideas about them and advise me against taking them, saying they'll screw me up permanently especially that I'm a teenager and that they don't work."
2507,"Fast forward to when I can make my own medical decisions, I'm starting to get bad again but I can get meds myself now."
2508,"tl;dr - My mom put ideas into my head that I can't get rid of, that meds don't work and mess you up."
2509,I heard from a mom of a friend with bipolar 1 that the girl must take her meds because being manic and or depressed causes brain injury and that prevents it.
2510,"And about neuro protective meds, how do we know?"
2511,I feel considerably better now in terms of my mental health thanks to the help I sought from medicine.
2512,"I found out yesterday she tried to commit suicide Monday night, and stopped taking her medication some time ago."
2513,Things like Obama and the Pope are telling her to stop taking her medicine.
2514,She's back in after 4 months of taking her medicine with relative frequency.
2515,"(About getting to the doctor, taking her meds, or not doing illegal things.)"
2516,How does medication feel?
2517,"I don't want to have to deal with side effects of medications nor do I want it to ""change me."""
2518,"My depression has of course returned, and I now feel torn between two options: 

On one hand, I want to face life on its own terms and learn to live and work with my depression without medication."
2519,"But I do have a tremendous and perhaps irrational desire to face down my depression without medication, to get as I said before my ""soul"" back."
2520,"She still is in that state.. prob not staying at home, and not taking her meds."
2521,"Hey, I am having problems in deciding what emotion is real, what is bipolar, what is medication induced, and what is caused by booze."
2522,"They halted all treatment, medications, contacts."
2523,"I work about ten hours a day during the week and take my meds like clockwork, but I still gotta crash Friday after work and can't get out of bed for 24 hours."
2524,".. she's (w/ her Dr.) adjusting her meds a little this week, and is in the pms phase of things also ... she's come slightly off the rails, and is ready to send an email to quit her job over what is possibly a trivial issue... how can i best say ""honey you are PMSing and in a med adjustment please wait 48 hours before making serious life choices""?"
2525,"Then I feel mentally manic and fidgety for an hour or so, after that I feel low until I take my medicine again."
2526,"I've tried different meds, with no result."
2527,"Just some background on my dailies:
&amp;nbsp;

* Lamictal
* Latuda
* Xanax
* Melatonin (to help me sleep)

&amp;nbsp;

I took all of these meds at 10pm just like every night."
2528,"I'm afraid that because I'm hypomanic, I powered through my (sleep) meds and will be awake all night."
2529,I was really bad about taking my meds for a few weeks.
2530,"I was diagnosed bipolar at age 13 (Mom and sister both are, too, so wasn't a huge surprise), and after almost a decade of working through it without medication, I'm now working with my doctors to start looking at anti-anxiety/anti-depressant meds."
2531,I'm scared of taking a medicine that might not work or even make it worse.
2532,"So long story short, I was just hoping to hear some stories/advice/tips/anything about you guys' transitions into taking medication for bipolar and finding the right one(s)."
2533,"Doesn't have to be all sunshine and rainbow stories, just want to (1) not feel so alone in being more scared about this than hopeful and positive and (2) reinforce to myself that medication can do a lot of good and I'm not going through this for nothing."
2534,"I've gone to my psychiatrist about it and he just said ""There really aren't any anxiety medications"" and that he wouldn't prescribe Xanax to a teenager when my mother suggested it (although that was when I was 17 and I am 18 right now, I'm not sure if he'd consider that any different)."
2535,"I've been taking my meds regularly, sleeping like a normal person, and managing my depressions far better than I used to."
2536,"Pdoc will probably up my meds again, which I don't know if that's a good thing or not."
2537,I haven't been taking my meds.
2538,"Take my meds they'll tell me if I ask for help, someone to sit with me here in my head as I babble out loud."
2539,You take those fucking meds.
2540,I returned to therapy and meds last month and it seems like I'm feeling fine for several days now.
2541,"i'm on medications and, as long as i'm compliant with them, i don't have the constant suicidal thoughts."
2542,About six years ago I stopped all meds by my own choice.
2543,I'm on the journey of finding the right medication; I'm getting very burnt out.
2544,"I'm very lucky that my therapist is an APN, and so once a week she has collaborative hours with a psychiatrist where she can prescribe medications (in some states APNs don't need to collar., where I'm from they do)."
2545,"This is excellent, in my opinion, since she knows a lot of the ins and outs of what goes on in my head and what medications would be helpful."
2546,"I know full well everyone reacts differently to every medication, which is why i want to hear everything."
2547,I was prescribed to this particular medication following a serious traumatic brain injury in 2010 to help control by ADHD and stabilize my mood.
2548,"I was put on Seroquel, and that medication is where I really started to waver on being consistent with medication."
2549,"The effort I put into trying new medications, schedules, goals, and doctors and therapists is starting to seem really effing pointless."
2550,"I'm assuming (based on posts I've read) that other people experience this crap...but other than my psych switching my meds around, I don't really have any clue what to do to fix it."
2551,"Shortly after that, my x who had been seeing her own therapist although I don't think she was ever diagnosed with anything or took meds, got a promotion finally after 4 years at work."
2552,Then probably a month later I was off my medicines for like 5 days because I was sick of them.
2553,Takes her medication correctly and regularly sees psych and admits herself to hospital when suicidal.
2554,He's very stubborn and I feel like trying to get him to try medication would just make him angry or he'd just dismiss it.
2555,I worked really hard with my therapist and never skip my meds.
2556,"I still have depressive states, though not a severe as before starting meds."
2557,Certain meds that go with Bipolar NOS?
2558,"So he threw many meds at me, such as lithium, abilify, trazadone, and trileptal."
2559,"The point is, these medications did not really help me because I was mostly having depressive episodes."
2560,"I stopped taking my meds for a few months because I was having really bad brain fog, which led me to have depressive episodes mixed with borderline personality episodes (if there even is episodes for that.)"
2561,"He took me off lithium and prescribed me on Wellbutrin for depression, smoking and weight loss, also keeping the same other medications but raising the doses."
2562,"Without my medications I was starting to feel really pissy, sad and nervous."
2563,"I haven't encountered any bad side effects yet, so this might be the medication for me !!!"
2564,Currently her meds are set at 12.5mg Lamictal and 75mg Zoloft.
2565,She's extremely medication-sensitive--especially when drowsiness or nausea are listed side effects.
2566,Included in the list of meds that would be metabolized quickly was lamictal).
2567,Crazymeds.us is down so I can't readily find the answer.
2568,"Yesterday my mother scheduled an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist even though I was feeling healthy and ready to start the day, I agreed I needed new meds but asked my parents if we can reschedule for today or tomorrow because I was very busy."
2569,"They called the police and I was detained and taken to the hospital, reason being that I came off my meds without a professional's opinion."
2570,"I'm trying my best to stay on track (meds, psychiatrist, psychologist) but my parents say I'm crazy and don't try to fix it at all."
2571,"I am so resistant to meds and for some reason, I just thought I would be a lot worst without it."
2572,"(The Poem about Society in the style of 'Omega - by : Stone Sour')
	10 – Stability (Big Happy Ending, About Wanting to help others, being responsible with medication, Experiencing everything not just bad and great) 

The possiblbility of two to three bonus tracks aswell, one was a dubstep song I was working on called ""The Weaver Position"" - which is more of a cinematic action movie theme named and styled around the correct way to hold and fire a hand gun, Also because my last name is Weaver."
2573,"i went into a wild psychosis and got a 5150, 10day inpatient, meds, etc, and everything."
2574,"I’m asking myself if I should start taking medicine more-and-more lately, but I haven’t thought about that in about a year and a half and honestly didn’t need it."
2575,"Hey guys, I know I'm an idiot but

Yesterday I got high after I took my meds (Lithium, Trileptal and Zinc) and about 30 minutes after I had a seizure-like episode in the kitchen."
2576,After that I learned my lesson and figured I shouldn't be smoking weed on my meds.
2577,I feel as if those few days were because I'm finally on the right meds and I will be completely stable eventually soon but does anyone have any advice on how to get to that stable 100%?
2578,It's me the one who wanted to quit all meds.
2579,"That ""did you take your meds today"" comment is thrown around a lot, as well as ""seems like your meds are finally working"" whenever there hasn't been a fight."
2580,I had to stop taking my meds over a year ago because they stopped working and I have no insurance to re-visit the doctor to get new meds.
2581,I am an older female with type 1 who has been getting treatment for several years now and is more or less on a stable meds cocktail.
2582,Now that i'm in college I've stopped all of that and from the meds I've gained about 45 pounds.
2583,"""Are you on medication?"""
2584,Having gone to see a psychiatrist I get to add another medication.
2585,"* That being said, it's hard every time I have to decide whether or not to take medication."
2586,"Practically speaking, I have no choice - I simply can't function in society in my present situation without medication."
2587,"I hate that people always see it as a mandate; like I would be *wrong* if I decided not to take medication, or foolish for not."
2588,Last time I tried a new medication (Prozac) it nearly made me suicidal.
2589,-&gt; By taking medication I may experience side effects that make me want to end my own life.
2590,* Every time I take my medication I am filled with hatred and contempt.
2591,"I don't really know where I want it to go, I don't know if I am open to the idea of medication (I've been on different antidepressants before and I didn't like them at all), or other treatment in general."
2592,"I'd like to hear from people who have experience with these meds, especially in conjunction with each other."
2593,"Soon, she's going to notice that something is wrong with me, I see doctors a lot, I take meds morning and night."
2594,i workout and take meds but i can't stop these negative thoughts from ruining a couple hours a day or stop me from falling asleep.
2595,So I am 30 now and have been on ADHD stimulant medications since I was around 12 years old.
2596,"Anyways, I am just glad to (hopefully) be getting into the right kind of treatment and medications now."
2597,He said he usually does a 2 medication combo for bipolar patients.
2598,"The meds he listed for me to check out were: Depakote ER, Tegretol, Lithium, Zyprexa, Seroquel, Risperdal, Abilify, Geodon, and Saphris."
2599,"He wants me to inform myself on these medications and decide which 3 I find the most attractive to me ""as the consumer"" and we meet again this Thursday to go over them."
2600,"It's been a year since my ""official diagnosis"" and medication."
2601,"I took sleeping medication so I am actually really exhausted, but the problem is that I'm very scared of going to sleep."
2602,"(It also looks like I'm changing meds soon, so I want to have a better understanding of this before I start experimenting with a new regiment again.)"
2603,"I don't think it's the meds (honestly, I don't want it to be because of thr meds.)."
2604,Am I experience withdrawal or just adjusting to the new meds?
2605,"First I'd like to say I'm 95% sure I am bipolar, although I refuse to get officially diagnosed because I am not going to be taking the meds anyway."
2606,My GP gave me medication to try.
2607,"Think twice before coming off your meds, it will take me 3 weeks to get back on them again."
2608,"EDIT: I sometimes think that since being on medication I got worse, now that I am off it things went further downhill because I don't have the support of a synthetic substance."
2609,"I was accused of being drunk and off my meds, then she emailed me some tirade about zombies and assholes, and I didn't bother reading past the first sentence before deleting."
2610,My therapist and psychiatrist said that it was a reaction to the meds.
2611,"I've been off meds for about a year and while I'm not completely on top of my game, I've been functioning well and was not depressed this past winter."
2612,"Of course, I will go on medication if I must but I remember hating the way I felt on antidepressants."
2613,I'm also hoping that my one manic ep was the result of being on too high a dose of meds and not a naturally occurring one.
2614,I am also on a few other meds.
2615,I'm not on any medication currently.
2616,I was put on an SSRI again (I swear to god those are the most useless medications ever) and welbutrin.
2617,"But right now, I'm completely without medication."
2618,My meds recently decreased in level.
2619,"The more meds the better, just as long as I can't hear myself think..

Fuck dude :/"
2620,"And presumably, with medication, I'll do well *enough* to keep this up."
2621,"Until I am no longer covered, have this preexisting condition, and can't afford health insurance and thus my psychiatrist and my meds."
2622,"My doctor wants to treat it with medication, but I am not sure if that is the answer."
2623,"If I don't know how to act socially, will meds help or hurt?"
2624,"I recently started new meds that have me pretty evened out and it had gone away for the most part, but it has come back recently and I'm also cycling down, which just gives it volume and more relevance then it deserves."
2625,"We discussed it, and agreed that some extra medication would likely help the issues I'm having."
2626,"At this point I have a lot of medication in my system, plus a ton of coffee, so that isn't helping."
2627,"The deans office decided that I could come back to school IF I followed their demands:
-I have to return home every other weekend to see my psychiatrist (to have him monitor my new meds) note:skyping with him would not be enough for them
-I have to have sessions with my therapist from home twice a week (this can be done through skype)
-I have to meet with the dean of students with disabilities once a week so she can monitor my classwork
-I have to meet with a woman from the dean's office once a week so she can monitor my mental health
-I have to meet with the president of my building and another member of the dean's office to figure out how my ""integration back into student life"" will go
-I have to go to group therapy once a week for 2 hours
-I am not allowed to touch alcohol at all, even though I am 21 years old
-I have to have a specific plan with my RA to make sure that things are handled properly if I have another manic episode

So basically, even though this was my first manic episode that has actually caused the school a problem, I have to be monitored by several different people at school to make sure I am not a liability."
2628,It's become fairly clear to me that computer programming will be a lifetime challenge due to my bipolar mood shifts (despite medication.)
2629,Ideally I think I'd like to eventually be off my medication.
2630,Are you on medication?
2631,"I quit taking my meds when I started High School, but no matter what I tried I couldn’t keep a Relationship, wasn’t happy with anything or anyone, and hated myself."
2632,"I have recently thought about getting my meds back, I just don’t want to go back to the shy barely talking guy I was."
2633,"I've been in behavioral and cognitive therapy since the 4th grade and I have tried every alternative form of treatment besides medication, but so far they just aren't cutting it anymore, so I'm caving and trying out medication again."
2634,"Basically, I'm together to the point that I don't need constant watch, my meds are in transition but under control yadda yadda, but I get overwhelmed incredibly easily."
2635,Last night I took my meds (including seroquel) around 11pm.... and I was wide awake and full of energy until about 6 am.
2636,"I was so tired from  *almost* getting just 3 hours sleep, that I forgot to bring my morning/lunch/afternoon meds with me to work."
2637,"When I'm either in a manic or a mixed episode (like I am right now), I sleep anywhere from 5 to 0 hours a day, even when taking sleeping pills and antipsychotic medication."
2638,I've been to treatment twice and seen over 4 doctors and tried 10+ medications.
2639,"Nothing helps, the medicine at best manages to numb me from my pain and make me feel like a zombie."
2640,I am truly afraid to go on medication and my parents are quick to brush off any sort of mental problem I tell them about.
2641,"Give me a really good reason to take my meds that doesn't involve doctor's orders, or staying hopeful, or Christ forbid ""positive steps."""
2642,So with meds: I'm heavily sedated and weepy and quick to anger.
2643,Without meds: I'm jumpy and weepy and violent.
2644,"I can't even bring myself to play an active role in my own survival/demise- thinking about it like that, it makes sense why I would go to the Internet for guidance on meds vs. no meds."
2645,I keep thinking that maybe it might work but I been on medication before.
2646,After a year on the latest meds.....
2647,"I'm trying to hold onto my job, I'm trying to keep good on medication, it's hard without a normal schedule."
2648,I don't want to take medication again.
2649,Something I've always been curious about is whether others have noticed a major change in their sleep once on medication.
2650,"I know it's probably not a fair comparison to make, but before being on medication and when I wasn't going through mania I was sleeping 7-8 hours and getting up in the morning wasn't difficult for me."
2651,About a year ago I quit taking the medication cold turkey and ended up getting into a huge fight with my parents.
2652,I was on various forms of medication for at least 10 years of my life.
2653,Id love to not go back to the medication but sometimes i get so sad the only thing I can do is sit and cry.
2654,"TLDR: got of medication for more ""natural"" being and it worked but still feel depressed from time to time"
2655,"I watch my behavior and pay attention to my thoughts closely (I kind of have to, I switch medications a lot) and I've begun to notice these episodes of intense activity."
2656,I held back tears and finally lost it when I met with the nurse who discussed her diagnosis and the medications she was taking.
2657,"Most likely bipolar, probably not schizophrenic, and a list of at least a half a dozen meds she was taking that I had no idea what they were."
2658,I asked the nurse which of the meds she was on was making her behave like that?
2659,"I met with my first psychiatrist and began my medication regimen, completely unguided by those before me but instead in the expert hands of my doctor."
2660,"If you have bipolar, you need clinically-tested, proven medication for your illness."
2661,Along with a proper diet and a good exercise regimen (this last part is where holistic medicine gets it right).
2662,"If you ""think"" you have ""bipolar"" because you have occasional mood swings and sometimes feel depressed or excited, but not ridiculously, overpoweringly excited for 5 days straight followed by horribly depressed for weeks or months, then maybe homeopathic medicine along with diet and exercise is for you."
2663,They want me to get on disability until I get on the right mix of medication and can keep a job.
2664,Is this a temporary adjustment to the new medication?
2665,I really don't want to rely on antipsychotics or benzodiazpenes or self-medication just to sleep.
2666,"A Parkinson's medication, and it's addictive."
2667,"i know i need the medication to function in society at all, but i miss the hypo phases."
2668,I told him that I didn't have the money to reup my meds and actually went off my 300 mg Lamictal.
2669,Off meds and stable.
2670,You can get off meds.
2671,"When I went, I knew something big was coming, and I still felt it with medication and all."
2672,"Been through many docs and meds, hoping this one will help balance me out and I can stop f'ing switching up my meds all the time."
2673,With the meds those obsessive thoughts would nearly evaporate.
2674,I know the right meds can take time to find but when I go to her and tell her whatever I am on isnt really working I always feel like she doesnt believe me.
2675,"Here's a big secret that a lot of people don't know, in modern medicine it's much easier to keep somebody mildly depressed and not take the risk of going manic."
2676,There's no shame in taking medication as long as there are more advantages than disadvantages.
2677,"I trucked on with the medication, until I just could not stand it any longer, and scheduled a follow-up with my primary."
2678,"She told me that the rapid cycling is very rare, and very extreme, and that I may just have had a bad reaction from the medication."
2679,"She recommended a new medication for me, another *newer* SSRI, called Viibryd (vilazodone), primarily for my anxiety."
2680,"This medication, I might add, is so new that I had never heard of it, and that its mechanisms of action aren't well understood."
2681,"About two weeks ago, I got sick with a viral form of meningitis, and was hospitalized for a week, during which time I had difficulty keeping any food, and thus, any medication that was not delivered via IV, down."
2682,"If the meds are exacerbating the D/O, I shouldn't take them."
2683,"I am searching far-and-wide for a psychologist who will accept my insurance, so I can go through some CBT, and perhaps be referred to a psychiatrist, who will help me fond a medication that allows me to better cope with the D/O."
2684,As I consider going back on meds (due to depression during pregnancy) I am concerned that perhaps I should just be on anti-depressants.
2685,I'm bipolar II and I'm applying for an undergrad NSERC grant so I can study medication-induced cognitive blunting.
2686,I'm just wondering which meds have given you the most trouble with cognitive blunting so I have an idea of what meds to focus on.
2687,"I started feeling much better after starting medication (lamotrigine), but I think that I did for a lot of other reasons as well."
2688,"However, I could feel that the medicine makes me sort of... hazy."
2689,At first I thought the medication didn't work sometimes.
2690,And the truth is that I think the medicine makes me forgetful.
2691,I have had this idea now a little while to give it thought; I don't want to just decide I am okay and go off medication suddenly.
2692,Today my mother picked up 40 mg 30 count Latuda at cvs for me being the saint she is because I was so very reluctant to take this medicine from prior experience so 6 pm yesterday I ordered a burger and took my pill then clocked in for my dish washing job 45 minutes later I'm exhausted and had to leave literally only 40 minutes into the shift it was embarrassing whats going on here why does this med make me feel so tired restless and just generally not well keep in mind this is the first time taking it in months
2693,"http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/2g73ik/its_all_falling_apart_again_a_rant/

TL;DR version is that I have an extremely erratic and unpredictable type of bipolar that makes medication difficult, and so far impossible, to get right."
2694,"I feel hopeless and helpless and the pain has made me suicidal for months now, they could have given me an opiate that wouldn't interfere with my meds but apparently no one does that anymore either; because drug seeking."
2695,"And yes, I am on medication."
2696,I always take my medication.
2697,Tomorrow I am going to stop all my medications and eating at all.
2698,"S,o I guess if it will help with that, I'm okay with more meds (I'm also on Effexor and Epival/Valproic Acid), but I'm concerned because I've never been on a 'antipsychotic' before, and that label kind of scares me."
2699,"Thank god taking a few days off, but I wanted to ask you guys what works to calm you down and what meds you're on."
2700,"Sadly though, I am loosing faith in my doctors ( more and more my doctor has been making mistakes ), I have no friends because of my own fault ( self destruction ), I no longer have faith in my family, I'm on great medicine, i'm not depressed and I feel good, but I also know my family doesn't want me around and that really helps."
2701,Or maybe I need a higher dose of meds.
2702,"I've recently had a change in meds,  Cymbalta 60 mg and lamictal, just titrated to 200 mg. We recently hit warmer weather where I live (80-90 degrees) and have been having symptoms of dehydration."
2703,One of my meds (Risperdone) was dropped because I was having awful side effects so now I only have lithium to fall back on.
2704,I've heard all medications for bipolar zombify you.
2705,"You either have to deal with the illness, or the side-effects of medication, which are like a seperate illness themselves."
2706,I think part of it is cognitive blunting from the meds that are starting to get me stable and another part is the fact that I'm not completely stable yet and I'm still doing IOP in the mornings before school.
2707,"She used to be on more meds but now the only medication she is on is fluoxetine, which makes me wonder based on what I read, wouldn't that mean she is susceptible to manic episodes without another medication to counteract the antidepressant?"
2708,She has been seeing a psychiatrist every month for the last few years and recently dabbled with the idea of potentially completely going off medication if her doctor allows it.
2709,Living vicariously through others and limiting self-made crisis with distraction has been a wonderful form of self-medication.
2710,"Knowing that the only way to keep sane was to exercise, eat healthy, and take medication every day is disheartening."
2711,Been on some meds (mirtazapine) to help with sleep and everything else.
2712,"Seems the meds were doing something, they no longer work, and ive gained a lot of weight, but my brain feels like it's ""awakening"" again."
2713,"The meds really made my mind blank, but maybe too much, to a point where I couldn't tell."
2714,"Very weird, but things are returning to ""normal"" as the meds wear off."
2715,Have any of you experienced this and what did your pdoc prescribe along with your other meds to help this??
2716,"):

 Hallucinations, major increase in social anxiety physical symptoms (migraines, vomiting, paranoia), violent (self harm) fantasies, what I call TCMs (tiny catatonic moments) or ""skipping tracks"" like a CD player, short term memory has gone to hell (I cannot tell you what I wore to work 2 days ago nor repeat what you said 20 seconds ago verbatim)

Background: one parent institutionalized violent paranoid schizophrenic; not presently on any Rx meds; began smoking pot 2 years ago

Obviously I'm going to need to go see my doctor and tell them about these new sensations ASAP but right now I'm kind of stuck at home and freaking out and just looking for some alignment to better understand what I'm working with until then."
2717,"https://www.studyingbipolar.com/index.aspx

Not sure what proof to post as the medicine is injected..."
2718,I have been on medications and I hated them.
2719,About two months ago my doctor added zoloft to my daily medicine.
2720,I see my pdoc next week to discuss how the new medicine is working out in my regime.
2721,I just would like to know if perhaps this recent upswing might have something to do with my new medication finally kicking in and the side effects wearing off?
2722,I was wondering if it could be the meds.
2723,"I have been on a couple different meds and seeking therapy (when I could afford to), and it has been helping me understand my disease more."
2724,"Lately I've been struggling with hypomania and mixed moods, so I need to talk to my psych and get on some other meds..."
2725,"I'm on meds, still working on finding the right doses."
2726,The two obvious problems are that I'll have to pay more than double what I've been paying for my meds and I'll have to get a new psychiatrist.
2727,So what happens if I become unstable again and need the have my meds adjusted and have the changes monitored sooner than two months from then?
2728,"I feel like the only choice I'd have would be to hospitalize myself if I needed help, rather than having a pdoc I can call and actually depend on to make sure my meds are always working the way they should..."
2729,"So I quit smoking, and I kept on the meds, and I've never been clearer in my life."
2730,"All of this happened on medication, and yes I fucking took it!"
2731,"Started a new medicine- Risperidone- and wow, what a difference it is to feel in control."
2732,I am not on medication.
2733,I made a lot of bad and horrible decisions that hurt a lot of other people and am wondering if anyone have any ways they've gotten an episode to ease beyond medication or therapy?
2734,Problem is I need to be at bed at a certain time for my meds to kick in and also wake me up at 6am (barely getting up in time).
2735,"It's overspending, overeating, drugs, not taking my meds....and now my parents aren't around to catch me and repair the damage I'm causing before the walls are bare and the place looks like shit."
2736,"I'm not on meds, but the last time I was, syroquil increase dosage every month and vitrasil 200 mgs, which I didn't feel helped because I went manic, lost my job, girlfriend, and family trust."
2737,"Just needed to share...I'm 23, I was diagnosed with Bi polar 1 when I was 18, I've been off meds for years now just couldn't handle it."
2738,I take meds.
2739,TL;DR - I take meds.
2740,"Subsequently I spent the next 3 years working through my breakdown and being diagnosed bipolar, getting onto my meds and rebuilding myself."
2741,I have always been someone who is resistant to taking medication (to the point that even when I have headaches I avoid taking Tylenol etc) so I didn't take my medications as I was supposed to at first.
2742,"This caused me to ""relapse"" but luckily my family didn't take me back to the hospital and just took care of me and got me to take my medications."
2743,"I took my medications for several months and ""stabilized""...What I don't understand (hence the title) is, from everything I've read, most people who get diagnosed with bipolar have to take medications their whole lives."
2744,"However, I stopped taking my medications and have not since November 2010."
2745,I was diagnosed with bipolar a few months ago and I've been able to handle the cost of medication psych visits through the university health center.
2746,"I haven't told my parents, and I've been paying for the meds because I don't want to tell them."
2747,"I'm seeing my psych next week and I plan on bringing this up obviously and probably needing to adjust my meds, but in the mean time, what do I do and how can I cope by myself?"
2748,"She's thanked us about 10 times a week since she got on the meds, she says she feels so much better."
2749,"Night 1 I took a half dose so, 10 mg of Belsomra along with my other night time meds: 400 Seroquel, 300 trazodone, 900 mg lithium, 600 mg carbamazepine."
2750,How do you keep yourselves from staying up too late and drinking tons of caffeine and keep yourselves on meds when you feel fine?
2751,"If i am diagnosed, treated and the medication or whatever effects me in a way that *changes* me, perhaps in a negative way, will this actually make me happier?"
2752,"Unbeknownst to our family, she stopped seeing her therapist in mid-January and stopped taking her medication recently (I don't know how long ago exactly)."
2753,All I can do now is try to calmly sit here and wait for the medicine to kick in.
2754,"Because every time I forget to take my meds, this happens."
2755,I'm bipolar II and I'm off my medication.
2756,I messed up my whole life because I wasn't responsible to ask for help or just take the money to my manager the next day and confess or just take my medication and not be in this situation at all.
2757,tl;dr: I stole money and got caught and now I'm going to be arrested and have ruined my entire life because I was manic and didn't take my medication.
2758,He keeps on his meds and you couldn't really tell he has bp unless he told you or are that close that it seeps through.
2759,My family knows because he has warned me that his meds will invariably will stop working or there is a chance.
2760,I also told him change comes from with in and I cant make him do anything including taking his meds and that he is a grown man.
2761,With the first regiment I received I was hallucinating so I stopped taking pills...my wife insisted a year later she couldn't take it anymore I needed meds again I hate relying on meds to seem normal!
2762,My mood is affecting how I perform at work even though I'm on medication.
2763,"I was having a severe panic attack before I went full manic, which is why I over-medicated (I had just started the meds)."
2764,I have become stable on my meds.
2765,"My meds are working, no more excessive or inappropriate emotional responses, no rumination, no hypomania, no severe depression."
2766,I'll keep taking my meds because the depression is hell and I don't want to go there again.
2767,Now I'm going to be put on 2 meds that cause weight gain...
2768,"This time around, he's consistently skipping his meds, calling all of our friends are random times to talk about random things, and also is spending a lot of money just buying stuff he doesn't need."
2769,I'm waiting what feels like forever for an appointment with a psychiatrist to confirm another doctor's diagnosis of Bipolar II and to probably be put on meds.
2770,"Everything about this is scary: the diagnosis itself, the medications and their side effects, and the thought of losing my ""ups,"" creativity, and individuality."
2771,Can anyone assure me that this is a good thing to do and that meds and/or therapy will improve my life?
2772,"I stopped my meds over six months ago, against Doctors orders."
2773,"I'm happy, relieved, confused...she kept me on all my meds so I don't know what to think."
2774,"Quick rundown of meds: Lexapro, Welbutrin."
2775,"I spent a few days at psychiatric hospital where they handed out medication like candy, and I left the hospital on Lithium, Seroquel, Trileptal and Klonopin."
2776,"His mother is clinically depressed and is taking medication, so he vaguely knew what it was like."
2777,"I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist, who agree that I am textbook type I, and I’m on the road to finding a medication cocktail that works for me."
2778,"My psychiatrist thought it was depression, but after several visits and several medications (mainly antidepressants causing me to be hypomanic), he concluded that I am type II."
2779,"I graduated from college without medication for the most part and well, my insurance is no longer there."
2780,"I don't live in a state that offers help  for mental disorders (trust me, I've spent countless hours looking for help), so I was forced to be off of meds since."
2781,Anyone else have anything that helps them on a day to day basis without meds?
2782,I know I need either a higher dose (she started me on 25mg on November 20th) or a new medication.
2783,"I stopped going to see the doctor and stopped taking the medication and by the time I gathered the willpower to go back, I discovered that my insurance was gone."
2784,"Recently, I have been put on the correct medication."
2785,"It took a few months of different medications that had messed me up, majorly."
2786,"I'm still struggling with taking my medicine, I don't remember/don't care enough to take it so I have to be reminded by my girlfriend and mother to take it."
2787,"Anarchist opinions in psychiatric medicine tend to be very negative, since they consider it as a method pf subjugating and mass control."
2788,"I know that it's one of three drugs I could die from the withdrawl, though if my dad doesn't have his heart medicine he dies (yes, I know these aren't biologically the same)."
2789,"well I shouldn't read the rest of my medicine info, or eat hamburgers for my heart."
2790,I can't take sleep meds because they all cause me to have really back restless leg syndrome.
2791,"I am Bipolar ii and my meds are currently:

Daily...
lithium (900mg)
valproate (600mg)
thyroxine (one tablet unsure of mg)
lamotrigine (1/2 tablet unsure of mg)

I think the valproate has pushed my weight up rather than the others, in 6 months i have gone from what was once a steady 77kgs to now 83kgs which for me is too heavy as i am only 5""9 and not a big build at all."
2792,"So when I get home i take my meds, eat, then shower."
2793,"The only medication I take now is lithium, because it's natural."
2794,If we're lucky we'd look forward to meds time because that's often our source of relief.
2795,"I've been on tens of dozens of different medications these past eight years for bipolar, and Modafinil has strangely been the one to save me."
2796,I can't get up because a side effect of one of my meds (seroquel) is heavy sleep for 12 hours upon taking- making it very hard for me to wake up.
2797,"The meds side effects are a sensitive topic for me, as there are a lot and they have changed who I am over the course of taking them."
2798,"A person, who with maybe the right combination of therapy and meds might not be dead or in jail and who might still be remembered as a person (i.e."
2799,She always says that the best thing that ever happened for them was that her husband was hospitalized and they found the right medication for him to be on so their life could settle down and they could be happy together.
2800,"I got out of the bath tub and searched for the pain meds I was just prescribed, but I guess luckily I couldn't find them in my shit hole of a room :( I haven't managed to keep it organized ever since my last hypomanic episode."
2801,I have gained weight but not due to the medicine.
2802,I am stopping the medicine so I can have a manic burst to lose weight and just feel upbeat for a bit.
2803,"going for different anxiety meds tomorrow, might even try a different mood stabilizer."
2804,"I am on meds now which would allow me to function, but that's not what I want for myself ultimately."
2805,"I think that it could be beneficial if both people are open, communicating clearly, taking their meds, taking care of their health, etc...."
2806,I'm sick of the meds making me vague and ditsy and having people get frustrated with me.
2807,"I'm on meds and everything."""
2808,"For clarification, I'm curious to see if anyone after being diagnosed, has chosen no medication treatment, and use alternative options."
2809,"I know it is dangerous to stop taking meds, but I just want to know how bad it can be, so it will force me to take them.It's more to scare me than anything."
2810,"I guess I just needed to get some shit out, I'm really fucking elated to just be done with my depression, but I'm confused because I've been taking my meds exactly as prescribed (300mg lithium twice a day, 300mg Seroquel, 100 mg Lamictal) and I just took a Xanax but it's not really working, do any of you have any advice for me?"
2811,"I'm on medications, but it doesn't stop the feelings."
2812,"My meds aren't working so well anymore, and I know I need to just accept the disease and go on."
2813,"I sure have a lot to learn in keeping with my mental health care - mood journals, medication, therapy, education, but I think it's time I had a change of scenery."
2814,"I've been on and off ADHD medication since 2008, currently on 50mg vyvanse and a small dose of adderall as needed."
2815,Could it be my add medication exacerbating symptoms?
2816,I hate going through the process of finding a medicine without crappy side effects!
2817,Conversely he still gave me a prescription for my meds.
2818,I'm feeling like my meds need adjusting as my moods are really unstable at the moment.
2819,I've stopped taking my meds for a few months now and I feel really weird.
2820,"Coming off of that enough to start on new meds was...whooooo boy, that was terrible."
2821,I don't know if it's from my meds or bipolar or life but I'm just angry all of the time.
2822,I was like this prediagnosis and have noticed it for the past few weeks (less than a week on the new meds).
2823,I would contact my psychiatrist but the wait to get an appointment is often longer than a month and I don't want to be off of my medication for that long.
2824,But the main question is how did people manage the interim period between changing medications?
2825,I'm guessing my medication will be changed by my pdoc this Monday considering any higher dosage of Seroquel makes me completely numb emotionally.
2826,Just..feel somewhat terrified of the prospect of a) relapsing further or b) being on no/little medication for a few weeks as I'm forced to experiment and acclimatize to new medications.
2827,I'm really hesitant about taking medication.
2828,"Even if I were to be diagnosed with some type of bipolar disorder, would it be worth it to get on some sort of medication?"
2829,"Also, I'm generally against taking medication if I can help it."
2830,What other sort of non medication type things can I do to keep it from getting worse?
2831,"Would I be prone to being easily pushed into the DEPRESSION ZONE, while this medication is being taken?"
2832,"Since the medication, I've been maintaining a steady low, with a few extreme lows."
2833,"I'm on medication, w/o hospitalization, but its not making a huge difference."
2834,I am currently pretty stable (thanks meds and therapy!)
2835,"And now, I'm on or have been on layoff status since last month and I don't know when I'll be able to pay for my meds."
2836,Anyone here know if they're ONLY when you're on the meds - you go right back to how smart you were if you stop them?
2837,"which is know is fair in reaction to adjusted meds, stress and worry and then emotional backlash from him."
2838,"I have a stable, full-time job that doesn't pay much but I have incredible health insurance that's definitely helped with paying for all my bipolar needs (psychotherapy, pdoc, meds)."
2839,They took me off the meds the other day because I was on the ol' lamictal and got a rash.
2840,"And tonight someone who I don't know that well, needed someone on facebook to chat to, and then I found out they were heavily abusing prescription medication while talking to me."
2841,"I'm afraid I'm going back to where I was, and that I won't be able to find another medication that gives me that stability that I need, and if it does, I'm scared the side effects will outweigh the benefits."
2842,This year I'm on meds to prevent a manic episode but find that the side effects give me extreme fatique and may cost me my job.
2843,"We got her into a talk therapist for a couple months and today the psychiatrist confirmed, bipolar type I, medication prescribed, starting low and going slow."
2844,"She never explained what it was, and immediately prescribed medication."
2845,He's refusing meds but having irrational episodes and thinks everyone else is the problem.
2846,"I called our old therapist and he says he needs to get on the meds right away and he is worried that he's headed for a hospitalization, which would be such a setback for everything he's overcome."
2847,"tldr; worried bf (type 2) will have serious meltdown affecting both personal life and career 


edit: I talked to him about taking his meds but refuses."
2848,I usually just work through it but I missed up this time and missed some meds and have a lot of pressure with personal stuff at the moment and I was really worried about costing the company loads of money if I ballsed up.
2849,I started meds.
2850,Starting meds was one of the best and most important decisions in my life.
2851,My meds aren't working as perhaps they should.
2852,"I'm really, honestly not hypomanic, just firing on all cylinders for the first time since the meds."
2853,A medication thing?
2854,"I know self medication is frowned upon, but I just find it interesting."
2855,I feel like I am back to where I was before I even started to take my medication.
2856,"Since posting, less than two months ago, asking for reasons not to commit suicide, my medicine has kicked in, my friends have held me up, and I've made new friends."
2857,"Friends of his have said that he is supposed to be on medication for this right now, but is currently refusing to take them."
2858,Goddammit these meds are making me numb and foggy but I still know that deep sadness and guilt and suicidal thinking is still there.
2859,I want to stop taking these meds.
2860,Im trying to find a different medication.
2861,What has medication has been successful for you with the less amount of side effects?
2862,"Long story short, I was diagnosed with BPDII (w/mixed episodes and rapid cycling) about 4 mos ago and meds still aren't right (lots of bad reactions or just didn't do anything for me)."
2863,What I'd really like to hear from you guys out there is how long did it take you to get your meds right?
2864,I've recently been diagnosed and came to a place where I feel that my meds are working correctly.
2865,I have questions though about some of the 'side effects' I think I'm having as a result of BP and/or the meds.
2866,"I have tried taking long walks, my doc prescribed a blood pressure medication even though I don't have high blood pressure."
2867,Nothing is helping but the medication itself has helped my bipolar.
2868,I know wanting to drink myself as a form of self medication isn't the right thing to do.
2869,"I know I need medication, but that takes time, and just as importantly money."
2870,"I need money to get the meds, and the time to wait for them."
2871,He isn't interested in taking meds or going to someone who can help him out with the hardships of bipolar.
2872,Can any of you share your experiences or observations with taking bipolar medication?
2873,"3) Were you put on medication/therapy, and are you still continuing it?"
2874,She keeps talking to my doctor when I want him to start weening me off my medicine and tells him not to.
2875,I also started taking some meds ( Lamotrigina ).
2876,I am taking my meds religiously yet I still feel like everything is fucking hopeless.
2877,I've been in recovery now for a year - on meds for depression/anxiety/insomnia/bipolar.
2878,We have adjusted my meds and adjusted my therapy to no avail.
2879,"See, I take my medication faithfully."
2880,"During all of the good days I have, I know that it's not due to me getting better, but it's the medication just doing its job."
2881,"Now, to those of you who do get convinced that you are getting better and go off your medication, how do you convince yourself of that, especially after the first or second time?"
2882,Don't repeat episodes of mania/depression indicate to you that it's just the medication working?
2883,"She's definitely on the long road to recovery now, and receiving medication and regular therapy."
2884,When the meds stabilize me and I'm no longer suicidal).
2885,Over the last few months my meds have been regulated but something still didn't seem right.
2886,"Additionally, my meds (seroquel, lithium, depacoat) apparently make my period irregular, so far that I recently went 5 months between cycles."
2887,"Just two years ago after going on disability for over 6 months from a major manic episode where I spent $20,000 on my credit cards and everyone feared I'd never be able to go back to work, I finally started recovering on a new medication."
2888,This is something I would never have been able to do without my current medication (Lamictal and Latuda) and I feel such a sense of accomplishment.
2889,"With the right medication it is possible to live a successful, happy, fulfilling life."
2890,I get suicidal most times I'm depressed and I've been very tempted to take all my medication at times.
2891,"More often these days, I think I'm fine, and that the medication is just working; I'm happy."
2892,I've been juggling medicines for about 3 years now and I'm fucking exhausted.
2893,I feel uncomfortable taking so many medications and worry about how they're going to interact.
2894,Is anyone else on this group of medication?
2895,I'm having severe suicidal thoughts once or twice a week which is a big improvement from everyday since I started taking my meds.
2896,"I feel like this medication is helping a great deal, its just not helping enough."
2897,"My doctor has me on a mix of medications, but I continually feel worse and worse."
2898,And then the thought enters my mind: maybe you don't really need your medication.
2899,"It's kind of scary, especially since the thought that I should stop taking meds keeps entering my head."
2900,"Ok, so in summary: had seriously incompetent provider that over prescribed meds, and then blamed me for the subsequent reaction going so far as to suggest I did this for ""the high""."
2901,"Just what this parent (coming off some incompetent asshole's fuck-up with my meds) wants to hear, let me tell you."
2902,I have chronic pain and take lots of meds.
2903,"My docs say it's normal considering my mental health, chronic pain, and all the meds I take fore these ailments."
2904,"I'm unsure if it's due to stress/trauma/possible PTSD, or from the medication I have taken in the past that has affected me in this way."
2905,My complicated health makes almost all medication impossible.
2906,I've tried loads of different meds but I have a kidney thing which means I can't take some of them.
2907,Or is it just stress and if I took my meds again I'd just feel flat too and even less able to deal with stuff?
2908,"If I see my psych he'll just say to take them, I'm thinking more why shouldn't I manage my own meds and take something I can take when I need to and not when I don't, why doesn't that exist?, if it's because they're worried about addictive behaviour how is that different from taking something long-term anyway, surely that could be a good thing when meds are SO hard to stick to taking?"
2909,"I'm not an idiot, I'm aware of how prescribing meds works and yes, I'm aware that I can change docs if I want to, which I already have, that's just common sense surely?"
2910,"When I've got no symptoms and everything's normal, which I can tell whether I'm on meds or not, why should I take anything at all that day?"
2911,"yes, I get it that that would be because the meds had built up to a therapeutic level but I'm still 'on' something that day that I don't want to be, it's still affecting how I am and how I act and think, I'm saying I don't want that, I'm not ill every day so I don't want to med every day."
2912,"[article][mania][depressed][medication] etc
Happy mania week for me!"
2913,"I thought my meds were working, but they weren't (fuck all of you who tried to tell me that because you were right, anyway)."
2914,My meds are shit.
2915,I was wondering if anyone has used this medication and if they have noticed any significant side effects and if it seems to work?
2916,"(Just to add this in even though it may be obvious to some of you, there are two big reasons I don't want to get pregnant for some time: 1, my boyfriend and I mostly live paycheck to paycheck at the moment and 2, I don't want to deal with getting off my meds because of it) So anyway,  today I finally got the call; my insurance is going to cover the ENTIRE thing."
2917,I went off my meds a couple months after I met him and slowly spiraled into almost total madness.
2918,"There are bouts when I can be off track, but as long as I take my meds, I can even out and make headway."
2919,One thing holding me back is access to medication and the effects trips could have on me.
2920,Worst of all I have been taking my meds properly and I still experienced a week of hypomania.
2921,All the other meds I've taken make everything fuzzy.
2922,"I'm finally on medication, and I feel a lot better."
2923,He called me and refilled my meds for a month and gave me a few names of doctors I may like.
2924,I want to get on meds and get my life together but I'm afraid finding the right regimen will fuck me up and make everything worse.
2925,"I have't been officially diagnosed with BP but I am on lamictal and abilify which has been working pretty well for me, better than any other medication I've been on."
2926,Edit: Aaaaaand the mirror door over the medicine cabinet in the bathroom is now broken.
2927,"She is getting medication, but went against everything her therapist and doctor have said."
2928,"Anyway, I am still not on medication."
2929,So I haven't taken meds yet.
2930,"I'm scared of the side effects, and half the time I think (illogically) the medicine is going t make me a vegetable."
2931,"The other half, I convince myself I don't really have bipolar, so taking the medicine will kill me."
2932,But I don't know how to feel about medicine.
2933,I'm scared of becoming dull once I'm on meds.
2934,"And I'm scared the doctors will be mad at me for not taking the meds they prescribed when I see them tomorrow

Well, I guess this post wasn;t too long"
2935,They told me I might have bipolar type 2 and put me on meds for that.
2936,They told me I might have ADHD and gave me meds for that.
2937,"I've been off my meds for weeks at a time when I just forgot or didn't care and most of the time it doesn't seem to affect me, but sometimes it leads to depression so I try not to do that anymore."
2938,"It started out with me being weirdly introspective and somewhat depressed, getting my ADHD meds, promptly abusing them to stay up for three days straight, sought out a dealer and bought meth for the first time, but for the most part hiding in my room with nothing to do and lots of energy."
2939,I don't want to be on my meds anymore but at the same time I don't want to fuck with them because there's a chance I could drop into a depression because of it.
2940,I'm still under good treatment with therapy and medication.
2941,"[LifProTips](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/15zhpd/lpt_having_trouble_affording_your_medication_or/)

2942,"I'm bipolar, and due to money/insurance circustances, am currently on no medication (other than benzos to combat social anxiety; I'm taking relatively small doses, and have been prescribed for over 12 years)."
2943,On Monday he will meet with me to discuss medications.
2944,I have no idea what meds she might be on and whether or not she will find a doctor once she is here.
2945,I am going to see a psychiatrist shortly to talk medication with them.
2946,I woke up this morning and tried to take my morning meds (lamictal) with a Monster energy drink.
2947,"I have a strong gag reflex so sometimes my meds get stuck in my throat and it's nasty and tastes awful, but this morning when they got stuck they fizzed up like alkaseltzer!"
2948,I think it's because I'm on sleeping meds and can't watch my sleep cycle.
2949,Luckily my meds are free with my provider but I can't afford $130.
2950,"I need a way to find a doctor with a cheaper copay (they were like $25 or $35 where I used to live) and keep getting my bipolar (and possibly anxiety) meds too, but I have no idea what I'm doing."
2951,"I also haven't been on a stable medication combo yet, for what it's worth."
2952,I've been trying different meds and now i've found one that agrees with me but the thing is I don't know who I am anymore.
2953,"I have to take meds, that's not up for debate."
2954,But now as a 22 year old I'm back on meds and doing a psychiatric treatment.
2955,Would love to ask some questions about how the medication I'm on makes people feel.
2956,"She mentioned withdrawals, but then goes ""I also take other medication for depression... Well, I actually have bipolar disorder, the down one not the up one, those are also hard if i miss a dose""

""You mean Bipolar 2?"""
2957,Then we get in this long conversation about it and went through all the medication we've tried and it turns out we both also take Lamictal and how great it's been.
2958,She now says bipolar is a wrong diagnoses and stopped taking her medication..
2959,She hates medication.
2960,I finally have insurance to go back to the doctor to get meds.
2961,It wasn't until a police escort to his psychiatrist appointment was required that he was admitted to psychiatric care for a week and a half and extra meds were added to his routine.
2962,"I am learning to ask for help, and I am getting my meds adjusted."
2963,Does anyone get their med refills from their primary care doc (general medicine) instead of a psychiatrist?
2964,"It's ramping up, so maybe the meds need to, too."
2965,She's having trouble finding a local psychiatrist who can assist in tapering down the medication.
2966,"I have already been diagnosed with two chronic autoimmune diseases and worry when I get off their insurance, no insurance company will take me on due to my always needing medication until I die."
2967,"When discussing the medication itself and the effects it's had on me, my therapist mentioned a theory she read about and had been discussing with some colleagues about why anticonvulsants like Lamictal and  Depakote can be so incredibly effective for so many people with bipolar disorder, which pretty much boiled down to ""it kinda does the same things to certain parts of your brain as a seizure, just slower and longer""."
2968,Here's little background about myself and medication.
2969,"I have been, all my life, someone whose been extremely resistant to the aiding effects of medication, or has needed very high doses of medication for them to work."
2970,"I've tried mood stabilizers and antidepressant medications since I was 16 (now 23) and unfortunately, none have assisted in easing my illness."
2971,"I see my psychiatrist on Friday and am going to bring this up and, if I have to, beg for an antiabortion medication."
2972,"I've tried a lot of meds, finally settled on lamictal and lithium."
2973,"Plus, I have two teenagers to support, and if I divorce him, I will lose all my health benefits, which will mean no more therapy or meds."
2974,I ** cannot** go back to being the person I was prior to meds.
2975,I need medication ASAP because my anxiety and bipolar are ruining my life.
2976,I have been looking for another psychiatrist lately wondering if I should look into medication again.
2977,I have been off of my medication for some months and honestly ever since I was diagnosed I find it hard to tell when I'm just being my wild self or if I'm manic.
2978,What medications do you take for anxiety?
2979,"I was diagnosed with OCD, depression, and panic disorder many years ago, and I've been in treatment for those for some time now (meds and psychotherapy)."
2980,"I stopped going to my doctor after she tried to make me take mood stabilizers for bipolar but I refuse due to the side effects, then she just increased my dose of medicine that turned me into a zombie so I just quit going and raking pills all together."
2981,I want to see if I can get on something else but I fear that I am doomed to be on medications that will affect my personality in profound and negative ways.
2982,I only feel natural around 10PM when I think some of my meds wear off.
2983,It bothers me because I figured that my medication was supposed to stop psychosis but instead it has destroyed any of the pleasant feelings and replaced them with terrible and disgusting feelings and images in my head.
2984,Has anyone been there and did medication help?
2985,Starting to open up to the possibility of medication.
2986,"I mean I can start drinking coffee again :)

I'm just getting sick of now being sick from my meds not my illness (well that too)."
2987,"However, over the past few weeks I've felt more reluctant to take my medication."
2988,"Now the next question, those of you who think it may be the hypo vs the meds, what are some tips to stay level headed and prevent full blown mania."
2989,"I don't really have any kind of support, except from the meds and my family."
2990,"You also have to know that before being diagnosed, I've always had been against medication amd thought the idea of a ""happy pill"" was pretty absurd."
2991,"However, once I started my medication, a saw a huge improvement and now I take it religiously every day."
2992,I am scared of falling back in my suicidal thoughts if I stop taking my meds though.
2993,Should I stop my meds or should I go see my doctor so he could seitch me on other ones?
2994,"If you're going to run out and buy a bunch of supplements, it's particularly important to note that while Omega-3's will very probably not interact with any medications, calcium supplements inhibit the absorption of several medications/vitamins."
2995,She had subjected her body to unnecessary medicines and her behavior unnecessarily altered.
2996,Now I'm sitting here wondering if I really need to be taking 5 different meds and if I've kept myself from living life in the fullest.
2997,Everyday i love waking up to have a countdown till i can take my meds to go back to sleep.
2998,"I only take meds to help me go to sleep, or i bipolar, i went to a hospital and i still don't know what im diagnosed with, i should talk to someone about that, if only i go remember things past 10 minutes."
2999,"I'm considering the fact that the switch of meds may be a coincidence and something else may be causing this, but it seems like the reason."
3000,Genetic; caused quite a few tonic-clonic seizure for like 2 years; they kept switching my meds until they discovered Depakote worked pretty well.
3001,"At the psych ward they increased my meds a WHOLE lot and now I take super high doses of Lamictal, Depakote, Zoloft, Vyvanse, and Trazadone."
3002,"I was on medication for almost 10 years, off and on."
3003,"I'm off medications again (insurance, finances) and I realized that every time I stop medication, it seems like my symptoms are worse than they were before I started taking medication."
3004,Have I gotten used to medication?
3005,"How can I tell him that no matter how hard I try and how many meds I'm taking, I will have really bad days/weeks."
3006,"I see why so many people just quit meds, because going through this sucks."
3007,My [meds](http://m.imgur.com/teJXkNE) are feeling a bit frisky.
3008,"What I'm really getting at is that no matter what progress I may make as a person, whatever coping strategies and medication keeps me relatively level headed, as soon as someone notices my scar I know it will bring me back to square one."
3009,She asked me if this was a side effect of the medicine I am on now.
3010,Can this be the medicine?
3011,He has prescribed me medication for bipolar disorder.
3012,I take other meds to for other health problems.
3013,I thought these meds were helping this time.
3014,"This is what makes it hard for me to take my meds, the godlike manic phase where I'm the shit and everyone loves me."
3015,"As much as I like being stable when I am on my meds, it is fucking boring."
3016,"I’ve tried several medications, several different doses."
3017,"I also really hate being bipolar, no matter how much I learn about it, how many techniques I learn on controlling my swings, or how many meds I try or don’t try."
3018,Our robot is pushing meds through every second with a loud clamping noise.
3019,"Whether I take meds or not, it’s never going to stop."
3020,I have been diagnosed with BPD-II in my home country was on medication briefly but then moved away to another country and the doctors never requested a medical record and I never bothered to tell them.
3021,"I am a supposedly recovered anorexic, but, after getting to a livable weight and leaving hospital, my medication for psychosis (which I'll explain later) caused me to start binge-eating."
3022,I had been saving up medication.
3023,"I already know a lot about Bipolar Disorder and the medications used to treat it, but I feel like he gets enough of the clinical stuff from his therapist and psychiatrist."
3024,"My medication doesn't let me become manic, but it doesn't seem to stop be from becoming sluggish and depressed."
3025,"I am happy to see you, but because of the severity of your problems, I'd recommend medication."
3026,"Get medication for Depression, severe Anxiety, and ADD."
3027,"I knew the doctor might be upset, might just take the medication away, might do some other thing."
3028,"*

*I still don't know what I want to do with my life, many of the problems I had pre-medication are much worse, I'm still addicted to amphetamine."
3029,"*

*No new prescriptions for old medications - at least for now."
3030,"*

---

I haven't started the meds."
3031,"I'll add that I have started the meds, though I'm really struggling to take them as prescribed."
3032,"I had my meds just right for a few years, then I started college (this was a major feat, and I absolutely could not have done it 5 years ago) and everything kind of fizzled out."
3033,Now I'm back on the medication rollercoaster and nothing feels right anymore.
3034,"Hi everyone who reads this

So I just started on Lithium and I realized my meds with alcohol= aggressive (VERY) behavior (verbally)."
3035,I was diagnosed when I was ten so I got the hard part of meds and going to therapy out of the way while I still lived with my parents.
3036,My sleep tea is so strong that I've forgotten to take my meds at night which usually means no sleep but I got good enough sleep to be fine the next day.
3037,I have zero medication fog too.
3038,I've seen dozens of therapists and taken dozens of medications and nothing has helped.
3039,Finally leveling out I think and got all my meds right.
3040,"I mean if a psychiatrist can't help me, if there are no meds that can help me, and I'm too trapped in my own personal hell to help myself, than who can?"
3041,"This lead to better medication and more stability, but we have had a setback recently."
3042,"Meditation, medication, therapy."
3043,The meds they gave me don't work.
3044,Before meds I worked two jobs - mostly full time and it was great.
3045,After meds I totally just crapped over the other job (I started the business built it from nothing and then let it die).
3046,"I'm going to be brutally honest with the doc and let her know I almost want to go med free and get back to unmedicated and let her start fresh with me or see if I'm better able to handle things and maybe look at less meds, etc."
3047,I have been on meds.
3048,"So here is the current state of the union of crazyland:  

I've been in and out of therapy/treatment/on and off meds for a while now."
3049,"Creetcher stayed hydrated, stayed on the Gabapentin (the only meds I am currently prescribed), and stayed on schedule."
3050,Has anyone else been on this medication and had strange side effects?
3051,He told me that he was taking about 9 medicines in the past and all of them (beside lamotrigine) had really bad side effects and his psychiatrist wanted to treat him with lithium.
3052,"All of the medication and the therapy, which have admittedly helped in some ways, have drained me in so many other ways."
3053,"When I left work the second day they were really understanding (I just said it was a medication problem), and today when I texted my boss."
3054,"It has been many years since I have experienced mania thanks to medication, until last week that is."
3055,Because it has been so long since I was experiencing the severe swings I didn't have a real baseline to go by to compare my post-medication mood swings to.
3056,"So yeah, I don't remember how things were before meds, so as far as I know the episode I just had could possibly have been one of the most severe manic episodes I have ever had."
3057,"**

I've tried tons of meds but I know my options aren't exhausted."
3058,"On top of needing medication for treating bipolar, I also have ADHD, social anxiety, and a history of addiction."
3059,I tried my best this semester to try and get to know them once my medication was having an effect but alas I've been getting nothing but silence unless I'm standing right in front of them.
3060,but now i'm trying meds and shit... and i can't focus anymore.
3061,"Haven't been posting much recently (not sure anyone notices these things, but this is where I'm at if anyone has been wondering) due to being fairly depressed after a long mixed episode... Been tweaking my meds with my pdoc."
3062,After my last epic crash (and why I started on meds) I've FINALLY started to feel really like normal me again.
3063,my roommates would wake me up to give me my medicine and feed me and such.
3064,"when i woke up from my two day sleeping binge i felt much more sane, thank god, and i got it together long enough to go to my doctor and get my medicines adjusted."
3065,"I need to get refills on my medications, as well as a medication adjustment (Meds are not working well at all)."
3066,I really liked the medication otherwise.
3067,"I'm curious to know how your medication has affected your appearance, and what you were on."
3068,"Diagnosis Dec 2010, medication starts."
3069,[Feb 2012](http://i.imgur.com/Q6t65.jpg): Been off meds for 3-4 months.
3070,"After having a very emotionally heavy day, she become paranoid that my family stole her Vyvanse script and they were all sharing the medicine."
3071,I'm not medicated and would like advice other than to take medicine.
3072,I'm paying attention to my moods and cycles and want to figure out whats up without meds before I go down that route.
3073,I know it can only get better but I blame myself for the manic episodes (all came about due to wrong medications or me wanting to quit and a combination of alcohol and drugs).
3074,"About this time last year I was ramping up into what was to become a pretty severe manic episode, and I couldn't be more grateful to be stable on meds."
3075,"Last week I decided to smoke (I don't often, but I have while on my meds before and after the dosage change)."
3076,I'm not on meds right now.
3077,I am VERY NERVOUS about if I need to get back on medications.
3078,I'm wondering if anyone else has experience with this medication and has it been helpful?
3079,Majorly suicidal and not on meds yet.
3080,"She is very compliant with her medication regimen, and able to use cognitive exercises to bring herself down from less severe manic episodes."
3081,"She's on medication, and it seems to work sometimes, but it's just enough."
3082,I take my medication.
3083,"People complain of weight gain on certain meds and I'm wondering if this is because the meds alter metabolism (or something else physiological), or if it's because people's eating and/or excising habits change?"
3084,"In fact with my current regimen of medication and therapy, I can basically get through the day.... until bedtime."
3085,What can I do to get some sleep when I've run out of my sleep meds?
3086,I didn't want to give their child teething medicine without their permission.
3087,"About 3 weeks ago my doctor upped me medication, and I really do believe it's causing this whole thing with my moods being suddenly out of control."
3088,So to start; I haven't taken my meds for about 3 months because my insurance was cancelled on January 1st and I am still waiting to hear if my information has cleared through the state.
3089,I'm only doing this because it's easily accessible and much much cheaper than the meds that I'm on.
3090,"I'm just really worried that my body is going to get so used to it, like the majority of the meds I've been on, that the beneficial effects are only going to be for only the first hour or two after consuming and then going into an episode."
3091,2) Is there anything asides from medication that helps tone down your depressive episodes and mixed states?
3092,"(I'm not sure if I'm being close-minded or idiotic, but I have been really reluctant to take medication to treat my bipolarity."
3093,I finally found a psychiatrist who put together an amazing combination of medication.
3094,"So, I'm surprising myself by keeping to my meds schedule."
3095,My med doc is out of town due to a family emergency and I honestly don't trust other docs to prescribe me mental medication.
3096,Has anyone ever had memory loss from a medication?
3097,"I have since been medication free for the past 6 months, but still have problems remembering things from the year I was on Abilify."
3098,"Part of my problem is disordered eating, but the meds add a physical component to the cravings that makes them a lot harder to fight."
3099,"I have rapid cycling bipolar disorder, am currently seeking treatment thru a councillor (I will be speaking with them about this during our next appointment) and am not taking any new medication, nor have I had a change in my meds for quite sometime."
3100,"Ongoing issues I've been having include memory issues - I've always been forgetful, but I don't know if there is something more wrong with me, or if it's the medication."
3101,"Technically she's not the doctor, she's the APN but she's the one who prescribes me my meds."
3102,"At the age of 22, and 34 medication later- I decided to quit."
3103,"I quit smoking, I quit being abusive to myself, I quite medication, I quit everything."
3104,"Withing the 10 years I spent being BPII, the only delusional, hyper-manic, schizo, hallucinogenic episodes I've EVER had were when I was on medication."
3105,"I've spend too many years (26) holding this on myself when I am more ""normal"" off than on medication (I.E."
3106,"I graduated HS with a .08 GPA and now hold a 3.98 GPA in college off meds)

Opinions?"
3107,"It seems like his depressive episodes keep getting worse, even though he's been doing the medication trial-and-error dance for a while."
3108,While being off my meds it has always been easier to write.
3109,Should I come off my meds for a bit to see if I can do this?
3110,"My SO is very wrapped up in his own well being and care (rightfully so) but it takes up most of his time, between meds, moods, sleeping, maintaining schedules, and his career there isn't much time left for me, and often I feel like my needs go completely unmet, unrecognized, and not even on the radar, and will continue to be that way forever more."
3111,"I haven't been medicated yet, I'm trying to decide between Lithium and Risperdol as well as a few other medications."
3112,Not sure where to go from here apart from full pharmaceutical medication to be honest.
3113,Now that I'm on the medication I feel as close to normal as I could expect.
3114,I'm taking my meds as prescribed.
3115,2) Is there a way I can tell if I'm back to normal without stopping my meds?
3116,3) My dreams have been goal-based since starting medication.
3117,"Well, after an incredibly difficult year of finally seeking treatment, mood episodes, ups and downs, new medications and all out just feeling mental, I am so proud to have been accepted into my chosen Honours Program."
3118,Have any of you faced this problem with the medicine you're taking?
3119,Do you think it would be wise to quit my medicine before i develop something permanent?
3120,"I would love to get some support from people who have this illness, and some advice on what I should do about lowering my medication."
3121,I've always taken my meds with food because stomach but I don't have much of an appetite these days.
3122,I just want the medication.
3123,"I just want the fucking medication but I can't afford the visits to their fucking terrible ""services."""
3124,TL;DR: How are your meds?
3125,Have your meds helped you with this?
3126,She's being treated for it with meds and weekly therapy but she thinks she's unable to work.
3127,My insurance policy *would* completely cover her therapy and meds ($1000+/month) except she totally blows off filing claims.
3128,"Before starting the medication, I probably slept for an hour a day."
3129,"I am so upset over the fact that my life has been so mediocre since leaving that school 8 years ago, and now it's gotten to the point where I can't even stop pacing in public (at least before starting the medication)."
3130,"However, I took my last dose last night and am also without my alprozolam emergency break, haven't heard back from Dr. about what to do and am scared of what will happen with out the sedative meds."
3131,I work in the mental health filed (planning on starting grad school soon) and feel like a hypocrite for telling my clients to take their meds/having to be strong for them.
3132,I started to panic because suddenly it seemed like my hair was falling out and I'm afraid it is from my meds since I'm on several that can cause hair loss even though I've been on them for a long time and haven't really noticed any.
3133,"So I just saw my dr last week and she actually gave me an appt for a longer time than usual, 6 weeks instead of 4 so I won't be able to discuss anything with her about meds even though I probably wouldn't want to because I know she would flip out if I want to change anything!!"
3134,"Yesterday, I felt the most wonderful sense of clarity and I believe that perhaps the meds I've been on have been stifling me and dulling my brain way too much."
3135,I told him that I started to cut back because of my hair and how I now realize that I've been weighed down a lot by so much of the medication and that I think it might be a good thing that I had to do this and maybe a sign that things should change!
3136,"His opinion is that it is not at all a good thing and that it sounds like I should get right back on my meds all the way and that I'm actually hypomanic and he's concerned about a manic episode if I let it go, etc..."
3137,The only things that have changed are that I'm appreciating the beauty in everything more because it all looks so much brighter to me and I think it may be because of loosening the hold the meds have over my mind.
3138,Or at least a medication that has less dramatic side effects.
3139,I do see a psychiatric nurse practitioner for medication though.
3140,"Some brief hypomanic periods I can identify which, in my opinion, were likely medication induced."
3141,"Extended periods which I now recognize as mixed states which also, in my opinion, were likely medication induced."
3142,I feel like my medicine isn't really working.
3143,"I mean I am not totally on my real medicine dose I need, I'm on seroquel 100 mg (all in one pill) seroquel xr 300 mg, and 100 mg of lamictal."
3144,"I need help, how to get rid of them because medicine is off the table until I see my pdoc until a while."
3145,I got back on all my meds had a migraine got it cleared up.
3146,Thew up in triage and was quickly given medicine.... Now have to ha e a bunch of blood drawn.
3147,Never forgetting my meds again......
3148,"I have had a really hard time spending month's at a time of not leaving my apartment, being hospitalized for ten days, but now am on medication and feeling a bit better."
3149,However they sectioned me within 2 days - they can force meds and food;  restrain you.
3150,The medication side of it here is awful but hopefully I see my ward doctor today.
3151,Did the meds miraculously kick in or is there some other factor at play?
3152,"I am on meds, though

edit2: Mania is diagnosed when three of more of the following symptoms are present; an elevated, agitated, or irritable mood, a decreased need for sleep, an increased need to talk, racing thoughts or lots of ideas, abnormally high self-esteem, difficulty focusing attention, an increased in goal-directed activity or difficulty sitting still, and reckless involvement in pleasurable activities (like sexual indiscretions, or excessive spending)."
3153,Has anyone else experienced something like this with an antidepressant or other medicine besides anti-anxiety?
3154,"It has been a difficult time for me and seems that no matter the medication, treatment, or what have you, I am continuing to spiral out of control."
3155,"I go to therapy, I journal, I take medication."
3156,I've been out of meds for almost a month due to a health insurance snafu.
3157,"One) does anyone else out there experience this and two) until I get my meds, does anyone have any tips on dealing with this."
3158,What happened to you to realize you were dangerous without taking medication?
3159,"I am not aware how most feel about their condition, I've only been reading a few days here, but I've seen some post that say the regulation of medication is the best thing

I have to completely agree, I've been on medication for 4 months and it is amazing when its working."
3160,"I was always diagnosed with adhd as child, but my mother refused to put me on medication which I haven't decided is a good or bad thing, my judgement on medication is skewed because my only experience with medications have been overly positive."
3161,I've noticed that when on medication I am more than a full functioning socially responsible human being.
3162,"I don't have doubt, fear, or low self esteem or anything, which is upsetting in a sense that, while the medication is being effective thus making me ""normal"" I don't have any issues that most suffer from like depression, etc.."
3163,"I did lose another job recently, which leads us back to the medication."
3164,"So I love keeping up with the meds, but they make me tired, any tips?"
3165,Now I'm on better meds and I am taking my sleep schedule very seriously--I get unstable quickly when my sleep pattern varies too much.
3166,Where this is becoming super frustrating is finding the proper medication to deal with the manifestation of my bpd thinking— extreme mood swings.
3167,"And, it did— extreme rapid cycling, with little impulse control: it was the first time in my life id seriously considered hurting my self and others, not to mention I've ran up thousands upon a credit card in the month period of taking this medication."
3168,"So, the doctor ordered me to stop the medication and suggested abilify, but i've been left so scared from the experience that I've found a different doctor."
3169,"I am super hesitant to treat this situation with medication because many of the medications suggested seem to have a decent reputation of causing serious physical and cognitive side effects, which I also experienced, or, they will just further exuberate the mood disregulation."
3170,Are there any super safe medication that is used specifically for mood instability?
3171,"My problem is that I've been on most bipolar meds, and basically the only options I have left (should I go off Lamictal) are Depakote or Lithium."
3172,Some medicine advice/experience please?
3173,"My shrink wanted me on depakote for bipolar 2 instead of an ssri or lamictal and I suspected he was wrong, my brother in laws psychiatrist said it's the wrong medication."
3174,Might it go away soon or should I try another of those medications.
3175,So we all know our moods and medications can have a big impact on eating habits.
3176,How do I get rid of it until my medicine starts working?!?

3182,He refuses medication and treatment.
3183,"Recently I went up my dosage for medication and I can ""feel"" it kick in after I take it."
3184,I can't remember the name of the medication off hand (very long name) but its also used to treat seizures.
3185,"I went through a lot in the few months after we started dating, up to and including believing that I had lost my insurance (long story) and going off medication."

3187,"I went off of the meds just before I moved into my new apartment, which he joined me in living at."
3188,"I know that it is his lack of understanding that caused him to leave, and tbh if he hadn't I probably wouldn't be going back on my meds which is a very good thing right now."

3193,I did not lose a single pound off my meds.
3194,The docs there changed my meds up and hopefully it'll be better this time around.

3196,"I looked to see how she's progressed since she got on medication for the treatment of bipolar and it looks like she's got severely worse by evidence of videos of her on an apparent (obvious) manic episode with pressured speech and psychotic thoughts in which case she cannot even form a single proper sentence, delusional grandiosity and homicidal ideation."
3197,"Long time lurker on reddit, have decided to make an account because I have a very close friend who has been diagnosed as bipolar II (but not currently on meds)."
3198,I researched for hours on both my medications and the disorder itself.
3199,"Im still taking meds, monitoring the situation, but well just fuck."
3200,Right now (I'm on five different medications at the moment) the anti-psychotic that my psych has me on is not working.
3201,"When I brought it up with my doctor she gently reminded me that ""not all meds work at first"" and refused to change them around."
3202,Now I'm stuck with meds that I don't even take and I feel as if I'm back at square one.
3203,"How am I supposed to get her to take this seriously, and does anybody have any ideas of what meds I could take that might help?"
3204,"I thought the meds were supposed to keep me stable, but I'm hiding in the bathroom again."
3205,I can't changes meds again.
3206,I'm really running out of reasons as to why I shouldn't just take all of my leftover pain medication and put an end to it all.
3207,"I don't know if he is type 1 or 2, I know he's done a total of two weeks of meds and counseling before giving up on both (back in 1995/1996, following the suicide of his identical twin and marital issues/separation) and has instead self-medicated with pot and drinking since then."
3208,"They go on and on about the girl and how crazy she is, and then the conversation turns to Bipolar in general and the kinds of meds they hear of people needing, some stories about people who are off meds... Lola wasn't saying much, just smiling and nodding and barely glanced over at me."

3214,i think most of the positive feeling about my diagnosis and medication is most likely the prozac.
3215,I guess I'm going through a bout of insomnia even though I've been sticking to the meds pretty well.
3216,I didn't like to believe in this shit because it didn't make sense to me and I think people use it as an excuse and I don't want to take medicine and I like to think I can heal myself but objectively speaking today I was really fucking pissed and irritable and then I just started laughing a lot for no fucking reason and now I'm horny as shit.

3224,I've been angry - actually throwing things - forgetful and I have been reluctant to taking my medication (but I do because I figure I need them).....
3225,I have to go in there tomorrow and explain to them all of this and probably end up with another medication switch.
3226,"I feel hypomanic or mixed because there's days or nights when I break down and am so distraught about everything with my pills and life....

3227,I think it's time for me to start some therapy and medication again.
3228,I'm tired of new medication and adjusting them.
3229,I've not been prescribed any other meds.

3241,"I take my meds, and Im trying to change, but I let myself down first chance I get."
3242,"I've done well in a creative field and I'm terrified that if I start medication that I'll lose that edge and I won't think the way I do now, good stuff and bad stuff."

3246,"I have anti-anxiety meds and although they work, they make me VERY sleepy (I've tried a bunch of them) and I can only take them if I will be able to take a long nap."

also of course listed for both meds withdrawal symptom is what it was treating."
3248,"I'm trying to do everything I can to get stable; exercise, eating right, taking my meds (100mg Seroquel, 200mg Lamotrigine and Valium when needed)."

3265,"""Oh, meds aren't working?"
3266,"Let's try more meds."""
3267,"**TL;DR: Diagnosed in 2009, almost jumped off bridge, saved, got diagnosed, got medicated, got over medicated, moved to CA, got off of medication, met the love of my life, had to see a doctor anyway, 75mg versus 200mg/300mg, feeling awesome!"
3268,"Now I feel like I'm on meds for something that doesn't need to be treated, and the anti-depressant effects of the new meds is negligible."

I've been with my boyfriend (I am also male) since 2004, knowing he was bi-polar, but managing it without medication."
3288,"After that event, he promised to stay on the new meds his doctor prescribed him (depakote), gave me full authority to ensure that he take it, that we would go to the hospital no questions asked if I ever said so, and also that he'd have no more pot."
3289,"Fastforward to a few days ago - he has been acting erratic, and I start to question him on if he is taking his medication, and he swears he is."
3290,"Finally on tuesday of this week when I got up and he was still awake, he finally told me he had not been taking his medication for the last two weeks (I think it may have been longer), so we made immediate plans to go to the hospital."
3291,"I also want to make sure that he regularly sees his doctor like he is supposed to, instead of just filling his medication."
3292,But I embarassingly am unsure- is this normal or ok for a bipolar patient to be on two meds?
3293,"Also, how can I ever make sure he is even going to take his medication after he promised and then lied about it?"
3294,"**tl;dr**- gay boyfriend smoked way too much pot, stopped taking his medication, and was hospitalized."
3295,After a long trial and error of medication I was put on Wellbutrin and Lexapro.

3298,Should I try getting on different medications?
3299,"Anyway, she called me today and told me to please consider meds again if i want my life to work with her, getting kids and manage a real job for a long time."
3300,"It struck me and i can't deny it anymore,, i need my medication to function as a normal human being.,,, I don't know what i wanted with all this but it really hurts me admitting being sick(again) and at the same time its awesome to have someone taking your illness in a serious manner."

3302,"As far as the medication I'm taking, I've done a little research but nothing conclusive."
3303,"The meds seem to be helping, and my memory loss is going away, so the meds side effects are getting better."

3311,"John is type I bipolar untreated, severely unstable, has tried a badly prescribed bout of medication once when a university doctor threw him on 300mg of Welbutrin right off the bat with no titration plan going up or coming off of it."
3312,"Needless to say it was a pretty horrific experience for him, and as a result he has declared that all medication for bipolar is evil, anyone who takes it is deluding themselves, yada yada yada."
3313,"When I met John in college, I agreed with his notion of swearing off medication and together we were two crazy bags of crazy for a while."
3314,"I worked with a therapist for a while, but with my job and the money I'm paid (which isn't much) and the time it takes up (which is a lot) I'm forced to stick with the meds my psychiatrist gives me and go for monthly appointments with him."
3315,Things with the medication have been going so-so.
3316,"I've begged him many times to get help, but he has refused and even berated and mocked me, telling me that I've ""sold out"" because I take medication to treat my illness, that I was ""more real"" when I was suicidally depressed because at least that way I ""knew I was alive."""
3317,"MUCH NEEDED tl;dr: Bi-polar friend is crazy, verbally and sexually harrassing people in the workplace, mocks anyone who takes meds for illness."

3321,I struggle with alcohol as a means of self medication.
3322,"That, or my meds are working."
3323,"Either way, she declares that she doesnt need ""fat girl"" meds like that, and will only take her Adderall and Xanax (of which she needs to take an entire bar to go to sleep) that she convinced some GP to prescribe to her."
3324,"She takes quetiapine/seroquel for her medication, she had been without from friday-monday and was prescribed slow release tablets by mistake so past couple of days have been tricky for her in that she has been perpetually tired."
3325,"he bounced around on medications but couldn't seem to find a happy medium , the last one left him so lethargic he would sleep for 15 hrs."
3326,I had to stay at the monastary for 2 additional days and luckily a doctor was there who found some meds and looked after me.
3327,So now I'm on meds that make me feel dead inside and I can't motivate myself to do anything.
3328,I'm chalking this up to being back on my meds for only 10 days and if I stay on them for a month or two the grogginess and fog and negativity will abate.
3329,That they admitted me into ICU for observation and medication and what not.
3330,I took a four day break from my Vyvanse then added Vistaril to my sleep meds to help with getting sleep.

3342,"About a year ago I started meds during what was the most traumatizing, darkest winter of my life."
3343,This feeling is what keeps me on meds.
3344,"Given this fact they've sent my counselor numerous emails saying things such as ""Lithium is the wrong medication for my son"" and ""There's no way that I'm actually suffering with this disorder""."
3345,"Reading about your manic episodes reminds me that I won't be depressed forever :) I'm unmedicated, and planning to stay that way...I know most of you take meds and couldn't live without them, but I can't give up my mania."
3346,"Now, since I am not officially diagnosed I have not tried any medications meant to deal with the illness and I don't know too much about them."
3347,So...is Lithium (or other medicine) anything like this?
3348,Annie proceeded to tell all of us (close friends and family) that she was seeing them and they put her on a bunch of medications and nothing is working.
3349,I find out today she never went to see the new DR. She stopped taking all medications as well.
3350,I do take my medicine everyday.
3351,So I am basically asking is the medicine doing what it should do?
3352,I'd been doing great not forgetting to take my meds by the method of collecting them all the night before and taking them the first thing I do the next day.
3353,"I decided the lack of food in my stomach upon taking the meds was a bad idea, so I started taking my pill box to the breakfast table with me."

3363,"She was opposed to taking her meds, but they told her she couldn't leave unless she did."
3364,"Since she isn't a fan of meds and doctors, I told her I was concerned about her and she should go talk to the people at her church, I figured they could tell the difference between mental illness and religious fervor."
3365,"She said she would swear on a stack of bibles to take her medicine (she's really into God, so that's something), and she knows she needs them to stay out of the hospital."
3366,Her daughter said she does quite well on her meds.
3367,"She said she had an episode when she went off her meds about a year ago, but before that she had been taking them for six years without a problem."
3368,She said she thinks my roommate went off her meds because she didn't reapply for govt assistance and just blew it off.
3369,She said it usually takes about 3 weeks for the meds to kick in (it's been 2).

3373,Would love to ask some questions about how the medication I'm on makes people feel.
3374,At my worst I was on five psychiatric medications that I absolutely needed to survive.
3375,"I have a wonderful psychiatrist that I see when needed, and I've been off all psychiatric medications for **almost a year."
3376,"But what scares me is the message that was pounded into my head during years of 'treatment': *if you are diagnosed with bipolar disorder you will always need medication, it's a chemical thing that never goes away and if you think it's in remission a relapse may be right around the corner."
3377,"The meds they gave me, latuda and buspar gave me paraskinasia, crippling anxiety, and developed weird physical tics i have yet to get rid of."

3382,I'm wondering how being on medication for the first time is going to feel.
3383,How was your first experience taking medication?

3386,"I have been feeling pretty good recently and am on depamide which keeps me stable and non-hypomanic (though a week ago I missed a couple of doses - long story, I was stuck in another country without my meds)."
3387,I don't really want to change meds because quetiapine is working the best out of everything I've tried so far.
3388,I've been taking my meds that have been working decently for me for the last month on time every day.
3389,I refused medicine because I felt find and felt that I could use it to my advantage.
3390,I'm fucking done with her medication I'm not fucking taking a pill that does fucking nothing but make me gain 20 pounds and counting.
3391,"So I was going to the school psychiatrist for medication for a while, and I stopped being able to see her in May when I was no longer a student."
3392,Without medication I can't function.
3393,I can afford the generics of the medication that works for me - I just can't afford to see a psychiatrist.
3394,I'm wondering whether it's worth trying to get some meds to go with the lamictal.
3395,I'll never be sure if it was the medication or the bipolar that led to..
3396,"I really want to blame the meds for that one, but I'll never really be sure."
3397,"Crying for no reason, not being able to get out of bed, not eating, grades dropped, barely making it to class or showering, suicidal ideation...I was working with a psychiatrist and therapist with medication and counseling."
3398,"My fiance suggested that I have a white board and section it off for meds, journaling, and exercise."
3399,I take ADHD meds daily along with lamictal.
3400,Really haven't had to use my anxiety attack medicine in a while except for this past week.
3401,Just wondering if all these meds are necessary?
3402,"the suicide attempts, the mixed episodes, the medication changes, the sleep deprivation."
3403,"After a misunderstanding about my facial expression, I told my trainer that I was experiencing anxiety due to a medical condition and that I needed time to adjust my medication."
3404,Later that weekend I had to increase my medication because I was having what I recognize now as delusions about being watched by people I knew.
3405,"I know what occurred was discrimination, and very similar to the 2011/2012 case about a bipolar man who requested time off to adjust to his new meds."
3406,"So, on my meds now, and I have found that I'm very much so an attention whore, with needing external attention from *anyone*, and loads of reassurance."
3407,My pdoc went to a new job out of state and the person they want me to see to replace her is a super bitch and already wants to change my meds.
3408,My meds have been working awesome for 5 years and she just wants to disregard that and implement HER  meds.
3409,My sex drive seems to have gone way down since I've stabilized (which took a little while because I never wanted to take my meds regularly).
3410,"Okay so backstory: 
Parents and doctor took me off all meds an it's been like 2.5 weeks and ugh fuck all of this."
3411,"They're all like ""they don't work enough"" yeah okay I get that cool come change my medicine so I'm normal."
3412,Honestly do people even know I need medicine.
3413,Can taking ADD/ADHD meds put you into a hypomanic mood or heighten it?
3414,"Recap: can you get hypo/manic off ADHD/ADD meds with something or alone 

Edit: forgot to write down that I just made this literally after I put the computer down."
3415,Currently doing better than ever without meds.
3416,"I haven't been prescribed any medication yet, my psych wants to talk with me in about a week to decide."
3417,"It makes me upset, and fearful to go on medications."
3418,I struggled to make it to therapy and I struggled to take my meds every night.
3419,"I have been off meds for about 6 months, and have been diag."
3420,Doctors giving me medication is a test.
3421,"They give me meds that I could take and kill myself with, but they have serious trust that we want to get better and that we want to live."
3422,"I know that the progress I've made is because I have worked my ass off, but wow...I feel like I am blindly following them to lead a more enriching life, if the medication and therapy even work."
3423,"I wanted to stop having to take the Prozac, just like I have avoided taking any medication for my bipolar."
3424,I am nearly out of medication and am out of my clonazepam which really would have been great to have.
3425,"At the moment all I have is a 30min appointment with my psychiatrist to look forward to, and I can't even pick up my meds."
3426,"I had myself voluntarily committed got out AMA, was prescribed lithium, smoked marijuana and fudged the doses of my meds which led me to ANOTHER psychotic episode and an involuntary hospitalization where they assigned me the meds i'm currently on."
3427,Because of the meds I feel all sorts of depressed but I can't bring myself to cry.
3428,I'm just wondering if it's normal to be on so many meds simultaneously and what can I do to fix my life.
3429,"I'm srictly opposed to taking any sort of medication (I'm only 17), but if it's the only way I'll do whatever it takes."
3430,"To those of you suffering from this disorder,  how do you deal with it without medication?"
3431,How do you deal with it without medication?
3432,"New meds have my brain set to ""happy"" yet I know its not real, I have been a recluse for two weeks now and everyday my fear of life shoves me deeper into my bed, my prison yet paradise."
3433,Just thought I would ask if any of you had any negative experiences with this or starting other stimulant medications.
3434,I've only recently started therapy and medication.
3435,Before I was diagnosed and started therapy and meds I had many episodes and didn't realize it.
3436,"I'm sure with intensive therapy I could learn not to, and when I was on prozac I never cried.. but combine the fact I'm 34 weeks pregnant and have been off of meds for that entire period of time (and out of therapy), I think I'm allowed to cry."
3437,Our goal is to raise awareness about mental illness and explore the research and medicine available to treat mood disorders.
3438,"To be honest, I don't think I was manic (I know I'm not now) and I've been taking my medication regularly."
3439,I stopped taking my meds because of this (bad idea I know) but they made me so nauseous that I always felt like I was on of puking.
3440,"My therapist once mentioned the idea of receiving my meds another way, such as injections."
3441,"i should feel happy because this was the last powerfull medication to get off of, the previous being clozaril, the most powerful antipsychotic."
3442,Hey I am being told the medicine I do is working.
3443,"Deep down I know, and have always known that this medicine would not do much for me without intensive therapy."
3444,"I know she's been going through a lot these past few weeks, starting on medication and whatnot, but she seems like she doesn't want anything to do with me anymore."
3445,i was diagnosed bipolar I and started medication about a year ago.
3446,I've just gotten out of an appointment (that took months to get) with a new psychopharm who's putting me on the right cocktail of meds.
3447,"*I know that your not suppose to take unprescription meds, but I did because self-hospitalization and psychologist at the time didn't help and I saw no other options."
3448,But two nights to bed early and waking up on time for my meds without an alarm has been great.
3449,My doctor is in the process of switching me off some meds onto Depakote (750mg).
3450,"I'm in between NOS and II (my high periods don't last quite as long as someone with BP II but they still cause issues like BP II...something like that), so she's starting me out on the lighter side of medications with lamotrigine, which I just started last Tuesday night."
3451,"To anyone who has experience with this medication, is this something that passes with time as my body acclimates?"
3452,"I notified my pdoc on Mon and was told to stop all of my meds immediately (Celexa, Cymbalta, Trileptal, Vistaril, and Propranolol, and Imitrex-PRN)."
3453,"I'm worried about stopping my meds so suddenly, especially Cymbalta since I've heard how horrible withdrawl can be

Bipolar Moms and Dads, what tips/advice/experiences do you have for a first time parent?"
3454,"The alarm for his meds just went off, and he says he's just too sick to take them."
3455,"So I haven't been out much since I've been trying new meds, I also stopped drinking at the start of the year."
3456,I've been put on medication to stop it but does anyone else experience their legs becoming extremely active and you feel restless at the same time?
3457,"I was originally diagnosed with depression, so I'm currently not taking medication specifically for cyclothymia."
3458,"I choose to not take my meds, I don't do exercise, I don't eat the right foods (I eat what I'm allergic to), I don't go to as many therapy sessions as I need to, etc."
3459,"I have a friend who I have gotten very close to in the past year or so, I have always suspected her of being bipolar,  but she is diagnosed adhd and abuses her meds."
3460,Have you ever dealt with someone who stops taking their meds and won't see reason?
3461,"First of all, as Bipolars', we shouldn't be drinking at all b/c the alcohol cancels out the therapeutic properties of our medications."
3462,Just saying this b/c I drank about 16 Bud Lights while grilling in the hot hot sun on Saturday after taking my medication and it wasn't pretty.
3463,"However, I did text to apologize to both of them that I BBQ'd too long and had one too many beers in the sun (left out the medication part)...."
3464,I have been extremely unstable on this medicine.
3465,At that moment I had to break it down that I was not calling as a joke and I needed to get off the medicine.
3466,My desire to live for myself and my family has always been so strong and this new medicine tried to rob me of that.
3467,"I also feel like no doctor will acknowledge my panic attacks and try to help me deal with those with immediate relief medication, they would rather keep putting me on extreme chemicals."
3468,The side effects have been the worst I've experienced on any medication.
3469,"I recognize that the medication is working and I think this is supposed to be the goal, but I can't help but feel like I'm no longer myself."
3470,(I think it is a combination of meds and eating disorder.)
3471,Does anybody ever feel like quiting meds just to feel manic because it feels great until you are super delusional then it just gets weird?
3472,Did you try lifestyle fixes before getting on meds?
3473,I have been diagnosed Bipolar 1 and been on meds for about a month.
3474,"I have already sunk a lot io funds and time into school for this, but I am concerned that even with meds I might not be ablest perform at the eected level."
3475,Any medicine changes?
3476,"During these episodes are when I have gone to doctors and tried various medications and talked about various disorders (on my prompting, doctors were very hesitant to discuss any possible diagnosis)."
3477,"Never adhered to any of them, mostly because of substance abuse not playing with their medication or because I began to 'feel better', more disconnected once again."
3478,"(The last 20 months medication free)

I know the risks of combining psychoactive substances and mental illness are nothing new, but is it common at all to be misdiagnosed as bipolar II?"
3479,Or has anybody gone on to live with good mental health without the need for meds?
3480,That I'm ready to go to regular therapy and be put on whatever meds the docotrs say.
3481,"I feel like my medicine (Lamictal, Saphris, Kapvay, Effexor) has made me completely stupid and it is really bothering me."
3482,Have any of you taken concentration meds with bipolar?
3483,"She didn't give me a diagnosis or really explain what this medication *was* other than as ""something else to try to keep helping with the depression without going too far."""
3484,Should I be concerned that she's prescribing me medications without explaining that thoroughly?
3485,"Even with the medication I take faithfully, my reality is still bent."
3486,kind of serious question...i know too many meds blunts your creativity.
3487,She's been on her meds the whole time.
3488,"BTW she had forgotten to bring her meds with her, but her parents brought them."
3489,She didn't want to take her meds in front of them though.
3490,I've been on 5 or 6 medications for my bipolar disorder for a couple of years now.
3491,I've been on and off various different meds trying to find a good balance.
3492,"So instead of increasing them further, he's added another medication, so now I'm on 7."
3493,And I'm 31 years old but because of all my medication I need cialis/viagra if I want to have sex.
3494,"I'm finally feeling fed up of feeling just okay, and I want to see if I can get on less or no medication with a doctors approval, don't worry ;) I'm not just going to stop taking them suddenly as I know what that can do."
3495,Just my current doctor is very adamant that the medication is working and that I need to be on it.
3496,"Has anyone been in a similar situation, and can anyone shed any light on what would be a good first sensible step towards freedom from medication?"
3497,"I'm wondering whether anyone here takes medications ""as needed"" for their bipolar disorder."
3498,I'm back on meds and it's the 1st time since fall of 2012 since I've been on them.
3499,"I thought I had the coping skills to deal without the meds, but I didn't."
3500,"I've been back on meds for week and I'm building a new support network, as well as working on letting the few true friends I have back into my life."
3501,"TL;DNR  Finally back on meds, and rebuilding a support network"
3502,My doctor kept upping my meds while my counselor kept telling me I wasn't bipolar.
3503,"Well, that annual tradition of tapering off medications has begun."
3504,"School starts soon, meds."
3505,"Class is too hard, meds."
3506,"Unemployed, meds."
3507,My medication has recently been changed.
3508,So I need a day off or maybe half a day of work  once a month to see my psychiatrist to follow up on meds or any issues related to me being bipolar.
3509,"As of now I pretty much got my meds working out great for me so far, other than some anxiety/mini panic attacks here and there but I'm the best place in my life as of now than ever before."
3510,So basically my medication M.D.
3511,"As a meds solution, we tripled my Pristiq (to 150mg, a very unusual dosage)."
3512,"So long story short:

* We **dumped Abilify**- always a troublesome medication for me."
3513,I spent the next 2 years in and out of the hospital and on as many as 22 medicationss per day.
3514,"I have been pretty lucky to be fairly functional and stable with meds, I'm just not sure how to bring that up?"
3515,I am in treatment and taking an awesome cocktail of meds- it just doesn't feel fair.
3516,"Is the stress getting to me, or maybe the meds have stopped working?"
3517,"During a full assessment for ADHD (which, I guess, I do definitely have) the doctor who was seeing me asked if I could provide a full medication record."
3518,"When I gave her my full medication history, she immediately started suspecting bipolar disorder (probably type 2?)"
3519,"Things like, ""medication x gave me intense anxiety and heart palpitations"" or ""medication y caused me to become more depressedthan usual""."
3520,She explained that it's not unusual for a person to try one of these meds and have that sort of experience...but it is unusual for someone to try 7 different medications and have them ALL fail or abruptly stop working.
3521,"I was also prescribed lamotrigine for treatment-resistant depression...and it's the only medication that HAS consistently ""worked""."
3522,"Anyway, she's recommending that I go to a specialist for bipolar disorder and that I keep away from stimulant medications."
3523,There is no way in hell medicine will work for me.
3524,Ideations of this magnitude haven't happened since I got on medication in October.
3525,There's so much advice out there suggesting that a combination of therapy and medication helps the most.
3526,The medication part is obvious but what are you supposed to get out of therapy?
3527,"My main concern is that now that he is finally on consistent medication (Haloperidol) that seems to really be helping him, would he benefit by smoking cannabis for his ADHD--the only thing currently bothering him anymore--or would it interact badly with the Haloperidol?"
3528,"I've avoided all psych meds, with the exception of a dose of Seroxat/Paroxetine proscribed in my late 20s (I'm in my 40s now) that sent me into full mania and almost did away with me, because I have felt that, for me, the risks/disadvantages associated with the 'cures' were not worth it, all things considered."
3529,"So I'm still in the process of finding the right med cocktail, and meds are a crucial component of get to a higher quality of life."
3530,"I'm never not going to stop taking my meds, at least those that work."
3531,"I've sifted through a few duds and a few with bad reactions (lexapro, lamictal) but I know I need some further medication."
3532,"At this point I'm going to ask my pdoc to take a month off of new meds, just let everything settle."
3533,"Basically I've become fatigued from side effects (both from good and bad medication) where I need a break, to catch up."
3534,Afterwards I'm going to keep trying new meds as I'm extremely determined.
3535,My question is has anyone reached a point of diminishing returns on their meds?
3536,"Edit - For clarification I have no intent on going off my meds, I will continue on those me and my pdoc have selected."
3537,"So what headache medicine can I start taking, then?"
3538,"I'm already on a number of meds including lithium, seroquel and 2 antidepressants so I don't know what the doc can do for me."
3539,I decided to go off all meds completely.
3540,"I also don't know what kind of meds to take yet (not asking for recommendations, I just feel a bit lost and will do research.)"
3541,For the most part I don't want to take any medications.
3542,medication.
3543,"Like my mom said, if you've got diabetes you take medication for diabetes."
3544,If you've got high blood pressure you take medication for high blood pressure.
3545,"First of all, I was diagnosed with Bipolar I a few years ago and am on meds."
3546,Also I wonder if it is due to a medication (probably anticonvulsants).
3547,"My meds are working pretty good, I think."
3548,No meds.
3549,it's the best medicine.
3550,I'm not doing this because the medicine is making me feel better.
3551,I hate the way the medicine makes my body feel.
3552,"In addition to some medication for physical issues, I'm also supposed to be on an antidepressant (started taking it almost 20 years ago) and a mood stabilizer (started a few years ago)."
3553,"Earlier this year, I became pretty sick with a series of head colds, a sinus infection, and very bad seasonal allergies, during which I stopped taking my medications as often, until I wasn't taking them at all."
3554,"In the past month or two, those issues have cleared up, but I've had a really hard time getting back on my meds."
3555,"I know I may have endure a couple of weeks of nausea once I get back on my meds, and I'm having such a hard time doing it."
3556,"&amp;nbsp;

The sickness I get when I take my meds interferes with my ability to:

&amp;nbsp;

* Do my job (which is part time)

* Search for a second job (because my first job barely allows me to make ends meet)

* Enjoy social time with my family and friends

* Do things that make me feel productive, like cleaning up around my house

&amp;nbsp;

There are other things in my life that are a huge problem even with me not being on my meds right now, and may be preventing me from taking my meds properly, and are made worse by the sickness I experience when trying to get back on my meds:

&amp;nbsp;

* I have terrible sleep habits

* I don't eat right

* I don't exercise as much as I should, when I exercise at all

&amp;nbsp;

All these things have combined to make my life a vicious cycle of bad habits and unhealthy living."
3557,I've been having my medications prescribed by my primary care physician.
3558,I don't know if it's just meds or if it's me trying to fuck myself over so I'll lose my job.
3559,Well adjusted to my meds lately.
3560,"I hate being watched all the time, and I don't want to take meds that poison my body."
3561,"Does that mean I don't need the meds anymore, potentially?"
3562,I have been wondering if this is a product of socialized medicine (subsidised medicine is cheap) or if it is sponsored doctors or worst of all if my doctor is overmedicating me.
3563,When I'm on medication I hardly want to have sex.
3564,"Now I'm back on the meds, and it's sad to realize that the same thing that makes me sane also makes me be a shitty boyfriend in regards to sex performance...

She is very understanding, but we all have our needs."
3565,I've just been diagnosed with mixed bipolar and have started medication.
3566,"I realized it might be the meds, so I googled it."
3567,"When I originally went to my current psychiatrist, it was to explore the possibility of my having ADD as my school psychiatrist does not prescribe any ADD medication."
3568,I was wondering if anyone has any thoughts or experience with ADD medication and bipolar disorder.
3569,"Obviously, I am not looking for medical advice, just hoping to get some personal stories to go along with my research (I like to research any medication and therapies before I even bring them up to my psychiatrist or counselor."
3570,I had a breakdown and 3 Prozac coupled with many anti anxiety medication was not doing the trick.
3571,After working with medication doses I have noticed a huge change in my life.
3572,I originally gave up on meds but I'm giving them another try because I feel like I have no other hope.
3573,"It was brought on by the mixture of bipolar meds (Do not take Tegretol if you are not healthy, just my experience) and painrelief meds I started just over a month before."
3574,My sister wouldn't tell me at the time but later on she expressed her concern for my medication.
3575,I didn't want to be off my meds to carry the pregnancy and there is no way I am stable enough to take care of a child.
3576,"I was diagnosed with bipolar in high school, got lots of therapy and was on medications for many many years."
3577,I finally weaned off the meds in grad school when I was trying to get pregnant with my son.
3578,I do not want to go back on meds.
3579,This seriously scares me because I may be put on these kinds of meds.
3580,She's been diagnosed with bipolar for a few years now and I think she's having trouble with her medication.
3581,I can't tell if I'm just a shitty person or my meds aren't working properly.
3582,(I am stable and on medication)
3583,:( The generic is three times as much as my other meds.
3584,"I've been comfort eating and med eating and put on 20lbs since I was diagnosed, mostly due to the medication."
3585,"I knew that it would be high of course, and the last thing I need need while sifting through hordes of medication is knowing that I have another area I'm neglecting."
3586,Now I feel like shit because I can't even stay healthy with the medications and the depression.
3587,"I'll admit, after having been on the medication for about a week that I have noticed what I would call an improvement in my ability to handle triggers without slipping into a deep depression, only instead having a mild panic attack that I was able to recover from within a day and a half or so."
3588,"I know I'm supposed to cope and medicine will help me with it, but it changes up down up down up down."
3589,"My doc is pushing for it because we've had problems finding meds that work for me ever since being pregnant, and I've been hesitant because I question its validity as a tool since it's so new to the market."
3590,I'm so tired of the confusion of medications and negative affects that some bring.
3591,"I had an allergic reaction to abilify, and I haven't had any medicine for weeks."
3592,"I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 for a while now, but I had stopped taking meds for a while since everything seemed okay."
3593,I self harmed and took two doses of my anxiety medicine.
3594,My medicines seem to work for a few months then I am back to where I was before slowly.
3595,I do not usually take this medication but I have some in reserve for emergencies like this.
3596,My primary care took me off the meds and am having a hard time trying to take the step forward to scheduling an appointment with a Pdoc.
3597,"Hey guys, I was diagnosed about 5 months ago and after some trial and error I found some meds that seem to work: 

1.5 mg risperidone
200 mg lamictal
30 mg celexa 
15 mg adderall xr

I'm also taking 50 mg synthroid for a slightly under active thyroid...

My problem is that even with eating healthy and working out, and even with adderall and synthroid, I'm still gaining weight..."
3598,I see many people with bipolar constantly complain about the depressive aspect of it and how their medication doesn't treat it.
3599,"Guys, medication can only help you on the biological level of the brain, but I think most of you are depressed for other reasons."
3600,"If no medication helps you, it means the problem isn't biological but psychological : you're depressed because of an element in your life that bothers you."
3601,I have manic episodes but my medication helps me a ton with that.
3602,Stopped meds and had a couple really rough months.
3603,For the first time since 2009 I feel like if I don't get on meds soon.
3604,I know I need to go back on meds.
3605,If you could recommend an alternative medication I will bring it up with my doctor.
3606,My psychiatrist is insisting I take Seroquel but I am very skeptical about taking any more meds and I refuse to take Lithium because of my fear of weight gain (recovered anorexic).
3607,Came home and took my medication and I'm starting to come up.
3608,Just got back on medication during the last manic episode.
3609,Just wanted to share that medication does help.
3610,"I've found that meds get me part way there, and especially when I'm faced with sort of an extreme situation, I feel very vulnerable to a depressive episode."
3611,"I have more appointments scheduled for meds and one for a CT scan because when I feel manic, it feels like there are bees in my brain and I can't think correctly or remember much during that time."
3612,I've been seeing a therapist for a number of weeks who diagnosed me with bipolar II rapid cycling but could not prescribe me with medication herself.
3613,I actually did fairly well off my medication.
3614,The lack of medication began to affect my personal and work life so I started seeing a new psychiatrist.
3615,"This is my first time on medication, so I don't know if I should feel lucky I didn't have worse side effects or keep adjusting meds until I am happy all-around."
3616,"Furthermore, if I could please spend time pondering and testing the effectiveness of different medications, preferably without displaying any more emotional swings, that would greatly please ~~the overlords~~ my parents."
3617,I am 17 and my mom refuses to allow me to take medication and she can't even have a normal conversation about it.
3618,"I have been feeling a bit off lately, with coming back from a vacation where I went into a mixed state and had to up my meds and then mess with them coming back from another time zone, I digress!"
3619,I need renewed scripts for pain medication.
3620,Maybe my medication is making me feel this way?
3621,When I take my medication I can see how I fall neatly into the cogs of society .
3622,Then I stop taking the medication.
3623,Alcohol becomes my new medication but it only calms me so much.
3624,"I've always hated taking medication, even painkillers for headaches, I'd rather grit my teeth and bear through it."
3625,We've been experiencing a long/cold Spring and at first I thought that was it since I'm fed up with it but now I'm thinking it' the meds.
3626,I'm also tired of guinea pigging these meds.
3627,"Yea, I take my medicine like I'm supposed to."
3628,Telling myself that one day the meds will work again or that I will actually be a functioning part of society just all sounds like lies.
3629,"I'm a 22 year old student, I've suffered with depression for years, have been on Prozac for about a year or a year and a half, I was off meds for a while before that and had been on Lexapro for a while previously."
3630,"It might be because I moved home from school and I'm adjusting to the environment, but I think it is coming from the medication too."
3631,I was diagnosed in Sept. and started taking meds.
3632,"I've been on several dozen medications over the course of 8 years for bipolar, bpd, schizoaffective, GAD, panic disorder, every diagnosis they switch to or add on brings another medication change."
3633,Every hospital visit warrants a change in medication even if it is helping my mood and behavior 95% of the time.
3634,"I am on my parent's insurance, they pay my bills for the most part since I can't work anymore, and they very much control everything to do with my psychiatrist and medications."
3635,My mom persuaded my newer psychiatrist to take me off 4 of my medications because they don't believe I need those ones and not that many.
3636,"My mom ""trains"" me to tell him that I'm doing just fine so he won't change my meds or prescribe new ones."
3637,"If I do have to, I'm not allowed to request a change in meds or my parents will refuse to fill it."
3638,"They already don't give me my medication consistently, believing it's my responsibility even though I don't have access to them."
3639,I have had several severe episodes since coming out of the hospital last month and being dropped off several medications.
3640,"Interestingly, my doc has given me 3 choices of starting medications - lithium, lamotrigine, and abilify."
3641,Could the trouble I am having be related to the medication or the depression or am I just a lazy sack of crap?
3642,And then I realize I've been on my crazy meds this whole time and any child would be severely deformed and unhealthy and I won't be able to keep it.
3643,"Somewhat against my original wishes, and without meaningfully informed consent, I began taking Latuda, a newer atypical antipsychotic, acquiescing to the treatment only after a voice in my head (belonging to, I shit you not, the immortal extraterrestrial vampire Virgin Mary, and by the way, also the occult basis behind V in Alan Moore's *V for Vendetta*) told me that the pills were ""power medicine"" and would level up my defenses against Aleister Crowley's malign army of sorcerers, who counted my ex-girlfriend among their number."
3644,"The medicine induced spells of creeping, suffocating anxiety and depression for several hours after dosing, a feeling of being drowned in a dim, molasses-thick malaise."
3645,They all lived together last year as well and everything was more or less fine as he was taking all of his prescribed medication (an antidepressant as well as some other kind of mood stabilizer for his bipolar disorder).
3646,"He says he is still on the bipolar medication, but has been having manic episodes and other strange behavior recently and we are concerned he may have stopped taking his bipolar medication as well."
3647,"Besides that, he's told me on a couple of occasions that I might want to see a psychiatrist for meds (he gave me the option though - try meds with therapy or therapy only) which I refused."
3648,"So members of r/bipolar, my question for you is before you had your meds under control, how did you handle responsibilities of uni and/or a job?"
3649,I am stuck in this place forever and while my meds help me and keep me level if one card is remove on my delicate house of cards I'm right back at square one.
3650,At 30 years old this is the first time I've ever taken any meds for mental health issues.
3651,"My doctor wants to reevaluate my meds after I'm sober and he wants me to join AA or another support group, but I probably won't."
3652,Due to falling into the gap with medicare I am going to be without my meds for about a week.
3653,I don't really sleep without my meds so come Turkey day there will be a string of all nighters.
3654,Anyone have any coping skills to use when not on meds?
3655,"Been on a series of failed meds including seroquel, abilify, lamictal, countless antidepressants."
3656,But he refused to prescribe anti-anxiety medication.
3657,"She told me that due to my frequent and debilitating panic attacks, my suicidality, my bipolar disorder, and my unmanaged psych meds, I should be in the hospital."
3658,"so i want to know if anyone else has tried this medication, and if so what was it like for you?"
3659,I have told my psychiatrist this and all he does is keeping upping the dose of my meds.
3660,I've tried multiple sleep medications and that does not work.
3661,Simply put-- did you lose your creative spark when your medicine started to kick in?
3662,I'm scared when I get my meds I'll become uncreative.
3663,"I've done my stints in inpatient and am now ""stable"" on meds steadily without change for a while."
3664,"(I've been on a great mix of medicine that's let me do school and work this semester for the first time in a long while, so this was unusual.)"
3665,"I resent medication/drugs as a whole, because of seeing my mother abuse them for so long, so I am generally not a medication-happy person."
3666,I have been on and off medications since the age of 17.
3667,"My psychiatrist says, almost in a joking way but not really cause it's true, ""You've been through every medication in the pharmacy, there is nothing more!"""
3668,"The best medication in my opinion, and this is such a grey area, medical marijuana."
3669,Anyways with all that being said I've been off all pharmaceutical medications for the passed 9 months.
3670,https://realmedication.wordpress.com/2015/08/13/my-take-on-bi-polar-1-and-bi-polar-2/
3671,Tomorrow morning i am finally taking a psych evaluation and I hope they find something and can put me on some kind of medication because I don't know how much more I can deal with this.
3672,For the past few years I've been depressed and had it diagnosed by a doctor but didn't get any medication or further treatment for a few reasons.
3673,"The dozens of meds they describe, what works, what doesn't work."
3674,"I need everyone's thoughts here, why you think (or know) this disorder fits you, and how you justify the meds."
3675,"I'm not being cynical, honestly, it's just that it's so hard for me to accept something which in my heart knows doesn't exist, yet because of my lot in life, I can't afford to get a second opinion, and medication is not only unattainable ($$$), I have a deep fear of them down to a fundamental level."
3676,"Edit: In short, just express yourself as honest as possible, you could give me anything to what your last episode was like, how it made you feel, what went through your thought process, the meds you take or lack there of, anything to give me perspective."
3677,I currently am not on medication and have always struggled believing that I truly have bipolar.
3678,But still I wonder if this is something I can overcome on my own without medicine.
3679,(I've been on meds before.
3680,"I hate my mood swings, meds every day...I'm not as sharp as I used to be, but, oh well."
3681,I've been off my meds for 5 months without relapsing or really coming close to relapsing.
3682,I've gone off of meds a few times and it has had desasterous and dangerous consiquences... hospitalized twice after doing so within months of each other.
3683,Hopefully something I say will help those both taking and not taking medication.
3684,"There are probably some great medications to help people with depression, you can ask your doctor about that... but if you can hold out things do get better and it's up to you to decide what's best for you."
3685,"Now, Mania, what a beast of an issue for someone who doesn't take medication... First things are definitely to make sure you can eat and sleep."
3686,"But man, I've never pulled it off... from full blown Manic (or as far gone as I was) there's probably no way back without medication."
3687,If you ever have a manic episode I would look into getting sleep-meds...
3688,I got prescription sleep-meds and I always keep them just in case.
3689,"I tend to do it on the last day or two of my time in the hospital...

Coming off of meds, do it the way your doctor recomends, I never did... but remember I'm not your role model..."
3690,I ended up calling 911 from a payphone in my boxers and a Great Excape hoody because I came off my meds early and abruptly.
3691,"It reminds you to take your meds, while giving you important info about them."
3692,Last time I was actively considering ending my life was when I came off all of my medications for some stupid reason.
3693,This time I'm taking my medications.
3694,"But even with all that, a weird and terrible part of me dreads the meds."
3695,"I take medicines not for my wellbeing but for your safety, thats what people dont understand."
3696,I have been depressed for the last two years and now my doctor back home (India) tells me that I am Bipolar type two and I am on meds for that.
3697,Been on medicine for like a month and the noise is gone most of the days.
3698,This is so bad that I don't know what the hell to tell my psychiatrist when she asks if my meds are working or not.
3699,"""Have you taken your medicine?"""
3700,I shoved every emotion or retort down and brought him my medicine box with it's cute little AM/PM boxes for the week.
3701,"Reality still exists, no amount of meds makes that go away for me."
3702,"TL;DR  ""Did you take your meds?"""
3703,He said he doesn’t want to be on meds because it makes him feel numb.
3704,I hate having to take medication but I guess it helps.
3705,I'm just so miserable at home and I think about killing/hurting myself a lot and just taking a bunch of my medication with alcohol at one time hoping that will stop the pain I've been holding in for so long.
3706,He hasn't been able to get more medication in four months.
3707,At least this way he can get help and get back on meds.
3708,""", medication adjustments--my entire human experience takes place against the context of my brain's ""special"" responses to its ""special spice"" brain chemistry."
3709,"Actually, fuck western medicine guys."
3710,"In those more extreme cases earlier this year, my pdoc isn't quite sure what they are or why I've started having them, and as a result has added in gabapentin and more klonopin to my nightly meds, I suppose to just try to sedate me more so I'm asleep before it has a chance to start."
3711,"The problem is that now every night I've taken my handful of meds and put on some netflix while I wait for them to kick in, like I usually do, but at the point where I start feeling a little drowsy I keep thinking/feeling things that aren't real."
3712,I've also taken hydroxzine which is my daily anxiety medicine.
3713,I have an appointment to get a review for meds in 3 weeks.
3714,"I'm pretty comfortable with my medications, but I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on surviving/thriving in college with bipolar."
3715,"(hey so this is my first reddit post, but i found this posts on this subreddit superhelpful and comforting to read in january/february just after i was diagnosed as bipolar so THANK YOU)
I've been on meds for bipolar since january, began taking lithium in mid-march, just before my 21st birthday, and it's made me SO much better: i've been able to get a full-time job (after dropping out of oxford uni in march), have felt really healthy, and have been very lucky to experience very few side effects."
3716,"Anyone else with experience of feeling hypomanic on meds / of taking lithium / whatever, plz help"
3717,I told him about my disorder and how I valued our friendship and how I wanted to be a good friend for him (I was heavy on the friend thing) but that I needed some time for my new medication to kick in.
3718,I sent him a short email going back to good-bye and saying that I’d get in touch with him maybe when my new medications took hold.
3719,"In your perspective after getting on medication, what is being normal like?"
3720,My biggest fear is my doctor won't prescribe me anything and I'll go off my meds to become hypomanic.
3721,I decided to stop taking my meds.
3722,"Please don't go off your meds and decide to break up with your significant other, I've learned this the hard way!"
3723,"I become depressed, suicidal thoughts creep in, I feel the full effects of brain fog, I have real problems forming thoughts, losing my train of thought, and finding words, and most of all I want to stop taking my meds."
3724,"I'm normally a very rational person, but right now I want to quit the meds cold turkey because it doesn't feel like they're doing anything."
3725,"I have gone two my meds Dr maybe five times,.and my tharapist for a year now."
3726,"I have been controlling my BP quite well between the meds, early therapy and now education."
3727,"And if that doesn't pan out, I'll buy meds off the street."
3728,"Even with his meds, I still hear a little girl screaming for help in the distance when I'm laying in bed at night, but I'm very aware it is not real and therefore it rarely bothers me."
3729,I don't feel this is because of his medication.
3730,"I'm going to continue with the medication for a little longer, just until I ensure I've developed the correct habits and am not going to slip back into smoking constantly and drinking a few beers after work everyday and foolishly spending my money."
3731,Anyone ever just want to quit their meds.
3732,I just want to be me not the person the meds make me.
3733,"Before the meds I was was mostly manic, it led me to a drug addiction until I met my fiancé."
3734,I then treated myself with weed and was just as well as I am now without meds.
3735,Then I started my meds and quit smoking because of the cost.
3736,I want to go back to not being on any drugs because I just want to see my real self not the person the meds make me.
3737,"After she left the practice, I was stuck with medication that didn't work and no one to change it."
3738,"My mother was given lithium to treat her anorexia and clinical depression when she was my age -- and it worked, until she decided she was entirely better, went off her meds, and tried to kill herself."
3739,Have any of you mother bears gone off your meds and had babies?
3740,"During this time I rationed older, half-sized tablets that I used when first coming onto the medication so that I still had something, but I was basically getting 400mgs once a day compared to 500mg twice a day."
3741,"So my anxiety is way up, I'm in a depression, and now this added agitation and hypomania has me convinced I'm in the throws of a particularly bad mixed episode / relapse as the result of coming off medication."
3742,"I went to go see a new therapist today, and while he really wants to put me on medication, he offered electroshock therapy as a non-medication option."
3743,"I have never had good luck with medication, so I thought I would ask if anyone here has had firsthand experience with electroshock therapy, and could tell me if it was beneficial or not?"
3744,Im trying to find the right meds to balance my moods and was just diagnosed in july but this has been going on for awhile.
3745,Completely off my meds and I never make it a priority to take them(Lamotrigine 250mg).
3746,"After being off my meds for over a month, I finally saw my pdoc today."
3747,The first thing I told him was that I'd been off my meds for over a month.
3748,So glad to be back on my meds.
3749,"**

I know that technically it is worth being stable to have gross hair, but every once in a while it just puts me over the edge and makes me want to stop taking my meds."
3750,I have been trying several different meds within that time and nothing has worked.
3751,Over a month ago my therapist put me on a compound medication but after taking it for only a month my insurance stopped covering it and I can't afford the $800/month cost.
3752,Now I am completely off any meds and I think I'm going through withdrawals.
3753,Been on a bunch of different meds recently.
3754,I'm having tons of racing thoughts from should I just kill myself or should I stop making medication all together.
3755,"Anyways I was wondering, can the meds or one of the diagnosis cause confusion and memory loss?"
3756,"At night, I get very very anxious especially after taking my medication, and my pupils grow wildly big (even before I take my medication)."
3757,"I have been threw a slew of medications finally found abilify, which works but I cant afford."
3758,"I am extremely frustrated by medications, they always feel like a compromise."
3759,The truth is I hate medications but I need them.
3760,It helps quiet my mind and I haven't smoked since starting my medication.
3761,I don't want it to fuck with my medication but OH MAN I am so bored.
3762,"My dad's side has a history of ADHD and i have it too but meds never helped me in school (20 now, started taking them in second grade) and well I'm not sure what I'm taking now but it's helped way more than any ADHD med has."
3763,"I know she needs to be on medication with a primary care we have talked to so many people here and it seems hopeless she cant get help at all unless she hospitalizes herself, which would only be temporary, and another bill we cant afford."
3764,"I told my psychiatrist and she was talking about how, although the meds are clearly doing something (I'm not suicidal and not manic) we can fine-tune them so I start feeling better and more like myself."
3765,"Anyway, I am taking my meds as I am told and have been doing well."
3766,"I just want to know if this is common, medicine related, whatever."
3767,"Now that that rambling is done, share your positive meds stories with me!"
3768,TL;DR: Share your positive experiences about being on bipolar meds so I can stop being scared of them!
3769,Edited to add: I forgot to mention that one of my biggest concerns in taking meds is that I'll lose the creativity and artistic ability that comes with my manic cycles.
3770,"I don't know if I ever actually had ADHD, or if I was always bipolar, and I'm not sure if my mom was ever actually bipolar, or actually just an alcoholic, and I think she got off the medication because of pressure from some AA friends."
3771,Many people in AA don't believe in psych meds.
3772,"Just wondering, because I have often heard of people with Bipolar disorder going well into their 20s and sometimes 30s without ever getting a definitive diagnosis, or getting a diagnosis and spending years working out a medication combination that works for them."
3773,"Before I was on my new meds I'd only hooked up with a few guys at my University, and each time it was someone I actually met with and enjoyed the company of."
3774,"Shit happens I guess

So that didn't work (I didn't tell the doctor how bad it was because I didn't want to wind up in hospital because the fucking meds didn't work, I swear I wasn't even that bad my therapist was just worried about me because I was hella stressed and worried and everything was going a little bit grey again but it was okay and anyway she told me to ask the GP for antidepressants."
3775,"The meds make the pain go away, but it's only temporary."
3776,I've tried every medication the doctors thought could help and it's doing nothing.
3777,I told my family about my depression and the medication I was taking both of which I had been hiding from them for years.
3778,The doctor gave me some medication and gave me some time with my family before I went in.
3779,"He talked me down a bit, helped me relax, and I started to get drowsy as the medication started to work."
3780,They just prescribed me medication and I just took it with the mindset that they wouldn't prescribe something unless they thought it would help and I was desperate for relief.
3781,I hopped on the computer and googled the medication I was taking along with the symptoms of schizophrenia but I didn't really feel affected by this turn of events.
3782,"The medication made me extremely drowsy and foggy, my family was still in denial, I was still trying to understand the implications of my diagnosis or wondering if the diagnosis was even correct."
3783,The next couple of years I would go on and off my medication periodically.
3784,But when the symptoms would inevitably return and I would go back on medication.
3785,"Diagnosed bipolar (II I think, at least it makes more sense than I) about 15 years ago, and went through years off and on meds (mostly antidepressants) with some pretty bad side effects."
3786,"I got a script for Lamotrigine, which some quick Google-fu shows to be more of an anti-bipolar medicine (but with placebo studies that seem to make it less effective than initially thought)."
3787,"My meds I think have finally started to really work, and I was just put on Adderall."
3788,"All of this of course, was during a manic phase before I was diagnosed and while I was off my depression meds."
3789,"I don't remember what exactly happened, it was all a blue of emotional brain and new meds."
3790,"A few weeks later, after I got on the correct meds and I worked through a lot of my problems I again reached out to her, this time to talk to her with a level head."
3791,"Whelp, the good news is, the medication seems to be working with regards to the mood swings, at least I think they are."
3792,"She's scared about the medicine, I'm terrified of talking to the doctor."
3793,"Have any of you had any crazy things happen with the first medication they put you on, or have you had to go through several?"
3794,"She's worried about not getting the right medicine since I'll start college this fall, but I'm not sure anything could actually be much worse, just a different kind of bad."
3795,So I am considering going off my meds.
3796,"Can your dog really sense you emotions and respond (like getting you to take medication when in panic, yes I know this is the bipolar subreddit but other examples aren't coming to my friend mind)?"
3797,Do they remind you to take your meds everyday at the same time?
3798,My cocktail of prescribed meds have worked well for a while.
3799,I'll take my meds now and hope things go back to normal.
3800,"The thing I hate the most about Bipolar is not the immense pain, or all the meds I have to take, or the social isolation."
3801,It is my third day on my new medication; I am feeling more in control.
3802,I’m hesitant to put it down to the medication; it may be due to just feeling better about myself for finally going to the Doctor and feeling a little more in control.
3803,"In talking to the Doctor, starting new meds and generally having animated and positive conversations with my boyfriend, I’ve been feeling quite good."
3804,"Again, I’m unsure if this is because of the medication or because I feel proud of myself for taking some positive steps, and [boyfriend] seems happier too since he’s sought help for his own mental health (depression)."
3805,Just wondering if theres people with bipolar disorder who dont use medication and dont have any episodes or very few.
3806,My sex drive is shot because of the medication and I can't seem to enjoy anything.
3807,"When I'm off medication everything is incredible, but now I feel so hopeless because my moods and anxiety are stable but I can't enjoy normal life the way other people or my loving partner can...I'm frustrated."
3808,"My job out of college at Oracle lasted 9 months, ending with a manic episode when I went off my meds (dumb move)."
3809,"If my SO tries to give me my meds, i will take them in my mouth, pretend i have swallowed them and then spit them out."
3810,I don't have health insurance right now so I can't see doctor or go on any medications for it.
3811,I have been taking medication for the bipolar and it completely keeps me stable (although I do miss my manic states) but I fell powerless when winter comes around.
3812,"Beyond that, after starting the medicine things were just off."
3813,The first time was maybe a month or so after she started the medicine.
3814,The nurse eventually called her back and doubled her medication.
3815,"After that, she went to her regular appointment and the doctor added Wellbutrin to her list of medications."
3816,"She told the nurse she needed to speak to the doctor, things weren't right, she was feeling manic, and finally the nurse called back, removed the Wellbutrin, and added a new medicine that I had never heard of."
3817,"I started to think I was wrong about it being the medicine, I started to think I was a bad person."
3818,I have been through a few doctors had my meds played with enough that I have a good cocktail.
3819,I've been trying so hard to concentrate and have added an anti-psychotic which has helped my panic attacks but no matter how much better I've gotten with therapy and meds it doesn't seem to help my work performance.
3820,"I've been taking the same meds for four years now, the dosage only altered when some derpy shrink with only one visit's assessment has arsed it up."
3821,"Today this doctor had a go at me for not trialling the medication, despite what I said to him and in his own fucking words on the referral to this new psychiatrist....

To top it off he even mentioned my cardiac history, but yet I should be taking citalopram (on its own)."
3822,"To make matters worse, I am unmedicated right now (aside from self medication, which is bad I know) and the new psychiatrist appointment is in a month (22nd March)."
3823,The kicker is that I have been off my meds for this long.
3824,"I went into the Doc about a month and a half ago, and they had put me on lithium in combination with my other meds."
3825,"I have had some severe episodes in the past but have been feeling relatively good since I've been off the meds, and have gotten better since being diagnosed a few years ago at recognizing when I'm not feeling myself."
3826,I guess I just want to know if I could in theory manage this without the meds.
3827,I have a lot to cover and I know that a lot of this meeting will be rather austere; what medications do I take?
3828,I have gone without meds or professional management since I was 15.
3829,"A lot of this stuff is just stigma and won't actually impact my experiences, though it has impacted my meds (relying on lithium instead of lamictal)."
3830,"I had not realized that medication was just a part of maintenance until I had a doctor tell me there were three aspects to mental health:  The sociological, biological, and environmental."
3831,I had the biological part in hand with medication that monitored the chemical production.
3832,And an unrelated question: Is ones medication an indicator of how severe ones bi-polar is?
3833,"Why would I take medication to fade this out, to be more passive?"
3834,"I have recently been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, I found I was able to be consistent on my  medication for a month or two, but its hard to stay on it when I feel better."
3835,Should I just find somewhere to stay for a week as she gets used to this medication?
3836,"So I've started medication finally and it seems to be working I guess, definately more level but it might need a tweak."
3837,"My mom is actively against medication for it and is always affraid of it, my dad is always talking about X study that solved people's ""learned depression"" with out meds."
3838,"My SO is always bringing up ""when are you going off your meds?"""
3839,and also brings up studies about no meds.
3840,I never wanted to go on meds!
3841,"But guess what, this medicine lets me function."
3842,"To try and justify taking the meds is hard enough, having to figure out if they're working or not is even harder as I don't realize what's happening to my mood and behavior if I'm in the thick of it."
3843,How have you guys gotten people to back off from suggesting you don't need meds or should try some sort of alternative?
3844,What was it like for you when you started medication?
3845,How do you deal with people you love suggesting alternatives to your meds?
3846,So I went to my doc today to ask to be put back on my meds.
3847,He took me off my meds on my first visit and told me on my first visit that I was misdiagnosed bipolar because of my past sexual abuse as a child.
3848,I asked him to put me back on my meds because I am feeling depressed.
3849,My doc has only given me enough meds for a week until I see him again.
3850,He says I have to do his therapy for me to get any more meds from him.
3851,the other meds for years.
3852,Still taking meds but too broke to go see my doctor.
3853,I used to hate the idea of being on medication and thought it was even worse to be on multiple medications.
3854,Is there anything wrong with all the medications I'm on?
3855,"Including diet, fitness, health, meditating, massage, meds to talk to my doc about, whatever."
3856,"Since all of this has happened, the only drug I still use is marijuana, I still haven't tried any meds, but I have done quite a bit of CBT with a therapist."
3857,If she won't work with me I'm really considering having my pcp manage my meds.
3858,Anybody have any medications they like so I can discuss them with my doctor?
3859,"I'm prepared to talk it through with a new doctor, but there's another underlying issue - I'm afraid I'll just be prescribed medication, which I can't take."
3860,"For the entire of my life, I have never been able to swallow tablets, or take soluble tablets in water - in fact the only medication I've ever been able to take with no real problems is Calpol (Yes, I'm 22 and I still have Calpol for a painkiller) and various nasal sprays."
3861,"I think the fact that I know I have bipolar is enough, even though everyone says medication is a must."
3862,i've not been to a doctor or ever been on a medicine.
3863,"On the other hand, my psychiatrist, who used my psychologist's observation results made a ""paranoid schizophrenia"" diagnosis, and got me on anti-psychotic medication."
3864,My GP said that I don't manifest any symptoms of schizophrenia (and never did) and ordered me to get off the anti-psychotic medication after asking my family members some questions about my behavior and symptoms.
3865,"He printed out official documents which ordered me to gradually reduce the dose of my anti-psychotic medication, and then stop taking it completely."
3866,At first I was diagnosed with depression and tried several medications and none worked.
3867,I've been taking it for two years- is it time to switch medications?
3868,"I want this fucking disease to disappear along with me

(and before anyone says anything, yes I am on meds and do therapy to try and help)"
3869,Like they're just too low to start taking their medicine or too lazy to remember and it just gets worse and worse.
3870,"I want to start all my new medicines that will help me, I really do, I'm just feeling anxious about getting out of my slump."
3871,"I had felt fine for about two years on my current medication, so when it started to feel like I was going to relapse, I panicked."
3872,The medications have slowly increased since then.
3873,I took my current (and so far first/only) medication for my bipolar disorder just now for the first time since February.
3874,"I'm sure this is like a broken record, but i've gone through many different medications without success."
3875,I actually go through phases where I stop going to my Pdoc and go off meds.
3876,I feel like my ptsd and grief of losing my father mimicked symptoms of bipolar and the meds I have been subscribed help diminish the symptoms.
3877,I don't want to be on meds the rest of my life.
3878,"I'm scared to stop my meds, but I'm terrified to stay on them."
3879,i've found meds that don't work for me.
3880,"Here are some of the highlights from our conversations:

- She was apparently depressed once (though never diagnosed) and thought her way out of it, so I should do the same;

- I don't 'seem like I have bipolar disorder', so my psychiatrist is wrong;

- I've had to change medications a lot - mostly before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, so we were trying to treat the wrong thing - so all psychotropic drugs are obviously a scam perpetrated by Big Pharma;

- There are 'proven' natural remedies for bipolar disorder;

- Similarly, bipolar disorder is 'caused by a lack of vitamins and minerals';

- My suicide attempts were not genuine or something(???)"
3881,His mother informed me he has had a few violent mental breakdowns and has been diagnosed bipolar disorder (I don't know what type) and on top of everything he refuses to take his medication.
3882,I visit a therapist and psychiatrist regularly and we are trying to find a medication that will work for me.
3883,"I tend to have the seasons affect my mood shifts, so right now I am pretty severely depressed, regardless of my medication."
3884,"Anyway, she started doing his almost immediately upon changing medication and we were wondering if any of you had experienced similar symptoms?"
3885,Finally got a hold of my shrink.... After he freaked out I was on medicine he didn't prescribe me then I reminded him he had me committed because his meds made me go crazy he finally talked with.
3886,He finally understood I don't react normally to medicines!!!
3887,I missed a lot of work because of drug side effects and the hospital stay and she is afraid I won't be able to afford my meds.
3888,I am suspecting Bi-Polar 2 - any advice from people who have it with/without meds?
3889,"[Told](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/21z76t/when_is_anxiety_enough_to_get_on_medication/) to crosspost this from /r/anxiety over to here, so here goes."
3890,I have handled certain situations very well that would have normally thrown me into an episode; but it's only been 3 weeks since my diagnosis/since I started medication.
3891,"**

Is my anxiety bad enough on its own to get on medication?"
3892,"I've read a lot of anxiety medication is addicting, and so I wonder if maybe mine isn't that bad, if I can just live with it, but I don't know..."
3893,"My focus is on medication, and when is one actually necessary."
3894,"My focus is on medication, and when is one actually necessary."
3895,"I recently quit my job to get help ad I've been In therapy once a week and been on meds for about a week but it isn't really helping, I'm so sad and so lost and hopeless and life just seems meaningless."
3896,Is there medicine that keeps me on my high and keeps me focused.
3897,I am finally more sociable thanks to some other Anxiety medicine.
3898,What medicine should I take to stay high.
3899,Just tell me what medications I should ask my psychiatrist to prescribe.
3900,I need to some advice and to see if my meds need to be readjusted.
3901,"If you're on medication, do you still get episodes, they just aren't as intense?"
3902,"I have been taking the same medications and still attending regular appointments with a therapist,however, I still feel my mental health is not where it needs to me."
3903,"It's called the Scar Hypothesis- basically it says that over time hospitalization, depression, manic episodes, medication, psychotherapy, and painful events can so fundamentally change a person even after the depression is gone."
3904,i remember when i was first diagnosed for depression 10 years ago that i was told the meds are temporary and its not good for me to be on them for long periods of time.
3905,now meds are a part of my daily life.
3906,"On an average night when I'm stable (which I am lucky to be most of the time thanks to working meds), I sleep about 5 hours."
3907,I would like to offer support for other people who just don't feel like themselves on meds or who are trying to treat their bipolar without psychotropics.
3908,"In October, i was hospitalized and in a coma for a week because someone ghb'd me at a party - it did not mix well with my medication."
3909,"After I recovered from the coma, the hospital dr recommended I be removed or have the dosage lowered from my meds."
3910,"I'm just really pissed off about all this that's been going on so I guess I'm behaving kinda like a kid and being like ""fine, I won't take my meds."""
3911,"Two emergency room visits later, and the docs agree that it's an atypical allergic reaction to my meds."
3912,Any one else have to go through a medication reaction?
3913,Finally cracked down on my medication which has helped.
3914,"Geodon was bad for me, a really bad medicine for me."
3915,"i very recently went through a medicine change (add abilify to (seroquel, cymbalta, lamictol)) that threw me into mania."
3916,"Like, do you not take medication or go to counselling/therapy?"
3917,I'm just wondering because I'm hoping to be diagnosed soon and I don't want medication or counselling.
3918,"Also, I'm about to be put on some medicine (lithium maybe?)"
3919,I don't want to take medication and I'm afraid.
3920,"Hey guys, I was diagnosed with Bi polar Disorder in 2012 and through these 2 years i have gone through a multitude number of emotional bouts and I've struggled with quite a few issues and decided to write a blog about how I've been, felt and changed while on and off medication, the highs and Lows as well, I will be updating you all while I'm on my journey through it all on this blog I started."
3921,"- I have taken 7,300 doses of my meds over 20 years
- I have ingested over 20 kilograms of lithium
- I have ingested of 2 kg of Prozac

So missing a dose?"
3922,"Recently, I started doing research into doctors and medicines and things I can do to help overcome and control bipolar."
3923,"I feel like I often see others here, and on the other subreddit, that are on ADD medication."
3924,So I've been on/off meds for quite a while now so this probably makes my side effects worse.
3925,They are becoming a pretty regular occurrence despite my medication.
3926,"Anything I experience that isn't ""regular bipolar"" becomes ammo in my head for why I should stop medication or therapy."
3927,The other day you said maybe I should go off meds.(untrue).
3928,Not being able to work has made me reconsider going back on medication.
3929,"Ok since I have been diagnose with bipolar disorder, I have been trying out a few different medications."
3930,She was really concerned since I was on medication.
3931,"He is currently on medication, but is having a depressive episode."
3932,"I know bipolar cannot be helped without medication, but does anyone have any tips or ideas on what I could try until my appointment?"
3933,"The therapist ""freaked out"" and said that she was bipolar and needed to change medication now."
3934,Went off my meds two weeks ago.
3935,I started back on the meds Monday but I imagine they'll take a while to kick in.
3936,Remember people: take your meds!!
3937,"I have a psychiatrist right now, but meds aren't helping."
3938,"Obviously I'm not about to self prescribe anything, but I'm really worried about side effects - it's what turned me off completely to medication in the past."
3939,"What medications have you found come with the least side effects, and what side effects are they?"
3940,"I take 1 medication that helps me sleep and somewhat normals me out but I still have episodes of anxiety, panic, depression."
3941,She got diagnosed with inattentive adhd a couple years ago and the medicine really seemed to help with school work.
3942,So a few weeks ago she relapsed into drinking alcohol and stopped taking her meds.
3943,They got her sobered up and back on meds.
3944,I'll be the boring zombie I am on medication and accept all the awful side effects that go with it.
3945,"""If you're on the right medication you won't feel like a zombie!"
3946,"Maybe that is true, but I have done extensive research on all the medication available to treat my disorder and have been prescribed by the best psychiatrist in my area."
3947,"I've been on my meds for over a year now, uninterrupted."
3948,I was in pretty bad shape before the meds kicked in.
3949,"I stopped taking it about 6 months ago (along with all my meds) and at this point, it's hard to imagine why."
3950,i go back today for a check in and to see how my meds are going/if i need adjusting.
3951,I just got back on medication and it is keeping me somewhat calm.
3952,My Bipolar 2 and Psychosis are getting really bad and I'm starting to think the medication isn't helping anymore but that's just me probably being delusional.
3953,I know it's not a good idea with the medication but I need a night to just fuck everything up.
3954,"I'm sorry if that's not the right word, I've only recently been diagnosed and recently got on medication."
3955,I don't know anything about what medicines she's on (my father handles all of that).
3956,"She fights taking the meds as well, saying they cause her symptoms."
3957,So I know that no one here can give med advice or advise any medication use but I have a HYPOTHETICAL question.
3958,I'm starting to wonder if my motivation for anything has just completely died or if its the meds.
3959,"Whilst I didn't tell him about the recent intensity of my suicide fantasies and plans, I did confess to struggling with taking my meds and to hallucinating."
3960,I cannot take my meds.
3961,"The doctor said to take a benadryl with the medicine to reduce nighttime muscle aches, but this hurts soo badly."
3962,"I dont want any medication, I dont know why but I want to deal with this myself."
3963,"Anyways, I dont want medication, I dont want to have to be forced into therapy or anything."
3964,"My pdoc is managing my meds, but I feel like I need some sort of therapy as well."
3965,"I am tired of the medications because all they have done is bring me painful, brutally honest clarity."
3966,"So, yes, I guess I can't say the meds haven't been doing *something*."
3967,"Auras, crawly feelings under the skin, feeling boxed in.. 
Oh how I LOVE how my Mirena IUD and my medication interact."
3968,"I thought I had finally accepted it, after a few months in...then my meds ran out and I became this person I wouldn't think I would ever be: super unmotivated, uninterested in any of my passions, uninterested in talking to anyone I care about, and uninterested in doing everything (unless it was self- medicating)."
3969,My medication (lamictal) was trying to stop it from happening but it wasn't doing the job by itself.
3970,The medicine is starting to help and I'm hopeful that it will.
3971,"Thankfully, I am under care of a psychiatrist who has adjusted my medication, and a counselor who has provided me more frequent visits."
3972,This sounds like a lot of what we talk about...how life events can trigger mood changes even if our meds stay the same: http://psychcentral.com/lib/2009/interpersonal-and-social-rhythm-therapy/ -
3973,Not to mention the fact that I have no idea how the hell I'm going to be able to afford said medication in the first place.
3974,Can I blame the meds like I always do?
3975,It was the only medication I've been on in my life that did what it was supposed to without any immediately depressing side effects.
3976,I'm worried that without the Lithium I'm going to be back to being a test monkey for random assorted meds like I was before.
3977,"In that case, I would be better off being unmedicated because I was every bit as unstable on those meds as I was off of them."
3978,"I am considering getting back on the pharmaceuticals just to get through the wedding, but frankly I hate the meds and my fiancé and I would like to try for children as soon as we are married and I don’t want that junk in my system if we are trying to get pregnant."
3979,I don’t know if I should get on the hardcore medication just to make it through the wedding or not.
3980,"He was on a lot of medication, wich honestly onle seemed to mess him up even more, as they were always changing the dose to find the right amount, but that right amount never seemed to exist, and so the swing simply got worse and worse."
3981,I just got back on my meds.
3982,To date 3 weeks is the longest I have ever stayed on meds.
3983,I'm still getting used to the medication.
3984,"Even with good health insurance, I can't afford the constant doctor visits, tests, and meds (that don't seem to do jack shit)."
3985,"Turns out, if I am terminated over this, I can get a bunch of unemployment from them with documentation I'm getting treatment and that I'm taking my meds, giving me plenty of time to find a new job."
3986,"It makes me a bit shaky the next day though, but I don't plan on going off the meds."
3987,Since my recent diagnosis I have been on two medications which both worked TERRIBLY considering I also have Panic disorder.
3988,"I was wanting a cure for depersonalization, and I requested specific medicine from him."
3989,"Suggestions on resources, or have you found meds that help you keep your energy or libido?"
3990,"Before my medication, I had SO many manic periods as I'm sure you all have experienced."
3991,I'm not going to stop my medication.
3992,"I experience times of extreme highs and lows so that I have to take medication, be very wary of my emotions/behavior, and go through practices that are aimed to help me reach stability

-I'm balanced

5.)"
3993,"I had to be hospitalized inpatient twice for depression in less than a month and while I was manic, I was in outpatient to try to keep me on meds and under control."
3994,The bipolar is and having structure and staying on meds is a problem.
3995,"**Why I am here :**

 

I've recentely been diagnosed with BP, I was told I was on the BP specturm and he'd like a more indepth interview and to come back if my moods worsen, as well as being offered medication at the time, I refused the medication at the time and didn't go back to my pdoc (mainly because I moved country without telling him, not manic I promise)."
3996,But at the time I didn't feel ill and I was quite angry at just being shoved meds.
3997,"In Jan, my pdoc diagnosed me as being on the bipolar specturm and offered meds and said he'd have a longer/in-depth follow up in 6 weeks."
3998,I refused meds and haven't returned since.
3999,"He'll likely come home from the hospital tomorrow, provided I agree and he's been put on meds (I don't know which)."
4000,"So apparently they are now able to do a genetic test that will show your psychiatrist what medications would work best, what medications might be metabolized different than normal, and which medications should be avoided."
4001,"According to the website: ""GeneSight analyzes a patient’s genes and provides individualized information to help healthcare providers select medications that better match their patient’s genes""

THE FUTURE IS NOW."
4002,"But this past year, since I got on the right meds and became more self sufficient (I actually make about 3x what he does now), it's like he's grown to hate me."
4003,Have you ever lost weight by stopping your medications abruptly?
4004,Lastly what medications have caused you the most significant weight gain?
4005,I feel competent enough to deal with my life now without continuous medication.
4006,I have to imagine I'm not alone in needing medication to sleep.
4007,"I'm taking ADHD meds at the moment and that's helping a bit, but not for the highs and lows just the focusing issues."
4008,She's bipolar and has a war chest of prescription medications.
4009,"I worried about any number of bad scenarios happening such as: Dosing him with prescription glaucoma drops, giving him expired or contaminated medication, confusing eye drops with drops for swimmer's ear, etc."
4010,She's mixed up her own medications several times before and ended up very sick as a result.
4011,I can't afford my therapist or my meds anymore and that sucks because I've never been this depressed in my entire life.
4012,My heads kind of cloudy right now because I've just started a new medication so please bear with me.
4013,And this isn't the first time this has happened since beginning the medication.
4014,I was embarrassed to see a psychiatrist and unfortunately obtained my meds through a PCP.
4015,I'm on medication but I still feel like I'm swinging up and down.
4016,"However, my doctor completely flipped my meds."
4017,I've tried a few diff meds that didn't help.
4018,Trying meds to get me to this point almost broke me.
4019,"I feel like if I just get on the right medicine, everything can be better."
4020,"I have resources to help me, but I'm afraid to take steps to get counseling or get back on meds."
4021,"Now, I understand she has been given this diagnosis and is on fairly strong medication which is being administered by my parents."
4022,The doctor did want to admit her to a psyche ward for a week so her medication could be corrected but the family decided that home care would be more suitable.
4023,Should she be under house arrest until the meds start working.
4024,Has anyone taken any medications that have helped with this problem?
4025,Does anybody here take Ritalin because of side effects of their meds?
4026,"I was contemplating suicide, inpatient, or stopping taking my meds (maybe the new antipsychotic is the reason I feel so..."
4027,"The thing is, prior to these medications, we'd both have orgasms all the time."
4028,"Although we know using drugs/tampering with meds can lead to regaining the ability to orgasm, we are both firmly against those actions."
4029,even though I've had this diagnosis for almost a year now and I've been taking meds for six months.
4030,"I'm usually really good about taking my medication, but I got pretty caught up in school this week with midterms coming up and missed two days of my medication."
4031,"I took my medicine today but can someone tell me, can Lamictal really leave you system that quickly?"
4032,"Any of my other medications, if I missed a day or two I didn't really notice a difference."
4033,I guess part of what I'm having trouble adjusting to is being on medication and being stuck with this disorder for my entire life.
4034,Do they let you take your meds there?
4035,If I said fuck it for the next month and stopped my meds and stopped filtering myself I would absolutely destroy my life.
4036,"I feel so helpless and desperate, I will turn into a psychotic mess without this medication."
4037,The problem is every other drug has caused reactions except for this class of medicine :(
4038,"I noticed a word I did not expect to see and looked closer ""these medications may cause excessive salivating: blabladinol, raspberrinol, lithium, sodiu-... ""

*lithium*

Shit.. Haha"
4039,"I have been mistreated, misdiagnosed and filled with different medications (around 30+ different types I'm sure)."
4040,"The most recent one made me feel so incredible terrible in my body for several weeks, then the doctors didn't give me a new prescription for 2-3 weeks (because they forgot...) and I have been completely off the medication ever since."
4041,Can you manage to live without medication?
4042,"What scares me is having to go through the meds, eventually."
4043,"I couldn't find much when I searched myself, but I'd like a little reassurance that my heart isn't going to spontaneously combust because of my meds."
4044,I am interested here in the use of medication over the long term.
4045,"A big milestone in all of this, I just managed to spend the last year without any medication."
4046,"I did however promise myself that as soon as I caught even a hint of symptoms that I couldn't control, I would jump right back on meds."
4047,"Well, of course, as of a couple days ago, I started noticing some changes in mood and I immediately got back on meds."
4048,I plan to take these meds until I deem myself stable enough to stop again.
4049,"Put it this way: a while ago, I watched a video of a shrink talking about Major Depression where they said that taking medication for life was not something these individuals should do."
4050,She pointed out that she hoped to be able to get off her medication but stated that in her case it was an impossibility because her symptoms returned almost immediately after she stopped.
4051,I'd like to believe that I have overcome incredible hurdles and can enjoy a life of medication as maintenance.
4052,Can I assume that as long as I remain vigilant I can continue taking meds as needed rather than daily?
4053,I just feel like ever since I've been on medication I've gotten dumber and dumber.
4054,I am diagnosed with bipolar 2 but for the past two years i have been off my medication (i realize now how stupid it was).
4055,"There'd be a week or two where she'd be a bit more bubbly than usual, but never the go-out-spend-a-bunch-of-money-and-party kind of manic)

She's on a pretty good cocktail of medications, Abilify Sertraline and something else, that have kept her pretty stable until this point."
4056,"I also went through 2 year period where I was clinically depressed, and medications really helped me put a floor on my thinking and stand back up."
4057,"Enter bipolar and bipolar medications, it looks like live music might be out of the question for a while."
4058,"Alcohol**
I know some of you drink on your meds and I'm still undecided."
4059,Were you placed on medication?
4060,I refilled my medication this morning for the first time this year.
4061,"I want to switch, so that I can afford my meds, but I also want to continue living a happy life."
4062,"I know one thing for sure, that this happened very less when I was on escitalopram, but the meds are changed since my doctor has changed."
4063,Maybe waiting for the new meds to kick-in?
4064,"I don't know what this is, I don't know whether it would go away from will-power and determination or from medicines."
4065,I haven't been on my meds in 4 days and I just tried it for the first time on Friday (20 mg xr) and took another 20mg(ir) about 4 hours later.
4066,"Today I have been more irritable and psychotic than I have been in over a year, when I haven't taken meds."
4067,"I don't think my meds are working, either that, or I'm taking things waaaay to hard."
4068,"My biggest worry is that any medication that effectively levels out my mood will also eliminate the times where I feel especially lively, motivated and able to make a decent amount of artwork."
4069,"(MAOI's have been shown to treat treatment resistant depression well)

I've read that for the treatment of bipolar disorder that there are two general types of medication."
4070,I'm generalizing here but what I've read was that some medications treat the mania aspect of bipolar while others treat the depressive side.
4071,What medications are prescribed to treat the depressive side of bipolar?
4072,Can any of you give me your experiences with these medications?
4073,I want to talk to my psychiatrist about these medications as an alternative to SSRIs which don't seem to work for me.
4074,"Pretty much what my post said was that my bipolar might be coming back, that I was told by my ex that I might need to see my PDOC to change my meds."
4075,My meds just got changed so I'm behaving like a jackass.
4076,I've always taken my meds and I feel fine but I'm supposed to ask for extra time on tests and I made a mistake and didn't for one test.
4077,"I am so thankful for my medication, and for medicine and all the people that did the GRE math and helped invent this medicine!"
4078,"- In December 2014, after trying every medication possible for my headaches and my bipolar highs and lows had me feeling extremely hopeless, worthless, and like my life had become meaningless, I very selfishly decided I wanted to end my life."
4079,I think i need to go back on my medication but I'm terrified of losing my ability to write software or manage IT Infrastructure again.
4080,So I gave up on all my meds about 18 months ago.
4081,She then proceeds to tell me that she would not be willing to treat me or prescribe any medications.
4082,I don't want to go off my medication.
4083,I stopped my medication a few months ago for lamictal and an anti-depressant (don't know the name) cold turkey.
4084,My therapist warned me that medication can lessen or even diminish  creativity.
4085,I didn't believe the first psychiatrist and thus didn't take meds.
4086,"After a short period of using my medication, I start to feel happy."
4087,He tells me meds might have been triggered something else.
4088,"Then, I start taking Risperdal (Risperidone) with other meds."
4089,I continue to take my meds for some months.
4090,I stop taking meds and never to return to a psychiatrist.
4091,"But, I am scared of taking those meds more than everything."
4092,I was worse than my worst times without the meds.
4093,"To the point, my gf of 2 years is undiagnosed, and refuses to seek any help and i'm 1000% sure will refuse any medication of any kind even if she is diagnosed properly."
4094,"I'm not on medication because I don't have insurance and the out-of-pocket fees are too much, but also had a lot of issues last time with my meds."
4095,"A couple years ago, I was on some combination of meds that produced ""anorgasmia""..."
4096,I've been on meds that do that too.
4097,"Try explaining to your girlfriend that you can't get it up because of the meds, not because of her."
4098,"I had things under control with some basic medications, nothing too over the top."
4099,I just was wondering if it actually helped anyone with bipolar and/or if they knew that it worked well while still taking medications.
4100,I'm on 3 meds now.
4101,Pdoc has upped and added meds and I'm still in the 'acute' phase and nothing like I was initially but still up there.
4102,"She seems totally okay with it, gets why I'm on a bunch of meds that I've occasionally had to take in meetings, and was very open to clearing up misconceptions about it."
4103,"I know it's not really possible to manage bipolar yourself, the real remedy to the illness is medication to balance the chemicals in your brain."
4104,"But, if medication isn't possible, what's the next best thing a person can do that doesn't have insurance and getting insurance isn't a possibility?"
4105,"I felt really shitty on the first week, it felt like those days that you forget to take your meds."
4106,i can hardly afford meds and took a payday loan to pay for food and now ive found out my house is sold?
4107,and i am nearly out of the next set of meds.
4108,Stopped taking those medications and I feel SO much better.
4109,I also refuse medication.
4110,"God bless the NHS) and a formal diagnosis, and more information about what exactly that entails, medication and how to deal with my troll brain."
4111,"I didn't see a point, my mood started changing, I would be motivated to help myself and take medication one week, the next I would just forget and not want to take it."
4112,"Fever still strong and chills, this morning my stomach started acting but being sick I had to pause my crohn's medication."
4113,"Just wanted to post a positive and hope it might help someone else as well.. Long story short, my meds crapped out, and I needed to see a doc stat."
4114,"I haven't been to a pdic in about 2 years, I basically start abd stop meds and don't have much faith in finding stability with minimal side effects."
4115,Or is it after you are back on meds feeling star again which allows you the ability to see things with clarity?
4116,"My head is raving a mile a minute, I'm
Tired of this, what's worse, I have myself to blame for never sticking to my meds, but once I feel better, it's like I think, this is what I'm supposed to feel like, the pills did their job now I'm fine..."
4117,I don't want to stop taking the medicine because I haven't had a chance to talk to my doctor yet and even when I do I believe he will want me to stay on the lamictal to see how it plays out in the long run (he wants me to eventually be on 200-300mg depending on how I respond to it).
4118,"Okay, I'll try to keep the background details short......A little over six months ago I finished tapering off of my long-time medicine Lamictal."
4119,I had to deal with by taking prescription meds.
4120,"I can't take ANY stimulants ADHD medicine, including Provigil which we just tried."
4121,"I'm now 23 on a good, working combo of meds."
4122,"Um, so, a little background...I'm gradually getting back up to therapeutic dose for my meds (long story), so I know that a lot of these bothersome symptoms should begin to subside in the coming days/weeks, but..."
4123,"It took three months and a suicide attempt before I saw anyone and by the time I was put on meds I was ""up"" again."
4124,I'm scared that I'm on the wrong medication and that I'm going to have to go through all that again.
4125,"I still feel like hell, and could start crying again at any moment, but I have hope today, and I'm going to make contact with my new pDoc to get my meds adjusted."
4126,"Last year, my bipolar friend finally got on the right medications to make him stable."
4127,"Besides a great deal of symptoms I've exhibited (delusions, hallucinations, grandiosity, depression, rash decisions, irritability, restlessness, etc) these past ~2 months on meds have been a rollercoaster and perhaps enough to be more wary."
4128,So I refused all medication cause I didn't even know what they were treating me for.
4129,I still haven't figured out my medication yet (about to go from 300 to 400 lamictal) so maybe that has something to do with it..?
4130,"I feel like one of those people that cries wolf, makes up imaginary mental-health issues and ends up on a plethora of meds unnecessarily."
4131,"Until I can replenish my ""meds""."
4132,"Ever since Ive taken cyroquil, I wake up all hours of the night, really annoying, Ive been off meds for atleast9 months now and still this is happening, I used to stay asleep fine until these 900 dollar assholes."
4133,I haven’t been taking any of my medications (mood stabilizer/anti-depressant) in a few months because I feel like I am not strong enough to deal with life on my own when I have to take medicines to live day-to-day life.
4134,"So while searching which of the almost-placebos has the least amount of side effects (hello weight gain), i came about interesting discussions implying some sort of anabolic effects for some medication, e.g."
4135,Some people out there knowing which medications might offer some benefit for physical performance?
4136,It has been about 2 months since I was diagnosed and started on meds.
4137,"Before sedative meds:
Sleep irregular."
4138,I just ran out of medication about 2 weeks ago.
4139,"Part of it is probably because I don't have any medication for this, but it's also during a paycheck that I need to pay rent, which I fucked up and now I can't afford rent, which isn't helping me calm down, but I'm trying."
4140,I'm just curious because I'm on 5 meds a day.
4141,Does anyone out there deal with this hell without meds successfully?
4142,I'm not a big fan of medication and I never have been.
4143,I've read meditation and omega 3 help but my research has mainly led to the fact that you have to have meds.
4144,What about 200 years ago when they didn't have meds.
4145,"Main post here:

New Diagnosis:

Multiple Organ Failure due to Lithium toxicity (even at low doses), severe additional damage to Kidneys due to Topomax."
4146,A crisis team psychiatrist is coming over in the next hour to discuss meds/treatment plan after a failed suicide attempt and extreme trauma as a result.
4147,"Depression is definitely my biggest problem, not just right now but in general so I really want that addressed with the right meds ASAP."
4148,"She tells me that shes started becoming manic and hasn't been taking her meds since March, and I know shes been going out and drinking alot."
4149,She stopped taking her meds last year and was drinking alot and ended up dissociating (she has PTSD also) and going to mental hospital for a week so I am worried about her.
4150,"Last time it was obvious she wasn't on her meds (she was depressed), but this time it wasn't."
4151,"My mom warned me the first time she stopped taking her meds that she would do it again, but I didn't want to believe her."
4152,She said my g/f is always going to think she is fine and doesn't need to be on medication which sadly I think is the truth now.
4153,Is this going off anxiety meds or being put on Geodon?
4154,"I've been seeing a psychiatrist for anxiety and depression, and after trying a couple different meds, she put me on a low dose of Lamictal for anxiety, along with Klonopin for panic attacks."
4155,"I often wonder, is the experience of 'Normal' emotions part of the 'zombifiying' feeling of long term medication."
4156,"I've been on seroquel steady at high doseages for about a year now, and the result is that I've always taken myself off the medication (in the past, i've been on and off for nearly ten years) because I find stability so 'boring'."
4157,"Whether you're switching meds, weaning off them, or haven't filled your rx, what gets you through the fog?"
4158,This is the first year of my entire life that I've ever been on medication.
4159,"When she came back, I asked her about the medicine and how we should come up with a plan to make sure she takes them such as setting an alarm and using a calendar pill container."
4160,She just brushed it off and put the medicine away.
4161,I know that by taking her medicine she will improve tremendously since she had a three month period where she was really calmed because she was taking her medicine.
4162,"So my question is, can I use a pill crusher to hide her medicine inside food?"
4163,Does anyone have experience of someone who avoids taking medicine like my mom?
4164,Idk if this is from the medicine or what but the feeling sucks.
4165,"My therapist is useless; wanting to raise my medication instead helping me learn to cope.Im stuck with him to since he is the only one my insurance cover(WellCare, I had/have a multitude of problems and my parents had a hard time with the expenses)"
4166,I don't know if it has to do with my medication or what.
4167,And not using medicines like clonazepam etc because it causes depression I have experienced.
4168,"My dad goes and picks up the pieces of my brother's life and puts them back together (like contacting his work and arranging sick leave so he won't get fired, finding wherever my brother has abandoned his car, talking with the doctors in the psych ward and with my brother's psychiatrist to adjust his meds, etc."
4169,"Some facts about the situation have come to light, like the fact that he's been using drugs when he claimed to have been sober, and that he intentionally went off of his meds because they were blocking his creativity."
4170,"The effect of being off of his meds is immediate, as he had only been off of them for a day when he decided to ditch town and his mania set in."
4171,"It seems likely that if he stays off of his meds, and if we don't intervene, he'll end up homeless or dead, but if he stays on his meds, he may die anyway."
4172,But being off medication is not an option for him if he wants to stay sane.
4173,Can anything be said to get through to him that he needs to take his meds?
4174,"edit: It is a combination of insurance, out-of-network psych/therapist visits, and meds."
4175,I usually can control my bipolar due to my medication but recently it is not helping due to the stress of the situation.
4176,For the past couple of months I was under the impression that I would be able to phase off of my medication.
4177,I knew this wouldn't be quick and I expected to wait a year or so before gradually weening off of the meds.
4178,"IE, I'll be on my meds indefinitely."
4179,Does the fog lift after a prolonged period of medication?
4180,I feel fine and I'm taking my meds.
4181,"My friend is reassuring me I'm ""normal"" which is actually more dangerous imo, because that denial causes me to go off meds and spiral."
4182,"Hello, I was diagnosed Bipolar I last December after a two week hospitalization, in which I do recall be subject to various medications."
4183,"To appease my parents, and give them peace of mind, I continued my regimen of medication, though I despised taking an anti-phycotic(Zyprexa) and began declining the medications intake as quickly as possible."
4184,"I did attempt a cold-turkey approach, but it damn near gave my Mother a heart attack, and my Father begged me to resume the medication, and so it was, I worked with my psychiatrist to lower the medication."
4185,"I expected both medications to be reduced to nothing, but slowly it became evident that my psychiatrist wasn't intending on decreasing my lithium, as such, it was to be a life long medication."
4186,"As I researched more into these medications, I found my research to be quite shocking, and I refuted the attempt to adjust my neurotransmitters."
4187,"I'm not sure if I'll tell my psychiatrist the next time I see him that I stopped the medication, though I'm sure he will ask."
4188,"TLDR;
I'm a shithead who stopped his medication, but I've been doubtful of my diagnosis  ever since it lurched from the lips of my psychiatrist."
4189,I've only been clinically depressed once and that was due to medication.
4190,"Well, firstly I am in the process of seeking medication help, but there are limitations due to my current residence in order for me to get a psychiatric evaluation."
4191,"I have been feeling hints of paranoia in her, as she claims things like: someone put a dangerous chemical in her humidifier and poured it all over her clothing, she has had her stuff stolen multiple times, someone was messing with her medications."
4192,"We have found out that she threw out all of her medications about 5 days before, as she thought someone was trying to poison her."
4193,In your opinion would something like stopping taking all medication for 5 days cause something like this?
4194,"We work together to discuss doses, medications etc."
4195,"He is the expert on what is known about the medications, effects, rates of increase and decrease, but I'm the unquestioned expert on the experience, what's going on, and when I need a change."
4196,That is an overstatement but will be changing my meds again !!!!
4197,I've had a lot of mood outbursts the last couple days and my doctors are all conflicted about my meds.
4198,Have others had memory issues associated with medication?
4199,I have been OFF my meds (Seraquel XR and Wellbutrin) since *maayybeee* around March?
4200,"--- 
When I initially went off the meds, I didn't exactly tell my doctor right away."
4201,"*(BTW: if you're wondering, YES, I did very well for these past six+ months, I ate well, exercised some, drank less, kept a better routine ANNND actually worked and provided some much needed income for my little family)*

---
I just had a tooth extracted yesterday, so I'm on some pain medication right now."
4202,I'm finally gonna get back to my medications.
4203,Which has been really helping and my dad has plans for getting me on meds and a proper diet.
4204,"I had been feeling good for about a year, been off my meds for a while, and then all of a sudden, fuckin' bouncing off the walls."
4205,It's been nagging me at the back of my mind that I haven't been taking my medication but I figured since it's summer and I felt like I was functionally manic/depressed (lol) I would start again once school starts.
4206,"Why do so many of us strive to get better, but then once we find ourselves ""stable"" with our medication, we struggle to stay on it?"
4207,I was recently fired from my job as I missed too much time dealing with medication changes and now unemployment says that I cannot work due to my medical issues.
4208,I can't afford my medication.
4209,Would a doctor refrain from prescribing additional meds if you're already on something?
4210,Do I tell them which medications I'm already on and are they going to refrain from further prescribing anything else?
4211,I had wanted to ask about ADHD meds because it is obvious to the vast majority of people in my life that I suffer from some sort of attention disorder.
4212,"I have been on and off a slew of medication since my first hospital visit, six years ago."
4213,"During the pregnancy I went medication free, besides 100mg of Seroquel at night."
4214,"I now take a few medications: 

Lithium 900mg
Seroquel 300mg extended release
Zoloft 50mg
Ativan 1mg as needed
Clonazepam 1mg as needed
(Now discontinued) Oxeazepam
Imovane 5mg

A few days ago I started hallucinating and having short term memory loss."
4215,"Now, at this moment, I am weening off the oxazepam by hospital and doctors orders as that was the only thing that was recently added to my roster of meds."
4216,Completely start fresh and add meds IF I absolutely need it.
4217,"TL;DR: My meds keep changing, I'm losing my mind and am getting worse."
4218,I know I need to increase my dosage/change medication.
4219,I suppose I'm just wondering what you guys did to cope with all this crap when you were trying to figure out your medication?
4220,Slowly it went away after numerous different meds and doctors and inpatient visits.
4221,I am not sure how to take this news as I still tell people I have it but have no symptoms of it because of the meds and my lifestyle.
4222,"i know people react differently to medications, and i was wondering if anyone had success on abilify or if its just generally a bad idea."
4223,"He's gone through hell and back over the last few years getting through the initial diagnosis, medication, etc."
4224,I'll see a thread asking people what medications they're on and a lot of people say they're on antidepressants.
4225,"I'm just so, so pissed off that this happened

I'm also scared of this happening again and throwing off my whole life unexpectedly, I'm scared my new medication won't work, blah blah blah and I feel really, really sad as well 

Sorry if this doesn't make sense but I'm on a lotttt of medication right now."
4226,"tldr; I had a mixed episode, I wound up in the hospital for 4 days, my body is adjusting to new meds, I'm pissed off my regular doctor didn't treat me properly, and I messed up my whole school plan and I'm trying to get back on track after months of absolute hell and just ughhh I don't fucking know right now I'm so confused

tldr; How long to go back to normal after a mixed episode?"
4227,"So now I've got a decision to make:  Do I take his advice and cutback/drop the meds he doesn't like, or do I ignore his advice and find a new psychiatrist (I've already got an appointment scheduled)."
4228,"Well, since taking the medications, I have truly realized how bipolar (II) and psychotic thoughts have clouded my view of the world."
4229,"I am temporarily without insurance and am on a budget, so I have to go about two more months without meds or seeing someone."
4230,"I've been without meds for about four months now, so the ""just coming off meds"" hell isn't really a thing right now."
4231,They wont adjust my meds.
4232,I quit taking my meds last week.
4233,"My partner is bipolar, and we have always known, but she was recently diagnosed (rediagnosed really) after seeking out help and finally getting on meds."
4234,"Therapy is allowing her to finally see why she has been behaving the way she has, and she is coming to terms with her illness and that therapy and meds are a lifelong commitment she has to make to stay stable."
4235,"""But it's ancient Chinese medicine that may be a possible treatment."""
4236,I'm always kind of worried about taking new medicines because I never know what's going to happen or how it will make me feel.
4237,I haven't taken any of the other medicines either because I'm scared of having a bad reaction especially since Abilify has such a long half-life.
4238,"The only reason I'm being suspicious about it being psychosis is that: 1) She is too weak minded to keep a secret about a murder which is completely irrational 2) I have been noticing her behaviour is a bit out of the ordinary recently (heavy drinking, hypersexuality, not taking meds, talking about reality and what it really is, what planet she's from originally, seeing through her minds eye etc...)."
4239,"Im going to be starting meds in about a week, and I just came across a video on one of the other subreddits where some crackpot lady basically started equating taking meds to alcoholics who drink for social anxiety and for some reason it really triggered me in a way that I haven't been in a very long time and I just want to scream FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOU right into her stupid ugly fucking face."
4240,"I just, I can't and won't believe her because if meds won't actually help, that it'll make things worse, that its all a pharmaceutical conspiracy, then I legit don't have any reason to go on because I cannot continue to live like this, I would rather burn myself alive than keep living like this if it were my only 2 options."
4241,"I don't know why I'm posting this, I guess I just want to be told that meds ARE the right thing, that they have helped you guys and that I'm not just going to be handing out money to the pharmacy for no reason only to continue on with this shit that we call life with no improvement, cuz I'd rather just end it now then."
4242,"Please tell me I'm right, that getting help and going on meds is the right thing to do and that it will help."
4243,It took me 6 weeks to get a second appointment with a doctor and change my meds.
4244,"And yet, psychiatrists think the meds they give us are working and they're making good citizens out of us."
4245,"As much as I respect psychiatrists' work and admire their service, I don't think they realize how debilitating, humiliating, and costly these meds are."
4246,"I was diagnosed in 1990, Bipolar II with schizophrenic tendencies and went a spell in my 30s off of my medicine, and I had to get back on."
4247,"This is the first time I have had this issue on my meds, granted the dosages haven't been changed in 10 yrs."
4248,"Have any of you experienced this while on meds, and what did you do to ""fix"" it?"
4249,"I can't continue, he won't hear of medication, and I am genuinely sick of cutting him slack."
4250,I'll admit I'm afraid of adding medication to my life because I don't want to become dependent on it but from what I've read it's pretty essential.
4251,But I will if that's what it takes to get my meds.
4252,"Is there anything I can do, short of checking in to psychiatric inpatient, to get my medications?"
4253,But my parents wouldn't let me take meds.
4254,Now I am moving out in 2 months or less and know that I need medication.
4255,"This is just a goofy post, but jesus CHRIST does anyone else's medicine make them grind their teeth!?"
4256,I have seen numerous posts alluding to coffee and sugary treats being bad to mix with your meds.
4257,"I've been on the ""fuck this shit"" state of mind for the past week, and I forgot to take my medication one morning."
4258,"Maybe it was the strand, maybe it was just me being a weakling, maybe it was the lack of meds, maybe this is completely normal and I'm just not used to smoking, but I'm definitely staying off it for a while."
4259,"So I tried discussing medications with my doctor that wouldn't harm a baby if I had gotten pregnant on accident and somehow we came to adderall and wellbutrin, mind you she never asked if I stopped taking the paxil too which I had."
4260,"I just started sobbing in her office about how I just wanted to feel normal again and she goes ""Well you don't want to take any of the bipolar medications so we'll just have to see if this will do"" 

I started calling around to all the therapist offices and the only ones I could afford said they weren't allowed to see me unless I was taking bipolar medications no exceptions."
4261,she would tell me that she understood why bipolar people got off their meds but she always said that she wouldn't do it.
4262,now that she's hypomanic she wants to go off her meds(lithium 900mg).
4263,I know that if her parents knew they would restrict her movements and keep a closer eye on her but they would make sure that she's taking her medication.
4264,never more than 1 day at a time but still not taking medication everyday.
4265,i don't know if it's the medication that's not working or if it's just not strong enough.
4266,TL;DR: my 18 year old girlfriend is entering a manic episode despite being on what i think was regular on time medication and wants to stop taking her medication.
4267,What can i do to make sure she keeps taking her medication when she's on a manic episode?
4268,and should i resort to informing her parents if she still refuses to take her medication?
4269,"I might be mildly depressed, could just be anxiety or the fact that I'm on meds."
4270,Maybe the meds are working?
4271,"Prior to my diagnosis and being on medication, I was fat but it wasn't anything I couldn't change with eating less and moving more."
4272,"Sadly, with medication the simple solution wasn't so simple as cutting back and moving more didn't make much of a dent."
4273,I am on medication right now and I feel like it's not really helping much.
4274,I wasn't even on medication the first time.
4275,"I just wanted to throw it out there, I got some samples and wanted to see if any of you fellow folks have tried this medication and had any positive or negative reactions."
4276,He says my mood swings affect him severely and he wants me to try medication again.
4277,I do not want to take medication because I don't want that in my child's system.
4278,I finally got medicine that works for me.
4279,It's putting such a strain on our relationship I'm debating trying other medicines just to fix this.
4280,I've been involuntarily off meds since January and I'm losing it.
4281,I just need my meds.
4282,"As for meds, I'm on lithium and .5mg risperdal (not much)."
4283,"I was on Zoloft was I was 16, hated it and went without meds until about 3 years ago."
4284,"So it took many years, many medications, and a couple of hospital stays but I've finally gotten this under control."
4285,"I just want to say to all of you out there still struggling with medication, with side effects, with cycling, I've been there."
4286,"I've had medicine make me a zombie, I've gone through horrible side effects, I've been in three separate psychiatric stays."
4287,"Also just because you're feeling better, don't stop your medication, don't even think about it."
4288,I am no sick of all these meds.
4289,"For me, it is the only way I can relieve my neck/back pain (I am allergic to Percocet and the medication I am currently on hurts my stomach so badly I lost 15 lbs in 2 months)."
4290,Idk if the fact that I'm on my bipolar meds will prevent this.
4291,"I am unsure what happened, but last Friday I wasn't able to call in a refill, the office was closed, and I was out of meds."
4292,"I accepted medication because I thought it would make studying easier, but instead I have simply been stuck in a deep depression ever since I started."
4293,"Even on my meds, I have periods of constant cycling."
4294,Next week I'm going to talk to my Dr. about medication and then I see my psychologist the very next day.
4295,EDIT: I'm not on medication.
4296,"I couldn't keep living on meds though, that's all I know."
4297,"She says she ""can't hear them"" when taking her medication, which is why she won't let a pill pass her lips."
4298,"I know that just straight up telling her ""You need to get back to your therapist and take your meds"" is a HUGE no-no that could trigger an episode, but she's really wearing on me emotionally."
4299,He isn't getting much sleep waking up at all hours of the night to deal with my night terrors as a result of my meds on top of the jet lag.
4300,My case manager said stop the meds but I need them because being in a mixed state without meds is torture.
4301,"Before conceiving, I talked to my doctor and he said there was risk to staying on the meds when pregnant, but he thought it would be better for me if I stayed on them."
4302,I brought it up to my doctor(VA doctor) and asked about medication or anything to help since I have been struggling with college.
4303,"My Dr told me to look for any signs of hypomania to help him figure out the correct diagnosis and meds, but I'm not sure if this qualifies or not."
4304,"I've been researching my symptoms and today I finally told my psych about them, but my problem now is that meds for ADD often conflict pretty heavily with meds for bipolar disorder."
4305,"I guess my question is, is there any hope of me finding meds that can work with each other?"
4306,Everything I research seems to say that ADD cannot really be controlled without meds.
4307,"I'm emotionally abusive... and I really hate to admit that to you guys, but I'm sure you know how it can be without your medication."
4308,"With meditation and medication my mind has calm down a lot, (most of the time), my headaches have reduce a lot, I'm feeling overall better."
4309,His medication is being changes from epilim to some new drug that he is not to fond of because he is having suicidal thoughts.
4310,He went to the hospital and they gave him the new medication .
4311,"My question is, If I start on medication, and mood balancers will it help my ability to do well?"
4312,Aside from medication woes I've found myself getting manic more often.
4313,My hubby self medicated only with pot for 10 years before finding medication.
4314,He finds it helpful as a distraction but now we are not sure smoking helps his mania or depression and we have noticed that it might be causing a less effective result from his medication.
4315,He is moving towards quitting but enjoys the distraction too much as he is often on the meh-depression side after meds.
4316,"Firstly, I have questions about medication."
4317,Background info: I was diagnosed when I was 16 and went on meds for 8 months.
4318,"Hated how numb I felt, ended up moving, stopped taking the meds, and just smoked a bowl whenever I felt like I was losing control (living in the middle of nowhere helped this)."
4319,"I havent acted on any of this, but have decided to go back on meds and start therapy again."
4320,Is it possible that if diagnosed to eventually no longer need the medication?
4321,"I'm just wondering, when I'm off my meds or I'm extremely stressed I often get visual hallucinations (usually spiders) just as I'm lying in bed, or in the evening as I'm getting ready to go to sleep."
4322,i need my meds and the hoops to get them again are retarded.
4323,i dont know many bipolar people who want to go back on their meds.
4324,"The darkness of the night is of no difference than the caverns of the mind that echo provocation from stalamites that pierce into the heart until it bleeds not from courageous battles with spears, but from the cruel apex  of the talons that grow twistedly from the digits of demons that dwell wickedly around the flames of the fires of the soul that is suppressed by the distressed and depressed matter of the brain of the fickle, temperamental, being that longs more than anything to hold itself sacred rather than run rampant and unbridled, on diminished fuel that can only be replenished by the ink of the sword of a shrink, and the stink of the medication for mediation between the thought and the feeling."
4325,Do I just wait it out an hope that I adjust to the meds?
4326,Despite treatment (with both medication and psychotherapy) I haven't had a real job.
4327,"I did not feel a burning, I did however somewhat taste the medication in the back of my mouth very briefly before I awoke in the recovery room."
4328,"I can't stop obsessing over how I could have been happy with her, had I been on the right meds."
4329,I've been stable on my medication for about 6 months (before that things were bad for a while) and regularly see a psychiatrist and therapist.
4330,"I have been extremely understanding with her for a long time but I'm just starting to look at her while she takes multiple medications (lithium 900mg, bc, etc) and see that I am in kind of uncomfortable with my future with someone with her condition."
4331,"Been off meds for a while, preparing to go back on them when BAM, up all night every night, using drugs again, doing stupid impulsive things and absolutely broke."
4332,"She takes medications but I don't know the specifics, but she also occasionally does street drugs which worries me."
4333,So has anyone else had trouble with allergra or other allergy meds?
4334,**TL;DR: My mom has bi-polar disorder and abuses medications and I don't know how to react towards how she acts.
4335,Not taking any meds right now.
4336,Can anyone suggest bipolar meds that do not harm the liver?
4337,"I evidently wasn't on the right medications, and it happened again this January."
4338,or if the new medications I am on will stop this from happening again?
4339,"My doctor keeps changing my meds and I feel worse and worse each time she does, she just won't listen to me."
4340,I was originally on medication until I felt in a position to stop taking the meds about six months ago.
4341,"I was wondering if any one has an experience on these meds, or being bipolar II or anything like that and might be interested in sharing their experience with me?"
4342,"The meds have been great at controlling my symptoms but I'm having a really hard time with my self confidence due to weight gain, especially with the summer and shorts and bikinis coming up."
4343,Has anyone had success losing weight while on medication?
4344,A change in meds?
4345,Atleast I'm hanging on without the meds.
4346,"The worst is, I don't have access to a therapist and meds."
4347,I came off the last anti-depressant/anxiolytic meds (Zoloft - about 4/5 months ago) I was on without the doctors permission and I worry about a possible relation to this manic feeling that I’m currently suffering from.
4348,"Got diagnosed about 2 years ago, went through a few months of finding the medication mix that works for me, managed to hold down a job for a year and have one successful semester of college under my belt, things are starting to look up again."
4349,As a result I really don't know what it looks like to have effective medications.
4350,I just think that the medication is just messing with my head.
4351,Could the medication affect me or is it just me??
4352,He had been on meds but they tore up his body and his liver could not handle the dose.
4353,"He is now on meds and now his eyes stay at a light grey/blue and greenish tones but very blended, i guess."
4354,"My husband thought I was a mind reader, I laughed and told him ""I can ONLY read YOU""

TL/DR My Bipolar Husband's eye color changed with mood before meds."
4355,And I have no meds PRN to deal with the times when I want to scream at everyone and peel all the skin off my body.
4356,"I'm trying to decide if it's a deal-breaker on these meds, it's making me not want to go to bed."
4357,"I first stared taking medication a little over a year ago, but because of the toll that trying to find the right combination of meds took on my life i gave up and completely went off my meds."
4358,"All I  can do is take my medication, follow through with my treatment and hope some miracle will happen."
4359,Was on medication for about 7 years.
4360,"During that time, I had lost my insurance but was able to continue receiving medication through a program."
4361,My meds stopped working.
4362,I couldn't get back on any meds because that program was for those meds specifically.
4363,"My problem is that because I have anxiety stemming from a doctor who refused to take me off of a mood stabilizer that made me suicidal (I voluntarily committed myself to a psych ward in order for me to get my meds changed) and because the Dr office kept double charging me, I stopped going to my Dr."
4364,"My question to you guys is, what medication do you take/recommend and how long did it take to kick in?"
4365,I quit taking my meds yesterday.
4366,But I am not on medication.
4367,I refuse to go on medication.
4368,Basically I think I really fucked my meds up.
4369,I started my meds last March.
4370,But I was also failing to take my meds consistently.
4371,"but I would never think about taking my meds because I woke up feeling great in the morning, and was out the door before I had time to think about it."
4372,"I really thought my meds were working, I felt great!"
4373,"I wasn't even taking my meds....
Now I feel like shit."
4374,I'm back on meds consistently now for the last week.
4375,"^(I am taking meds, getting better, been doing pretty okay."
4376,"Read: insurance, meds paid for [or at least assistance] etc.)"
4377,I was on a cocktail of meds and ended up in a mental hospital for a few weeks.
4378,I don't take any medication for a few reasons.
4379,I don't want to blame it on the lack of medication because I feel like it's a lot more than that.
4380,"I’ve been wishing that I have never said anything to my pain specialist, that I never got “help” aka forced medications."
4381,I want off this medication.
4382,"I have no intention of going on meds as its pretty clear that all my episodes were due to poor eating habits (as it turns up, I have all sorts of food intolerances/ digestive issues), lack of sleep/exercise routine, etc."
4383,"He said my regular doctor, who is not a psychiatrist but is familiar with psychiatric medication, ""seems to have everything under control and is making good choices."""
4384,"And my other doctor, the one he wants me to stay with for treatment now, my family regular physician, well, he thinks with medicine alone I can be treated and completely rehabilitated within three months."
4385,"Lamotrigine has greatly decreased the severity of the depressive episodes, and keeps me functioning when I'm in my hypomanic episode for weeks, sleeping ~3 hours a night ( feel way better without sleep meds )."
4386,"for better or worse, until the medicine starts helping."
4387,I'm traveling from the US to Hong Kong and wonder what the rules are about psych medications.
4388,"As you all know, medication is critical to stability."
4389,I made the stupid decision to stop taking my meds exactly a week ago so that I could do MDMA without risking serotonin syndrome.
4390,A while back I made a post of how I started feeling better because of my medication cocktail.
4391,Now he is stabilized on meds and we don't let him drive due to his short-time memory loss and lack of focus/attention (I would tell him something he would he forget a few minutes later).
4392,Once he refused to take his meds unless we allow him to drive.
4393,I'm in some really challenging courses right now in college and my meds just flat out stopped working.
4394,I felt better literally the next day after adding in the lithium but I'm still anxious about being on THREE medications.
4395,"My deepest, gut desire is to be able to be off of medications but the lithium is so helpful right now."
4396,"I'm also a little sensitive about it because I have some family members who aren't very supportive of medications and think that everything can be solved by ""prayer alone."""
4397,How do you guys balance your concern about side effects and medications with the stability that comes with the medications?
4398,"About a year ago, I... went off my meds."
4399,"After being stabilized for 2 years, I doubted my diagnosis, went off my meds, and I am in doubt no more."
4400,How do I get my meds back stat?
4401,I'm afraid to start my new position because I am not sure what medication I need to be on this summer.
4402,Just trying to figure out if this is a side effect of my medications or if there's something else going on with my sinuses.
4403,I was either put on meds that made it impossible for me to work or that made me feel even worse.
4404,Though the pdoc said I should be on a mood stableizer and a daily antianxiety medication which I should get through a pdoc.
4405,I'm going to talk it over with my husband tonight (though he is still against meds currently but is letting me do what I feel is necessary).
4406,I did hypnosis in the beginning to learn relaxation and I am taking meds.
4407,"&amp;nbsp;

I know I'm not supposed to stop taking my meds without talking to a doc first, and I didn't mean to, it just... kind of happened."
4408,"Well, I never got around to doing that, and now I'm wondering... just as you're not supposed to *stop* taking meds without consulting with a therapist, after being off them for nearly a month, does anyone know if it's safe to just *restart* taking them again without talking to a therapist?"
4409,"But I guess - I just wanted to talk about this somewhere, from people who might have a similar experience with medication."
4410,Then they stopped taking medications and experienced a negative event and went crazy.
4411,"How stupid it is to bank on meds fixing things when I can't take hardly any because of another med I'm on (which I must take and there are no substitutions) and the few I can take, namely lithium, lamictal, and wellbutrin, I've all taken twice for long periods and didn't help."
4412,I'm also on medication and my parents doubt I even have it because my sister has it worst and also I've hid it for so long.
4413,They sent me to sub-accute (long term) and i started cycling through different meds trying to find what was right for me.
4414,It's been since october since i've had my meds due to lots of moving and family situations.
4415,"Taking my meds of course, that I know is important."
4416,Because I asked for advice on how to keep myself grounded while trying to adjust to being off my medicine.
4417,My medicine kept the suicidal thoughts coming on a daily basis.
4418,"When I made my suicide attempts, even succeeding once and being revived, I was on medication."
4419,My Pdoc reccomended the NAC and it has some solid if emerging studies for its effectiveness on bipolar depression- if you aren't having any luck in the downswing and other meds aren't desirable perhaps ask your Pdoc about it.
4420,I can't even get on good medication.
4421,I'm only 19 and everywhere I've gone they stick me on shit meds.
4422,What the fuck is the point of agreeing to go on meds if they won't even give me anything that works.
4423,Two years after my official diagnosis I've finally given into the meds.
4424,I'm in a LTR with an amazing woman who makes sure i take my medications and makes sure i take car of myself.
4425,I thankfully am fairly well balanced and with my meds don't get many depressive moods but my manic states can get a little much.
4426,"I worked hard to maintain balance all day despite feeling like I am losing it, and was relieved to take meds tonight for a reliable night of good sleep."
4427,I don't have bipolar but the medication is the same as a bipolar person would take.
4428,"My doctor has pulled all of my meds, because I am pregnant."
4429,The doctor also took me out of work for the next 2+ weeks because stopping one of my meds causes horrible withdrawals so I won't be able to work anyway.
4430,"How many of you guys, possibly due to the amount of information youve been presented with/read/studied related to your illness and other associated factors, interactions have found yourselves either being hypervigilant of symptoms ('oh god im having cardiac arrest') or you spend far too much time like me, carastrophising all the myriad ways your moods, meds, substances, insomnia, stress and the like could set you up fpr chronic diseases A-Z?"
4431,"No meds yet, if anyone is wonderinkg."
4432,"So not being able to convince him that this medicine worked for me, he gave me Buspar."
4433,"After 3-4 weeks, what I thought was the medicine started making me feel really emotional."
4434,I have schizoaffective (bipolar subtype) and I am currently on a whole mess of meds to keep me mildly stable.
4435,"Went off my meds during pregnancy, and then started them back up after I gave birth almost three months ago."
4436,I was just wondering if bipolar symptoms will sometimes appear even when under the control of medication?
4437,"I've been doing great on my meds, and I'm sticking to them religiously."
4438,I know I am already somewhat down because my medication doesn't totally level me out.
4439,Can certain medications do something to the redness in your eyes?
4440,"When I go to concerts, I don't take my meds with me, and I usually come back pretty late."
4441,It will be maybe three or four hours after the time I take my meds.
4442,Does this have anything to do with my meds?
4443,"I dropped my psychiatrist and went off my meds, it was 50% a bad decision."
4444,"As a result our family was sent to a family psychologist, who referred my mom to a psychiatrist and she is now on proper meds and she truly is a different person now then she was for 20 years of my life."
4445,"?mg Risperidone, 12 mg of Abilify, 72 mg of Concerta, 80 mg of Propranolol, but in the end the medication caused more problems than my diagnosed bipolar disorder, and I cut everything except 200 mg of lamictal."
4446,"My GPA is low because the first year I was a psychotic anarchist who believed in God rather than grades, the second year was better but still not consistent because of me adjusting to my meds."
4447,I'm looking for a new psychiatrist and therapist at the moment because they seem to think my medications are doing me well right now and that these are just small scale symptoms that will never go away even though I have two bipolar I family members one of which has been very stable for some time.
4448,Right my question my wife and I have an absolutely wonderful sex life BUT when mania hit I long for another woman I just cannot get it out of my mind the touch feel smell of another woman almost overwhelms me to date I have managed to keep it to a bit of online flirting but lately I have had to have had to have HRT as well as all my other meds now I am finding it more and more difficult to just leave things at flirting.
4449,I've been on my medication for a while now.
4450,But I can't tell if the reason I feel good is because of the medicine or because I'm dealing with hypomania.
4451,"I have struggled with finding the ""right"" cocktail for a long time, and still struggle with finding meds that work."
4452,I take my meds as prescribed.
4453,My best friend recently went into a treatment center to begin medication for his depression.
4454,Now that he has been released he has become overly aggitated we feel he is having withdrawal symptoms possibly from the plethora of other medications he was on.
4455,We also feel the other medications were masking the adverse effects of the Trileptal.
4456,Any suggestions regarding withdrawals of these medications would be greatly appreciated.
4457,"what meds do you take, how do you like them?"
4458,I'm kind of new to this whole medication thing.
4459,How do you know you need your meds adjusted?
4460,I started on some meds (zyprasidone) and I felt really good for the first couple weeks but I feel like I've gone back to a more depressed/anxious state this last week or two.
4461,"I found it even more difficult, I had no imagination, I'm thinking it was the medication."
4462,"They changed my meds, and it was like night and day."
4463,My meds worked better and better.
4464,"Like the title says, I'm out of money and can't refill my meds."
4465,This will be the first time I haven't been on meds since I was 13.
4466,Do any of you have advice on getting to sleep when your body is used to the sedative effects of meds without being able to take said meds?
4467,So I had my meds upped and overall I see myself doing a lot better.
4468,"I am BPII with OCD and severe GAD, when I was yonger and on medications I was a wreck, barely functional, (and frequently non-functional) and medicated into an existential crisis."
4469,"I became chemically dependent on some medications, and due to the mail effing up I was forced to go multiple days without a medication that made me experience physical withdraw symptoms should I miss a dose by an hour."
4470,"After the meds arrived two days late I never went back on them, because the possibility of experiencing that again was to painful and terrifying to imagine."
4471,"I thought maybe I was the statistical anomaly whose brain re-wires to the meds they took in adolescence, and now that I can feel myself nosediving all of that is shattered."
4472,"I already have a working relationship with a therapist, I just got one, right before I began the decent, I hope so much that I can do this without going back on medications that destroy me, but I am just so afraid."
4473,I've had an allergic reaction to medications before and this isn't the same.
4474,I don't have time to change meds or increase them or anything like that so I need some way of staying on an even keel and produce good quality work for just the next few days.
4475,I'm not using any drugs at all (other than my meds) and I won't say I don't completely hate the feeling of being hungry.
4476,I've been diagnosed before with depression(and prescriped anti depressants but I refused to take my medication) and Anorexia Nervosa.
4477,"I've talked with my therapist, I'm taking my meds (when I upped the dose on my Dr's orders my paranoia went through the roof) but I can't seem to do anything."
4478,"My mother was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder but she refuses to eat her medicine ( mood stabilizer, sleeping, stimulant,  epsilin chrono )."
4479,My family tried to give her medicine but she refuses saying that it is poison.
4480,"Even after mixing it in with her drinks, she still refuses and even spits out the medicine."
4481,"Today, she threw away a week's worth of meds."
4482,"She's been battling this seriously for the last couple of years, and has made some terrific improvements over the last couple months but due to some medication adjustments she's been really struggling the last couple of weeks."
4483,I've been completely off meds since.
4484,"I talked to the doctor about it and explained why I don't use my insurance and how I spend about $300+ a month for psych appointments, therapy, and medication."
4485,"My story is about Jacob, an oil painter with bi-polar disorder, and how he stops taking his medication during a manic phase."
4486,His girlfriend Maggie and his therapist Dr. Everett are able to see what he's going through but he declines their help in order to experience the joy of his art show without medication.
4487,I would like to get back on meds but preferably something not that harsh.
4488,So I've kinda dropped the medication and therapy ball a bit this month.
4489,"I'm on meds and take them religiously, but I still have this fear that I'll push myself over the edge somehow."
4490,"I've tried dozens of different medications, but have never had more than mild success with anything, thus far."
4491,"Side note: I have been on meds, but I stopped taking them a couple months ago."
4492,"He isn't on medication, but he does see a therapist."
4493,I'm a 30f and have been on various bipolar and anxiety meds for going on 5 years now.
4494,About 4 months into taking the lithuim(have tried 2 other meds other than lithium in the past few years with bad results) I havent had a period.
4495,I am wanting to have children eventually and am wondering if anyone else has had the same issue with being on bipolar and anxiety meds stopping their period.
4496,"About a week ago, I slipped up and forgot to take my meds one night."
4497,"But in the meantime, do I quit taking the meds?"
4498,"I'd hate to start from the beginning, titrating back up from nothing, when this medication has been so helpful to me."
4499,"I was wondering if anyone else also has that, if there's hope for me to get better at managing it, effective strategies, what meds you're on, etc."
4500,"I'm worried that everything is out of control, and I'm at the mercy of my moods, my meds, and my spotty mental healthcare."
4501,"I started dating this guy just a week (two months ago) before I got diagnosed, and I just started taking meds at that time."
4502,The medication must be working.
4503,"My psychiatrist keeps tweaking my meds, but the Lamictal just isn't handling the mood swings."
4504,"I just got started on my meds, so they aren't helping much yet."
4505,"Other than the dreams, I am really not having other severe side effects; this has been the only medication that I have been on in years that has practically eliminated the depression."
4506,I'm 23 years old and do not qualify for medication or help because I have no insurance.
4507,"Is remission the relatively calm period between episodes, and they're pursuing medication of acute symptoms?"
4508,"Hey, I'm diagnosed BP2, and started medication and therapy some time ago."
4509,"I might not be bipolar and I'm not seeking for diagnosis from any of you, but if I have to find some way to be better, I need to know and I'm asking for any techniques other than meds to see if I can notice my mood changes or create a way in which they're not so severe."
4510,At first he was going to give me a cream/medicine to help with the pain but decided not to and quickly gave me a script for an antibiotic cream and told me I would be fine.
4511,"For the first time in a year, he didn't adjust or change any of my medications."
4512,"I'm still taking my meds, god only knows how bad off I would be without them."
4513,*(This medication is fucking up my life.
4514,"I'm sometimes bad about taking my medication, but honestly even when I'm consistent for weeks I still feel like sludge."
4515,"Any success stories of people whose lives were changed for the better by medication, or it gave them the strength to change themselves?"
4516,"I tried to comfort her and then she admitted she had some anxiety problems, and sometimes she took medication for that, which I found out way later to be, I think, Xanax."
4517,"So during our relationship, sometimes she'll just start feeling it kicking in, but she doesn't take her medication anymore - says the side effects are too bad."
4518,"Does it bother anyone else that when you start having an episode someone comes along and says ""just take your meds""?"
4519,I am taking my meds and sometimes I have episodes.
4520,"It seems like (exaggeration) everyone decides at some point, to be off of their meds."
4521,I have coping mechanisms now and wonder if that means I could keep a handle on it off meds.
4522,"Being off meds seems to be everyone's preference, and I feel why."
4523,"But, my psychiatrist does not want me off meds."
4524,"So, I listen to her and am still on meds...at the present moment; lithium dizzy, nauseous, shaky and slightly manic (hence, the disorganized post)."
4525,It just seems like I'm the only person 'falling for' being on meds.
4526,"One other important note:  a new medication was added to my cocktail very recently (right when I started feeling all this), but I have looked and it doesn't have any side effects of a decreased sex drive."
4527,The medication is Geoden.
4528,"**  

One other important note is that I also started a new medication right when I lost interest in sex (Geoden)."
4529,and that's on the medication.
4530,"(I have been off medication for a year by the way, and smoke weed every day now (and have for the past year and a half or so) I'm 21 now, engaged to a really great man."
4531,"I haven't been taking medication so I decided last night, to start it again."
4532,I made an appointment with my medicine lady and I'll be getting put on more medication.
4533,Other days I feel like he thinks I'm gross from gaining all kinds of weight from my meds+ birth of our child.
4534,"That resulted in him being in therapy for a year (he quit going), and starting some meds."
4535,"When he was there, they were shocked at the meds he'd been taking."
4536,"So now he's out of the hospital, new meds, and seeing a therapist again."
4537,"He has prescription meds for his condition of which he has been refusing to take claiming ""they make me tired as fuck."
4538,"The third time, my brother saw the early signs and got john to take his meds."
4539,"As much as my psychiatrist and therapist try to tell me the contrary, I can't help but feel that having bipolar disorder makes me always a liability to be dangerous to others and myself, even with meds and counseling."
4540,I've been off meds now for several months.
4541,I can't get back on meds any time soon.
4542,"If I don't, we can't afford pdoc visits every month plus meds."
4543,"And to her credit, her concern with me and a large part of her paper was about the risks of taking medications you don't need if you're misdiagnosed or falsely diagnosed."
4544,"And still, I'm skeptical about the medications I'm taking and how soon my psychiatrist wants to increase my dosage and also I was thinking it was just ""situational"" depression before I saw a psychiatrist."
4545,My other half is coming back and he also told me he is thinking about going back to the city mental health clinic to get back on meds and start therapy again.
4546,I was just diagnosed as bipolar about two years ago (though I'd suffered with it through antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications for twenty years before that) and the symptoms are much improved.
4547,"The problem, however, is that the medications are making me very tired all the time - so much so that I can't stay awake the whole day and am lethargic for much of the time I am awake."
4548,"I've come to the point where I'm even more anti-medication than I was before, just because of issues with medications and the doctors prescribing them."
4549,So I took one with my morning meds before I went to work and ended up having to leave work for a few days.
4550,"This was NOT something I ever had issues with before I went on medication, and I am so afraid that I might be heading towards a psychosis....that scares me more than anything else."
4551,"It scares me that these symptoms didn't show up until I started taking medication, but I still take them like clockwork."
4552,"Anyway, I'm posting here because recently she's been bad about taking her meds and so she's having a little episode."
4553,She's changed medications.
4554,And you can't go to your doc because it's not bad enough to consider adding a fourth medication.
4555,"I took my overweight-from-meds body out in the rain and hail and triumphed over 13.1 miles of beautiful, slippy-slidey mud trails."
4556,"I've been trying to get my meds right for a while so things have been touch and go, but I'm so glad I got out there and tried."
4557,I have been on medication about six weeks now.
4558,I have enough common sense to keep taking my medicines and try to avoid having a bad mood swing but I just miss it.
4559,Glad we have medication out there to help us with this imbalance in out brains.
4560,"I am bipolar II and about a year ago, I had a pretty bad break (delusions, extremely high/manic highs, extremely low/depressed lows) right before I got on meds."
4561,"Then for the next 3 months or so while I was on my meds, I was in a high."
4562,"After 3 months or so of being on my meds, I went back into a sort of middle ground state."
4563,"Okay, you definitely have to get your meds checked—and I’ll just be happy to see his face again, in person—that too."
4564,"So I get out, and a few weeks later I decide to stop taking my meds... and shortly later I went manic again."
4565,I've been through hell but with the right medication I feel like my pre-depression/manic self.
4566,"I'm in a low mood which has been made tolerable with taking my medicine correctly, eating three squares, forcing myself to not sleep all day, and staying away from drinking but when I feel myself sinking all I can think of is that I'm a burden to those I love and constantly complaining."
4567,"I'm currently on 4 medications: Lamotrigine, Latuda, Lunesta, and Lexapro."
4568,I do not like the fact that I have to take medications but I do because if I don't I might get worse.
4569,She initially had to take medications but she does not take any medications now for Bipolar Disorder.
4570,"So my question is, will I always have to be on medication?"
4571,Do any of you have success without medication?
4572,I thought I'd be happy if I got the right meds so I did.
4573,I'm on meds I exercise I don't do drugs or alcohol.
4574,I'd really appreciate it if anyone can share success stories about acheiving long-term stability on the same medications.
4575,"I am certainly not going to be going drinking right upon starting the medication, but I do want to try it out and I would like to hear what you all have to say about this."
4576,My boyfriend will randomly accuse me of not taking my meds when I'm emotional and make other sometimes demeaning comments to me about my illness.
4577,Hi  I have been taking my meds strictly habitually for 7 years now.
4578,Now I was off my meds for a month or so.
4579,I'm really anxious about rocking the boat (side effects of meds) because I'm a senior and I'm going to have a very busy rest of 2014 (4 classes and working PT).
4580,"Although, my mother saw me researching BP and had an awful response (told me to pray more, it's all in my head, meds are bad, it'll go away, etc.)."
4581,"My current meds are
Seroquel XR
Wellbutrin SR
Lexapro
Rozerem
Concerta 
Intuitiv

So blah blah blah, irritability issues sleeping."
4582,I think I'm fine to go but will the TSA freak.with all the meds?
4583,I'm currently emerging from a meds-induced depressive state (fuc-king Ris-per-dal).
4584,"So I'm starting medication soon, doing research, and just found this community."
4585,It was just after this that my sister in law had another breakdown and was admitted to hospital for treatment and she's now on medication.
4586,He says I talk to loud and fast and at him and what not...I am on meds solely because of him... what the hell changed...how do i fix this?
4587,"I would have been in control of my actions and prevented many bad decisions with money, sex, and impulses (granted I was still on adhd meds)."
4588,"I was supposed to go to a psychiatric evaluation tomorrow so that I may be able to start getting on meds, but it's a 7-mile bike ride, I bike often and I could do it, but I'd have to wake up early, I'm too depressed, my bike tires aren't pumped, I need to have it fixed but I have no $ and 1,000 other excuses."
4589,"I want to be on meds, but I just can't bring myself to fight, I am out of fight for the moment."
4590,Finding the right medication is like baking a cake.
4591,I may not have insurance next month and my meds are very expensive.
4592,I was wondering if anyone else has had a major problem gaining weight from their meds?
4593,"I'm still taking my medications as suggested, but I can't shake the feeling I'm about to plummet."
4594,How could I ever look myself in the eyes if I took the amount of medication I need not to feel?
4595,I've been on hundreds of different medicine cocktails in my life.
4596,"I don't have insurance anymore, making my shrink visits and meds very expenxise."
4597,"With everything going on, depression, meds, money, our engagement..."
4598,"So, first, you may want to read [this post I made at r/relationships](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mupsm/30m_my_wife_24f_is_bipolar_and_its_putting_a/)

For those that didn't read the link, a quick summary:
Been together 10 years in a typical rocky relationship, 8 months ago, she suddenly became bipolar, shes been on and off her meds(trying to find the right one), our relationship has been extremely rocky."
4599,"Originally, we agreed I would stay around to see her on her medication and because financially, it made sense."
4600,I just want her on her meds and to be who she once was.
4601,"If she gets on her medication, what are the chances of things working?"
4602,"Also I tend o wet the bed still at times, I blame the meds, and she was totally cool with it."
4603,I am 21 and have recently (past month) been diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder and am on medication.
4604,I have a friend that was pretty recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder while hospitalized (this summer) and has been prescribed meds.
4605,I've tried many different meds throughout the years with some success but still remain very depressed and anxious.
4606,"* **I just got diagnosed with bipolar disorder two weeks ago, started on medication (Depakote), so I'm very excited to start this journey of my life."
4607,"I've been sleeping 11+ hours a day while I'm adjusting to this new medication, and since then I've been far less productive."
4608,I am worried because I am not on medication and even on weeks she I pulls doubles at my original job I become severely depressed and stressed out.
4609,Take my meds?
4610,I think my meds have gluten in them.
4611,"I took my old SSRI and my current one, a lot of caffeine and some cold meds."
4612,"I know I have to be open to going back on meds, but I'm afraid to make that call prematurely because I worked so hard to get here..."
4613,"This is after talking it through with my doctor and discussing the other possible medications, we decided just to slowly lower the dose, see if i can eventually get to 2.5mg."
4614,"Atm, my medication works perfectly."
4615,"He's been on a rollercoaster of meds, and two rounds of ECT (the last maybe 1.5 years ago)."
4616,"My dad told me himself that he thinks they finally found the ""right meds""."
4617,"Flat affect, probably from meds?"
4618,"For about two months, I have been incredibly non-compliant with my medication."
4619,"I've seen my therapist 3-4 times, talked to my parents every day, my dad came up, took extra medications, played a shit load of tetris, but nothing, and I mean nothing, was as useful to working through all of this as this subreddit was."
4620,"This episode has been 3 weeks of hell, and the worst since I've started medication."
4621,"Here are the reasons why: I've deluded myself into believing they mock me for seeking extra treatment (CBT, DBT, medication therapy), they've remained ignorant about my homosexuality, and I've been a complete failure my whole life."
4622,"It could have been nothing, but it ended up having a highly controlled medication on it, and coincidentally, the patient was a doctor."
4623,"Before being diagnosed and going on medications, I was somewhat functional, had friends, and was going out."
4624,"As I mentioned earlier, I've also done mindfulness, medication, and CBT which have all worked to a certain extent."
4625,"Right now, I'm just on medications."
4626,"I'm on meds (lamictal) and have been trying to make routine changes to help me sleep better, but it's generally been unsuccessful."
4627,"high risk behaviors like my drug addictions, sex, physical serious injuries have been a result of impulse, another symptom, and sometimes the self medication can hit that sweet spot of evening you out, but be careful."
4628,"i have to insert this, because i feel like if i was treated for it sooner, the suicide attempts, losing everything from my home to relationships, were influenced by the disorder, so out of desperation to get my meds, i posted some of my story on one of those donation pages."
4629,"i'm humbly asking for anything to put towards my medicine or something to eat, i'm ""residing"" on a friends couch, hitting new rock bottoms everyday, so anything helps."
4630,side question: how many people on here are on the fewest amount of medication you can be on and function just fine?
4631,"my goal for the longest time is to be well functioning on as few meds as i can be, and so far mission accomplished i almost think i never needed half these drugs."
4632,i fight to get my meds working so that i can start the day.
4633,"He hasn't started on medication for it yet, but he is on Intuniv (?)"
4634,"She doesn't like labels but recently she said she's at a loss with medication with me because I've ""tried everything and nothing works"" not true but."
4635,2 days ago I got about 4 hours of sleep but that could've been because of the new medication.
4636,"As I had felt perfectly fine and I had eaten NOTHING remotely questionable (other than the bupropion), it seemed probable it was a side effect, and I wanted to make sure things were ok.

Ok, now, here is the important part: He told me that the medication would **not** have caused the symptoms, and I had what was a simple case of gastroenteritis."
4637,I've tried every medication and nothing seems to help.
4638,But even with the meds I'm on it's too much.
4639,Has anyone been put on any meds that have helped curb the depression/anxiety but did not dampen their positive-productive-effects of being bp?
4640,I've been struggling with medicine for two years.
4641,About 8 months ago I switched doctors and medicine.
4642,Now I'm back where I started and I'm tired of fixing the medicine and being disappointed later.
4643,"We talked about triggers and psychosis (what we saw, heard, or smelled), medications, different types of therapy."
4644,"(I'm almost out of medication, and it's only for anxiety; no insurance, very little money, trouble keeping anything more than a part time job)"
4645,I take lithium and my other meds give me dry mouth so I'm up several times a night to pee.
4646,"I really want to do mushrooms again (such a soaring, spiritual experience for me) but I don't know if my medications with interact with the psilocybin."
4647,He told me he won't change my meds because antidepressants make me manic.
4648,Is this what I was feeling when I wasn't on my medication?
4649,"This can be my heat tolerance issue with my current dose of Seroquel (50mg), weight gain from said Seroquel, questions about other medications reacting with Seroquel."
4650,"Some things that the supervisor said:

* 1 - Regarding my questions about certain medications interacting with my psyche medications, my pdoc does not have time to answer my questions."
4651,"* 5 - Doctor's don't answer questions about the medication, or concerns."
4652,"* 8 - And finally, if I have been taking my medication regularly."
4653,Should I leave this clinic because I have enough medication?
4654,"BUT

Without health insurance, my medications cost me approximately another $200/month."
4655,"This is not accounting for my other medication, such as birth control pills and inhalers for my asthma."
4656,What meds helped you best?
4657,I was just prescribed ziprasidone for bipolar disorder and was wondering if any of you have had experience with the medication that you could share.
4658,"When I'm on meds it does not help me control my mania, and I don't feel like myself... on one med I had an allergic reaction and had to go to the hospital."
4659,"I have a strong Chemistry background, and I've tried to explain that your body chemistry constantly changes, so my medication doesn't always have exactly the same effect."
4660,Most people who know about my condition still don't seem to understand exactly why I can still have 'mood swings' and mild manic episodes if I'm taking medication regularly.
4661,"Granted, at least my closest friends understand that I know what help I need in terms of medication and counseling and that I do seek that help as needed."
4662,The ex of 4 years left 8 months after I started medication.
4663,"Since the dosage of my meds was increased, I have been doing a little better, but I had an incident today while driving and I feel horrible."
4664,She was on medication about 3 months ago for about a year or two.
4665,Now I know all meds can cause reactions in sun and I've know that for awhile.
4666,My psych said it's sun toxicity due to the meds and I need to just not go outside much during the day.
4667,She has been trying out different meds but doesn't stick with anything for very long.
4668,She's very into natural health through diet and exercise and is struggling with the need for meds.
4669,"She's trying to take minimal meds, won't see a therapist, enjoying the hell out of her mania and then we all spend weeks worrying she's going to kill herself when she crashes."
4670,"I just am upset that I'm taking a medication for depression and yet every time I take the (Savior Pill), it only seems to bring me down to the lowest possible level I ever get to."
4671,My psychiatrist didn't want to prescribe me anxiety medication.
4672,When I asked about anxiety medication she just kind of cut me off and said she didn't want to dope me up too much.
4673,Does this sound like meds?
4674,"I've been told I'm either bipolar or have borderline personality traits but I have to wait for a consultant to give a definite verdict, apparently my meds will either be switched to an SSRI or an anti-psychotic - I'm just wondering how the anti-psychotics work in regards to my situation because I don't actually have and have never experienced psychosis so how do they work as a mood stabiliser?"
4675,"I've been back on my meds since then and I feel useless being unemployed, but finding a job that I feel like I can handle is difficult."
4676,I wasn't on medication at that point.
4677,"I felt that the meds would change who I was dramatically, that I'd be giving up what I am, because bipolar is and was a very big part of who I am."
4678,I was right to be afraid of the meds.
4679,Both of them have told him on more than one occasion that the meds he takes are anti-psychotic (no shit) and he doesn't need to be on them.
4680,They have gone after me as well as I've been taking heavy pain meds for along time for back issues.
4681,Fast forward to October and I attempt to reduce my meds.
4682,"When we're feeling okay, and things are going well, we want to quit our meds because of their side effects."
4683,"As a result, I had to couchsurf a little, and didn't remember to bring my meds with me all the time."
4684,"In the morning after taking my meds, I thought it was just a nightmare, but I checked my phone and found those texts."
4685,I'm NOT an angry person at all (or I was brought up to display very little anger outwardly) but on these medicines I was just flipping out.
4686,"I don't know what to think; on one hand, if I do have some disorder, there is an option for treatment and things can get better for me (when done properly, of course; medications that aren't right for me will be awful, which is what happened to my mother.)"
4687,"The past two years have been a huge journey of acceptance, proper medication, recovery, and stability and then POOF, this wonderful dream girl shows up in my life!"
4688,"The first week of taking it actually lifted me out of a 6 month depression, I thought I'd finally found the right medication for me."
4689,Since then I have been rapidly cycling and having mixed episodes and I was diagnosed with Bipolar but chose to try out some natural supplements before I tried any medication.
4690,I can't speak to her about anything without her saying you just need to start your medication.
4691,"(I couldn't get refills for Ritalin or Ativan, at least until I'm stable on meds again because of the risk of Ritalin inducing a manic episode, I guess) But I just don't know what to do in the mean time!"
4692,I hate taking medications.
4693,.....tl;dr mixed episodes and no meds might be driving me beyond mad.
4694,"I try to explain it to people, and heaven knows the damn doctors don't do anything, I have been on so many meds and combinations that even looking at the pill bottle on my counter makes me feel helpless."
4695,"I ended up in a hospital, new medicine makes me want to be more creative, which keeps me going, but still feel off my feet."
4696,I haven't been on medication for most of this time.
4697,I have been in therapy for almost a month now through my university and I'm finally on medication (lamictal and klonopin.)
4698,"I'm thankful for meds and that they help me lead a steady life, but sometimes I feel like I'm hiding who I really am."
4699,"I'm not considering going off my meds, but I do wonder if this is really me."
4700,"If I miss a day of meds I can tell, I get irritated and super sensitive."
4701,My boyfriend knows he's bipolar but he says he's only mildly bipolar so he doesn't need to take any medication and he doesn't want to spend the time/money to talk to a therapist.
4702,"I don't think he necessarily needs to take meds, but I think it'd help to at least talk to a professional."
4703,"It really pisses me off when someone who is not even taking their medicine tries to tell me to do with my medicine, oh yes she had the gal to tell me to change my medicine!"
4704,Its not my meds it's my god damn endocrine system and she knows it.
4705,I also fell off taking my prescription meds (Lamictal and Wellbutrin) in lieu of these kinds of things.
4706,"He never told me I was bipolar, he just put me on meds for bipolar depression."
4707,I got on the medication after having really bad side effects from Latuda.
4708,"Because of such terrible side effects in the past, I am really starting to be wary of all medications."
4709,"I know a lot about Bipolar, medications, routines, symptoms of episodes to watch out for."
4710,"After starting meds and sort of giving therapy a chance and then going off meds for a week, I've decided that if I really want to make improvements, then I need to try everything my therapist and psychiatrist recommends."
4711,"I'm taking my meds properly, have given up caffeine and even eating mostly vegetarian, going to really try talking in therapy, and tracking my moods."
4712,"My mom says I might be getting them because of my medication (I take lexapro, limictal, serequal XR, and welbutrin)

Also, for the past few months I've developed a BAD habit of sniffing constantly with no running nose."
4713,Do you think it's related to the medication?
4714,"I'm going back to bizarre habits like being afraid of the dark, not coping at night time, I've had to increase my medication (only on seroquel at the moment, which seems to be working well overall), being frightened of small noises, odd sleeping patterns, thinking unpleasant thoughts (like what if my family has been hurt?"
4715,"And yep, I've seen my doctor and he says I'm doing really well and to keep on the current meds and dosage, so I guess thats okay."
4716,First time with meds.
4717,"Regarding medication and effects of combining this with my current meds, I will discuss with my therapist/doctor and read up on before combining."
4718,First option: Restart the stopped meds at a dose that will help knock down anything that may be starting up.
4719,I've been off meds for 6 months doing relatively fine but I am afraid that's coming to an end.
4720,It was nowhere as traumatic as the previous December when I was a complete wreck and almost took all my medicine and had to do an inpatient stay for a week.
4721,I have goals in life and know where I want to go...I want to get into medicine which is one of my passions and I find it rewarding.
4722,"... Don't use mascara or your tears will stain your face ...
My kid is safe with my mom
Make sure to eat
Took my meds
Drink water 
Fish oil, whole food vitamins
Okay."
4723,This care-free stupor was punctuated by brief hysterical lows in which I would feel intense suicidal feelings - worse even than those before I had been taking medication.
4724,While in this state I would do things such as plan ways to kill myself (and come very close to going through with them on occasion); cry hysterically in front of family members; or take cocktails of prescription medications in high doses which I took from my stepdad's medicine cabinet.
4725,My mother asked me if she needed to call his doctor back today and immediately get him on one of the suggested medicines (Seroquel or Abilify) but I told her that I didn't know.
4726,Now I find it hard to get into this mode primarily due to my meds I'm assuming.
4727,"At this point, it should be brought up that I have a problem with alcohol, I don’t know if I will bring it up to the doc the first time, maybe I can just stop and hope the meds give me some peace and I won’t want to drink anymore."
4728,"For those who had suicidal thoughts because of a medicine, how long did it take for you to notice them?"
4729,"The meds were making me sick so i tried to taper to just Lithium, but it's not suppressing my manic states."
4730,"Looking back on when I was on olanzapine, valproic acid and venlafaxine, I realize that these thoughts kinda went away, but the medication is unacceptable to me since they cloud my mind and kill my motivation to do anything."
4731,I always have my wallet on me with my address listed and my girlfriend is fully aware of my medication.
4732,I am feeling kind of helpless at this point because I don't know what to do about my therapist and about the medication (my general doctor prescribed it).
4733,I know I need to call and tell him what is happening but I get the feeling he will tell me that things will calm down once I get used to the meds.
4734,I've tried most of the sleeping meds and they don't work.
4735,"Lately, even with meds, I have been having a very tough time."
4736,"Because of the meds, my mood was stable."
4737,But now I'm starting to think I'm one of those people that meds do not help.
4738,"Since I finally had something in my life that I was determined not to lose (people don't always stick around that long), I decided t give meds a try again."
4739,But these medications are making everything so much worse.
4740,"I guess my question is, should I stay on medication?"
4741,* But my doctor just hands me this new type of chemo medication called Risperidal.
4742,Its like it cancels out all my medications and I'm super hyper and paranoid.
4743,"And, public service announcement: 

Stevens-Johnson's Syndrome is extremely rare but can be a side-effect of a whole bunch of different medications, including but not limited to: 

* Advil and Aleve

* Penicillin and other antibiotics

* Anti-convulsants (We tend to be on these for their secondary mood-stabilizing effects) 

This condition can be deadly, but knowing your early warning signs can save your life."
4744,I'm still trying meds so I work from home a lot.
4745,Even without the hormones I've decided to continue taking my medication (lamotrigine) since I know that it's risky to go off it if I really am bipolar.
4746,MAYBE the meds will kick in and I can live my fucking life.
4747,My question is about my medication.
4748,Has anyone else been prescribed these two meds?
4749,"I am not happy yet, since I have to deal with nasty drowsiness as a side effect from the medication."
4750,will I still get nasty mood swings at times even with the medication?
4751,"Before I thought I was a mild case, now I see why my doctor was so ready to give me some medicine."
4752,"Seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist, taking meds etc, all good for me but I just feel too much of a nutter for most girls."
4753,Once I started getting regular sleep I felt normal and I just don't want to take meds from what I believe was a one time hypomanic state.
4754,I also thought that it was the meds that were making me feel slow/dull.
4755,"I just can't find the will to find a psychologist, go there multiple times a month, &amp; doing trial &amp; error to find meds that work."
4756,Or is this not medication related?
4757,"I've never been a morning person, maybe it's because the medicine I take has ran it's course, my stomach is empty, and overall my body is just in a state of shock or something."
4758,I've gone through hundreds of hours of therapy over the last year and been on more medications than I care to remember.
4759,It's probably my meds so there's not a lot I can do until they stabilize (they just changed yet again 2 weeks ago).
4760,Has anyone attempted successfully therapy or support groups for their disorder without medication?
4761,"Most of my own episodes have all been pleasant in the extreme, no spending of money, sex, etc etc, but all my family/friends find my behavior extremely disturbing and I've always agreed to seek professional help and be put on medications."
4762,"I've been trying new meds and changing doses around for the last 8 months, and my pdoc just doesn't know what to do any more(I was texting her about it last night)

This stuff seems like dissociation to me, and my pdoc thinks that may be what's happening too."
4763,Instead we had a really amazing conversation about people are so closed minded these days about mental illness and medication and all that.
4764,"My boyfriend is not on medication, though he took abilify for a few weeks in I think Sept. 2012 and stopped after a few weeks cause he felt sedated, and he has not tried anything since."
4765,His therapist has told him she is surprised how well he manages himself without medication.
4766,"After many, many medications, and many bad experiences with counselors, psychiatrists, and psychologists, i finally found helpfull medication."
4767,Is this normal on medication?
4768,Is it a possibility that my meds quit being effective or i have built up a tolerance?
4769,I'm not sure what a diagnosis would even do since meds really screw with me.
4770,I had become very stiff and shakey and the medicine seemed to be doing little to help.
4771,"I went to a new psychiatrist to get a second opinion (perhaps, I thought, maybe I'm not bipolar) He listened to my stories and went through my medical records and deduced that I was, in fact, bipolar and that I needed new medication (I had apparently developed akathisia and stiffness)."
4772,My family researched the medications and are scared (as am I) of the side effects.
4773,"I need advice, possible other medications and even just comfort."
4774,I'm on the same medication I've been on since October (50 mg zoloft/day).
4775,"I think she's also self-medicating, lowering her medication I mean."
4776,Trying to go a route that wouldn't lead me to medication I started seeing a therapist to hopefully learn some coping mechanisms and talk through what I was feeling and how it affected me.
4777,"I'm not able to cope without the medicine, but don't want to be on meds forever."
4778,"Since then, I spent 1 year on heavy medications in a zombie state, the next year losing all the weight (75 lbs) I had gained, and then was hospitalized again at the end of that year."
4779,"The weight came back, as did the zombie medications."
4780,The underwater feeling of the medication plus the general chaos that is recovery makes for muddled thinking and a poor grasp of the past.
4781,"So, I am one of those people who are die hard pro-medication."
4782,"I was talking to everyone about how I had finally found a medication that was working for me, until all of a sudden I just stopped taking it one day and I don't even remember why?"
4783,It has now been 2 months since taking my medication and I am back to being a raging psychotic bitch to the point where my mom threatened to kick me out of the house last night.
4784,"She told me ""Since you stopped taking your medication and you are intolerable"" 
I know i am intolerable....but i just don't want to be tired."
4785,"Anyway, once she was revived and spent a few days in the hospital she was released and still wasn't on the proper medications."
4786,Eventually an opening came up with a great dr and put her on a bunch of medication.
4787,"He has been prescribed meds, but I think he's inconsistent in taking them because he says they make him feel like a zombie."
4788,"I have only been on the new meds since Tuesday, I can see a little bit of a difference in taking the as needed meds for the anxiety."
4789,I was on meds put I was a zombie.
4790,"After the hospital, I was on a cocktail of 7 different anti-depressant/anxiety meds."
4791,From what I understand some form or psy therapy should be used in conjunction with meds.
4792,The meds decrease the amplitude of my cycle but I still cycle and I'm white-knuckling it as I wax and wane.
4793,I keep forgetting to take my meds.
4794,Doing very well with CBT and medication.
4795,"Unmedicated ADHD (because I refuse to take meds for it since I've gotten this far without them)

My mind feels numb, like pins and needles, my speech is slurry and someone asked me if I was drunk at work, I'm talking but it's like I am not understanding or comprehending what I am saying, it's like I'm trying to talk, I can physically do it but my mind is on mute - my head feels heavy like concrete."

4813,I've never been on any sort of medication before and the thought of seeking long term help scares the living hell out of me!
4814,I'm in the medication tweaking stage I guess.
4815,This makes sense as to why antidepressants never worked; it was the wrong kind of medicine.

4824,"She's told me that she doesn't like taking her medication, and doesn't see how they will help her out."
4825,"I know that I won't be able to understand where she's coming from, but are there a couple tips that you guys can give me on how to convince her that taking her medication will take time and will be beneficial, how to better deal with one of her episodes in the future, and how to support her as best as I can."
4826,He has seen a doctor who agrees that he is exhibiting most of the symptoms but this is a lifetime diagnosis and that before he would suggest medication that we would need to be positive that this is what we want.

4838,It's been a month of no medication or therapy for me.
4839,"In order to prescribe certain meds they think will help you, they need to add in another DX so insurance companies will pay for it."

How would one go about enrolling in one of these studies?"

since that was a short term program, they referred me to a new psychiatrist who has been adding medication like its candy."
4859,i then went to see her on thursday and told her i want to get off both medications and start with fresh ones since i don't think those were doing me much good.
4860,she made me feel really uneasy about the klonopin so i don't even want to try that one but i don't want to take so much medication either.

4887,"The nurses referred to him a ""non-compliant"" patient because he doesn't want meds, at all."
4888,"I know there is no magic word to have him take meds and stabilize himself, but I really don't want bad things to happen later on down the line because of it."
4889,If so who has had success keeping mania at bay who had previously had medication induced mania?
4890,I fell asleep without taking my meds.
4891,"Here's the thing, and I'm sorry it took me so long, *I don't think I need the medication anymore* but I know how awful it feels to relapse."

4895,"I'm not currently on medication and I still do have my swings, but I'm curious if anybody on /r/bipolar has had a similar experience?"
4896,I mean I know I cant drink now because of medication but what other long term things do you have to go through because of bipolar?
4897,"So before the details here is my basic concern, I have been off medication for a year and a half now after taking it on and off for 2 (mostly depakote and abilify)."
4898,The whole reason for me being off meds is because I felt like I was wrongly diagnosed Bipolar I and I am just checking in now to see if I should stay the course or reconsider.
4899,"**And the story:**

I was basically started on medication immediately after hospitalization for having a very psychotic reaction to smoking weed."
4900,I advised my family and my psychiatrist I was quitting the medication because it is not helping and ever since I've been feeling better and better since getting off it.
4901,"Often better than I had been even before starting the medication...

One reason I was very willing to quit the medication was since the only two episodes which the doctor's could account for were drug related, specifically weed."
4902,"From my perspective the Bipolar I seemed very easily misdiagnosed due to that common variable, and I did not want to be feeling like crap for so long on medication to manage an illness that I did not actually have."
4903,With this year and a half of being off medication I have smoked weed on occasion  and while sometimes anxious for the most part I do not have any problems at all anymore.
4904,"**Now in more recent months...**

I have not seen a doctor since December of 2010 when I quit the medication and have been doing great."
4905,I will not start medication again unless I am certain it will benefit me in the end.

4907,"When I started taking medication to treath depression at the beginning of november, I got a HUGE boost within days."
4908,"I thought the meds were working perfectly for me, even though I bought for hundreds of dollars worth of books in just a month."
4909,I had an Intake appointment with them on Monday and the case worker from there is going to help me get to the med disposal facility on Thursday to reduce the stockpile I have of overdose-able meds.
4910,"In the mean time I have no access to a psychiatrist, I'm still cycling like mad, I'm irritable, angry, and overwhelmed constantly, my meds still haven't kicked in and my wife doesn't want me to go back to the hospital...."
4911,She also questioned my meds because Seroquel is not a mood stabilizer.
4912,I am now at a much more stable place after finding a combination of medications that greatly improve my symptoms.
4913,I eat breakfast and dinner in order to absorb my medication.
4914,I haven't been on meds in months and I really needed help.
4915,"[Macklemore- Otherside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru-LgSvOCrE)

I am off my medication and have been for months."
4916,EDIT: Psychiatrist changed my meds after I rose this concern with him.
4917,"Said he put me on Epilim initially to see how I reacted to low dose medication, and am starting Lamictal tonight."
4918,"So, anyways, as much as this medication is helping, it's (somewhat ironically) reaffirming my lack of belief in free will, which is, in turn, making me feel worse."
4919,"for quick background purposes: I'm bipolar type 2--have had major depressive states and minor hypo-manic states, though I also do rapid cycle

for the past several years I've been pretty stable because of meds, though I have had some problems."
4920,"One level was 13 when it should be between 40-60..... No idea the second blood panel, they are behind on reading results....

Anyways, is this normal for antipsychotic meds?"
4921,"When home I knew I needed medication again, I had taken it for a while but stopped in college."
4922,He has been wanting to do this once I was more stable on my meds.
4923,I am sticking to vyvanse and may go back on my old anxiety medicine.
4924,I'm refusing to take my medication now because I'm in so much pain.
4925,So I've read some threads where people list their meds and I am absolutely shocked at how many people with *Bipolar* are on Adderall?
4926,"I SWEAR I'm better off my meds, but according to my husband I'm more depressed and grumpy."
4927,"With meds, he says, I'm slightly more manic and emotional and he prefers me that way."
4928,So I stay on meds.
4929,"She doesn't take medication and I think the only type she was on was lithium, which she complained made her feel dead inside."
4930,I refused medication because I've been feeling like this since 14 and hiding it well.
4931,I don't want to rely on medication and can't really afford it anyways.
4932,I went off my meds and my family and all my peer group said I was acting strangely and must go back into a psychward to get help.
4933,But even this whole hunt for the right meds is tiring.
4934,"sequel XR

Clonazepam 

It was my first time seeing a psychiatrist yesterday and despite taking all my medication, i'm having a huge low."
4935,"The meds are definitely cushioning the drop, but I'm unsure if this is just a slow drop to feeling very low, like I did before my regimen."
4936,"So I didn't take my medication this morning, telling myself 'fuckit.'"
4937,My ex-girlfriend told me that it would be silly to think that people in the positions that I admire don't take meds for things.
4938,I've been off meds for about eight years.
4939,Will it be long before he decides I need medication?
4940,She's on meds and i'm pretty sure that all of the vast changes and distrust for humans(animals are her life) have triggered her depression and such...
4941,I take preventive meds but they aren't working - obviously.
4942,I've been suffering from depression since the age of 13 (diagnosed around 14-15) and was given medication.
4943,"Up until the age of 20, I've probably visited the doctor once or twice a year for depression and tried different medications at different doses."
4944,On the forms I fill out it asks about current medications I'm taking and if I have any sort of diagnosis and I'm a little apprehensive about answering these questions.
4945,I am on a great combination of medicine that levels my mood.
4946,"A dear friend, trying to help, told me ""The medicine didn't make you gain weight, your eating did.""...Right."
4947,The damn medicine made me constantly hungry where no food could satisfy it and if I didn't eat when I was hungry I'd be sick.
4948,I want to will this medicine to work.
4949,He didn't understand how shitty that medicine made me feel.
4950,"Just the other day I realized that the week before last, I had my meds increased."
4951,Cause I have been on both meds for about two years.
4952,A little over two months ago I went off all the meds I was on.
4953,"I haven't seen a psychiatrist in years and had just been having my gp perscribe me the same meds i've been on with some slight adjustments, but I no longer even live in the same city as him anymore and didn't feel it was safe to continue doing that."
4954,Have you ever lied to your doctor about your meds?
4955,Before I was on meds I usually clawed my hairline when I got this awful feeling of being forced into a body too small for my soul.
4956,"One of my medications is Wellbutrin 300 XL, though I get a generic for it."
4957,She said she'd never been psychotic so wasn't on any meds.
4958,It's been a good 8 months of no meds but recently I've been feeling like a manic episode is coming up.
4959,"I'll be going back to the docs this week to discuss meds but in the meantime I was wondering what others did to keep themselves ""normal""."
4960,"i've been hospitalized multiple times and have hated it every time, but always felt better after a couple weeks of meds, bland food, silly crafts and people to talk to that don't judge (most of the time...)  the only problem is i can't afford to not work for a week or two...  i work a full time job at terrible pay and no paid sick time and have a very long expensive commute everyday, but i have a huge child support amount to pay every week and the government doesn't care if i'm in the hospital and not getting paid, i also do freelance work and have clients relying on me to get things done...  now is not the time, actually its never the time."
4961,"i know the fact that i'm even thinking about it means i should go, but the financial fallout is so great that i'm afraid i'll never recover which will only add to my stress and make my life even shittier than it already is...  i do feel safe there, the meds make the never ending mix tape of suicidal thoughts stop, and i don't have to face the fucked up reality that is my life...  but once my stay is over it all goes back to hell...  but the pull of the hospital blanket draped around me, the little cups of happy pills and being with people that understand what it's like to have a brain that is at constant war with itself is cathartic...  no sharp objects to mutilate myself with (it seems to let some of the poisonous thoughts escape), no bottles of pills saying 'eat me - i can make the pain stop for good', no bridges to jump off, someone concerned enough to check my arms for new cuts every day, no vodka to drown my sorrows in, no illegal drugs to escape into... something about waving the white flag of defeat against this awful thing called bi-polar that makes it stop for a little bit...  like a holy day ceasefire... but just like a ceasefire - the war always starts back up with a vengence...   or am i just being overly dramatic?"
4962,Has medication made a big difference?
4963,It doesnt help that I started new meds either.
4964,"This is my third stay in five years...I'm very frustrated with my condition and I must admit I havent been very proactive,meds after some time will not work."
4965,The systems in place that direct me to strangers that are fleeting in my life and never get to know all of me and fail to adjust any medication properly.
4966,"Im articulate,clean cut,drug free: when im on my meds,im slick and alert....for a while at least..sometimes depression kicks in or mania...i quit taking meds or dealing with this bullshit industry and I seperate myself from it."
4967,"I just want to get a job again and keep fighting but i need my correct fucking meds to do that

Thanks for letting me rant

edit:sorry for grammar and spelling"
4968,I finally drug myself to the doctor to ask that she change my meds cause they're not working.
4969,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder following a horrible run with SSRI medications because a nurse practitioner for my neurologist decided to diagnose me with depression and took it upon herself with no neuro consult and no surveying psychological disorders, prescribe first Lexapro, then Citalipram."
4970,NO INSTRUCTIONS on how to take this medicine were given except 30mg at bedtime for sleep.
4971,I wait 2 months paying $30 a scrpt (as well as MS meds..meds are not cheap) and still nothing.
4972,"This blows my mind because psychologists are Phd and cannot prescribe medicine whereas psychiatrists are MD and can prescribe medication; yet, the psychiatrist never even weighed me nor took vitals and the psychologist conducted a slew of tests to determine the cause, severity and type of bipolar I had."
4973,"I was very encouraged, he wanted to work with my neurologist and make sure that the medicine would also help me with my MS."
4974,This is a great medicine for me but it doesn't go the distance because I'm still pretty scattered.
4975,I actually had a visit with him and we discussed my psychiatry appointment and my disappointment in the new corse of medicine that this nurse practitioner who just met me decided that I needed to take.
4976,"I don't need doctors, nurse practitioners or counselors playing with my brain chemistry without really knowing what is going, how to treat it or how to prescribe certain medicines, and causing me what is certainly more harm than good."
4977,Bad medicine.
4978,Could it be a side effect of meds?
4979,I'm going back soon for a full assessment and diagnosis and to get meds.
4980,"I'm petrified of what will happen to me, what will the meds do to me, will it get better, I am in desperate need of advice."
4981,"To help us remember when to take our meds, I've found both I phone and android apps."
4982,"Share your successful/ not so successful history for taking your meds with your dr/ psych so they can best help you.. 
Hope these help !"
4983,"A doctor prescribed him Paxil once after a pretty severe panic episode, but after a few months he said he didn't feel any difference from the medication and after he tapered off he felt the same too."
4984,After some conversation the psychiatrist listed off five medications and told my friend to pick one.
4985,Maybe even other medications.
4986,"**TLDR:** Friend has impulsive tendencies, far from depressed, went to a psychiatrist and the doctor let him pick medicine off a list, friend picked Lithium on the spot (because the other drugs sounded ""too scientific-y and Lithium sounded familiar -  he didn't do any homework into it or anything), now people close to him (including myself) are telling him that Lithium is overkill and he doesn't need it."
4987,"The one time I couldn't afford to pay for my medication, my mom paid for it."
4988,"My medications aren't helping me at this point, not with all the stress."
4989,I am already on meds.
4990,I was monitored every two weeks until I crashed one day and then we changed meds to valproic acid.
4991,"Then, I came here and I was running out of meds and went through the system with the school insurance."
4992,"Filed prescriptions, got the meds."
4993,I've been on reduced meds for a few weeks now.
4994,"Since she's incompetent, but free, I was wondering what kind of medications work for mixed episodes or rapid cycling (I'm not really sure which I may have)?"
4995,But I wasn't sure if that would be the best medication for my symptoms.
4996,"It's bad to the point where I have to have surgery, so consequently my ENT doctor gave me some different meds to help keep it at bay."
4997,One of those meds was prednisolone (Medrol).
4998,"Finally, I decided to read up about the side effects of the meds that I was taking and, lo and behold, I find some mention of prednisone triggering mania, sometimes even in people who don't have bipolar disorder."
4999,"My doctor didn't mention it to me when she prescribed me the medicine, but in her defense, I'm not sure she is fully aware of my psych history."
5000,"By the time I figured it out, I was done with the course of meds and it resolved itself within a few days, but it was scary."
5001,"I don't know if it would have made a difference or not, but I feel like it might have all gone down differently if I had had an idea that it could happen because of the meds."
5002,"We have two wonderful children, and our family been through many, many hospitalizations and many more medication changes."
5003,At that stage between diagnosis and finding the correct medication plan- while you're still figuring it all out and still figuring out who to tell and how to tell them- What do you wish you would have known?
5004,"It's kind of shitty, I'm in a position where I've moved back home and I've (for the past 7 months) been on some great meds (Lamotrigine) and feel stable."
5005,"Thus doing so, I ran out of my medicine and upon going back, my psychiatrist is re starting my lamictal back at 25mg down from 200."
5006,It just sucks that missing 4 days of medicine puts me back to square one.
5007,He told me that I blamed everything on my bipolar and that I'm too dependent on medication.
5008,He said there are thousands of people that have bipolar and they do just fine without meds.
5009,Because he has bipolar he now gets to see what a pain in the ass it is to find the right doctor and get on the right meds on top of dealing with BP.
5010,"Granted, they have to change up my meds again but whatever."
5011,I've been working hard at taking my meds every day and doing well.
5012,"That mom was concerned not only about my physical health but that I couldn't handle added stress (I have horrible anxiety and have been in the er once or twice to get medicines to help calm my panic attacks down), or that last night a whole bunch of realizations came to my mind and I broke down crying and couldn't even hold a conversation because I was zoning....

March is already a stressful month."
5013,All of them always on and off medicine because they usually convince themselves they don't need it after they're on it.
5014,Does your medication help (it helped my mother when she was on it)?
5015,"The psy thinks I may have a somewhat form of bipolarity (sorry if that's not a proper word, second language here) and suggested medication."
5016,"No pressing matters, right now she just wants me to take a blood test to check on a couple of things and she said we will be talking again about meds."
5017,I'm afraid of meds because I'm afraid to change.
5018,"And I'm also scared as hell because, again to my non-rational-brain, this kind of meds look a lot like drugs."
5019,"Requiem from a Dream is nightmare fuel for me, and the sole idea of taking meds as a regular part of life stresses me out."
5020,One month of one (of three) psych meds I take.
5021,"If I don't take my meds, I get delusional and violent."
5022,I don't even feel sad because of my medication so I'm stuck in this haze of nothingness where there is no reality.
5023,Lately I've been much more depressed than ever because of all of my pain medications.
5024,"I've talked to my doctor about the medication, but we are still trying to figure out what works, and meanwhile my sexual drive is at an all time low."
5025,No more medication.
5026,I do know that my life has become much worse since I got diagnosed and started taking medication (two years ago).
5027,"If I do go off my medication, should I slowly cut back on the lithium or is it fine to just stop taking it altogether?"
5028,I recently had an unpleasant conversation with a very unpleasant person on /r/loseit about meds and weight gain.
5029,"Their claim was that meds cannot make anyone gain weight, they're just used as an excuse for someone who can't stop eating (paraphrasing)."
5030,I saw him and he just told me the lithium should continue improving mood but he doesn't want to change any meds and see if the lithium will help.
5031,I've tried various medications but have given up entirely on their ability to help me.
5032,I was diagnosed a few years ago as bipolar II and I was given medication.
5033,First medication gave me hives like crazy but worked great also.
5034,"2nd medication made me ""numb""."
5035,I was put on another that I cannot recall now but it didn't resolve the issue of not being able to ejaculate on the 2nd medication and it didn't help so I took myself off of it.
5036,I since have gotten good insurance again and have just gotten medication again.
5037,A completely new medication.
5038,The medication that I have been given is Quetiapine which is generic for Seroquel.
5039,How long did it last and is there anything I could do besides taking antidiarrhea medicine?
5040,"Also taking 15mg Abilify (Day three of this dose and Abilify usually constipates me), 10mg Ambien (at night last night was my second night) 30mg Restoril (at night been on this for two months) and 50mg Vyvanse ( Been on this medicine and dose since March)"
5041,"I felt like I went manic, it was the strangest thing because I've been on these meds for five weeks now and I just thought it would go away, I thought I wouldn't go up up up anymore but I did."
5042,"In taking things a step further, I was well aware of her condition and that she has been hospitalised 6 or 7 times over the last 15 years, but it seemed that she was OK with the meds she has been taking."
5043,She felt she should be off meds completely - although in the past I know that she was accepting and cogniscent of being bipolar.
5044,"I stopped taking my meds a couple months ago in hopes that it would trigger a manic episode, and while the manic episode hasn't happened...I feel a tiny bit better."
5045,"I'm seeing my psych tomorrow, and I know I need to tell her that this medication isn't gonna fly with me."
5046,Has anyone else had weight gain problems on this combination of meds?
5047,I'm at what in my experience is the top of my upside moderated by my medications.
5048,"Another question would be: is medication necessary if not how does one cope, does the medication change you at all?"
5049,"How did it work with medications, hormones, stabilizing, etc?"
5050,I am wondering if any of you on medication have ever had a relapse?
5051,If you are taking medication did it ever stop working??
5052,Have  they gotten better after meds or anything for anyone?
5053,I can tell because they are happy to discharge me on Friday without giving me any medication or indication of what is going on or why this has happened to me.
5054,"so as you can probably guess Chloe lied about taking her meds (*""yes i'm taking them, I just got my dose quadrupled!"
5055,"I've been off medication for about five years, not a single pill."
5056,I used to have a lot of trouble sleeping and could only sleep when I was taking my night time medicine because it caused me to be drowsy.
5057,"But after being off medication for five years I can finally sleep on my own, I'm able to nap."
5058,I used to get people telling me I seemed different when I was switching meds but after five years off I finally feel like myself.
5059,Is anyone else making the choice to stay off meds?
5060,Also I'd prefer for this not to turn into a thread where people tell me that I absolutely need to be on meds.
5061,I like myself better without the medication and I'm wondering who else out there is in the same boat.
5062,"I began college a few years ago at a state university but after a really rough hospitalization where I arrived by ambulance (9 days/nights), tons of medication switches, and overall extreme mood and depression problems, I left that school."
5063,"I went to a psychiatric nurse, got meds and took one of them, it made me feel horrible."
5064,I'm currently not on any medication and I'm doing very well.
5065,It's been maybe a month and a half without any meds.
5066,Should I see a psychiatrist just in case I go into a mood episode at some point and need medication?
5067,Though I'd rather try to get through it without meds.
5068,I just wouldn't want to waste my own or a psychiatrist's time to go in and just refuse meds.
5069,That's been 72 hours off meds now.
5070,How common is that on this medication and is it reversible if I'm prone to it and catch it soon enough?
5071,She then said that i'm fine and that my meds are useless (Seroquel 150mg).
5072,Went down a dark road full of different medications.
5073,From the age of 15 I have struggled with and without psychiatric medications.
5074,For the past two years I have been struggling to survive without medication for the most part.
5075,"I have been diagnosed as bipolar 2 years ago but suffered from it long before my diagnosis, I tried almost every combo of meds that is out there, changed psychiatrists 4 times, got addicted to benzo's, gave up school, to finally find a good doctor
that gave me a good combo that consisted of Wellbutrin 300mg + seroquel 100mg, I became better, got back to school, still struggling with absenteeism because of the huge amount of sleep I need, but when I go to school I am able to focus easily."
5076,"6 months ago I started tapering off my meds with the help of my doctor, first with seroquel 100mg to 75mg to 50mg(had a problem at this point didn't go out for one month but it was solved) and finally I take now 25mg."
5077,"But I don't really know, everybody is noticing my change and my strong fast mood change, I personally like it, after what I've been trough with meds, I think this is better, I feel better, it's like coming back home after a long war, weird, well that's all I hope I'm gonna figure this out, any help would be welcome."
5078,I decided I'm a superhero basically - not in the new agey don't take your meds sort of superhero.
5079,I just also feel like I'm making no progress despite weekly counseling and medication.
5080,"Three years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 disorder, and since then I've been prescribed many types and dosages of different medications."
5081,"Seeing the doctors, getting new medication, and how your brain works in general."
5082,The meds make me so tired.
5083,"I identified as having major depressive disorder for a while, until I finally saw a clinician to ask about getting on meds, and she very quickly picked up that I was talking very fast, very agitated, generally acting sort of... well... manic."
5084,"I do feel like it's way soon after completely changing the entire way I'm looking at my mental illness to be treating it with meds- I've never been on meds before, and I'm having a hard enough time dealing with that idea."
5085,How soon after a diagnosis (or nearly a diagnosis) did y'all start taking meds for bipolar?
5086,"The standard meds don't work for long, if at all."
5087,"If it wasn't for my fiance,I would be homeless right now..
My meds are making me feel and act not right."
5088,"I want medication + therapy, but it's like this guy couldn't answer any of my questions."
5089,"Eventually the depression and mania set back in and I tuned to alcohol to ""calm myself down"" (didn't work too well) and indica-based/CBD heavy strains of marijuana which, actually, seemed to work better than any prescription medication I'd taken."
5090,"After being off medication for so long, I was hesitant to try something again but I was at my wit's end so I did it."
5091,Does anyone else here have any experience with a similar combination of medication?
5092,meds cant help me though this
5093,"I don't stop taking my meds, I just have this horrible feeling I'm just faking it."
5094,I went on meds for three weeks but they did nothing either way for me.
5095,"I'm on 0 meds by the way for three weeks now, not even my ADHD meds."
5096,I can't eat (even though I am not on meds).
5097,"I do have psychotic tendencies because I'm not on medication and often sleep deprived
Tl;Dr is anyone else really aggressive most the time?"
5098,"So here are my questions: 

1- I have a medical form to fill, should I mention anything about bipolar, and should I mention the medications I take ?"
5099,My meds have also been causing me to sleep really late (I woke up at 5pm today) and have difficulties getting to sleep because of anxiety.
5100,I've also got memory loss as well which I think may have been caused as I was abusing my ADHD meds which are no longer prescribed.
5101,"Due to budget cuts in my area (I'm in the UK, the NHS is disappearing under our feet) there's basically no psychiatric services I can access, so I'm left with my GP, who's very nice and all but there's nothing he can actually do as he can't prescribe without a psychiatrist's say so, so I'm trying to find things *I* can do that are non-medication-y so I can get this mood under control and basically be fine again, I'm terrified of getting properly manic (like I did last summer - psychotic, pulling apart household appliances to build a world-saving device, refusing to drink anything not in a sealed bottle) and of course I'm not sleeping which isn't helping, so I guess what I'm asking is, what do you do to calm yourself down??"
5102,"I notice energy levels, motivation levels, anger and irritability with each passing hour, be it from my medication, caffeine, pot, nicotine rushes, common amphetamines(though I haven’t had those in a while due to my addictive nature, I’m smart enough to stay away from it)."
5103,"She's just on anti-depressants, and ADD medicine."
5104,"As a result though I got put on a lot of weird meds right around the time puberty should've happened, stunted the onset of puberty until age seventeen when the doctors had to induce it medically, and I might be sterile?"
5105,"But now, after being on these medications for several months, I'm starting to just feel like I don't have energy, period."
5106,I am almost willing to stop the medication altogether so I can feel those highs again.
5107,Do I just stop taking the medications and embrace the highs and deal with the lows?
5108,"Since I've been on medication, it's been more difficult to tell what sort of mood I'm in, and I've had it sneak up on me a few times."
5109,"I had an abusive upbringing, fought to escape, and have been on many, many psych meds for depression/anxiety/bipolar."
5110,The meds have never done much and were extremely expensive so when I lost my job I stopped taking them.
5111,I cannot reconcile that medication to calm me might dull my brain/wreck my memory.
5112,"I have tried many medications (abilify, zoloft, prazosin, lexapro, alprazoram, effexor, remeron, trazodone, paxil, among others), vitamin supplements, exercised to the point where I was very in shape, meditation, and other things."
5113,"In the first year and a half ish after my diagnosis, I tried three different meds, all antidepressants: Zoloft, Effexor, and Prozac."
5114,"But the meds made me feel the hopelessness and emptiness, and worsened the lack of motivation tenfold."
5115,"During a depressive spell I can usually at least force myself out of bed and to work in the morning, be it late or unkempt or both, but on the meds I couldn't even muster the energy to reach over and turn my alarm clock off."
5116,"Has anyone else experienced this, and found help through an alternate method other than meds?"
5117,Unlike the rest of the UK  prescription medication is also free in Scotland.
5118,My biggest issue is that she's really against treatment besides getting her meds and idk if her doctors knows about what is going on.
5119,"About bipolar, PTSD, my meds, being raped...just way too much information for a first-time encounter."
5120,"He said I could choose the movie, and the only one in theaters I want to see is Side Effects because I'm really into abnormal psych and psychiatry and understand the impact of medication."
5121,"They know about my disorder, they give me the meds because I took all of them once when I failed to die."
5122,Today is my third day on a new medication.
5123,"I haven't been drinking, smoking, on medication... anything... and it all became too much because I was actually ""feeling"" the highs and lows."
5124,"** 

I'm terrified about being on medication."
5125,"but it wasn't like crazy hyperactive spontaneous mania stuff, and he was taking his meds regularly."
5126,"and how do I tell him he needs to take his meds without him getting defensive or thinking I am ""naggy""?"
5127,Is the medication worth the cloudiness?
5128,Is my adhd medicine going to help me?
5129,"In the meantime, I am leveled out more than I have been in a long time thanks to meds and regular exercise, but I am still bipolar and still have my ebbs and flows."
5130,What if I am my best version of myself as a stay at home parent receiving medication and therapy?
5131,"After missing some of my meds for a week, having a best friend have a new baby when I'm desperate for one and after a recent termination (complicated), helping her move out of a potential dv situation while counselling the partner aswell, another friend shooting up ice, and my mother thousands of km's away while I'm in a tiny island community with only one sane friend /ex bf /carer, and an extremely busy pdoc on the mainland Im not surprisingly not coping."
5132,"I'm downstairs in my room, trying to calm down after panicking upstairs with both my mother and sister double-teaming me with yelling and ""Take your meds now, you'll feel better!"""
5133,"I've been really challenged with this since starting my meds 8 months ago, and I see many of you share the same struggle."
5134,Subreddit: www.reddit.com/r/medsmademefat
5135,"I have a therapist, I have a psychologist, I have multiple medications but no matter how diligent I am with the treatment, I know it can come back."
5136,"My therapist thinks that I don't need medication and, by all means, I don't want to."
5137,do any of you have alternatives to psych meds?
5138,it seems like a lot of people on here and elsewhere just see meds as something absolutely necessary.
5139,anyone else against meds here?
5140,"I have not been able to stop it with meds, I have tried."
5141,"I can only hope that I will finally find a balance of meds and lifestyle that can keep me balanced, and finally defeat the evil side of my mania."
5142,I really hope I can get the patient assistance stuff sorted out though as this medication really helps me.
5143,My pre meds manic phases were much more notable.

5149,"* When I'm off my meds, even the bad days aren't awful, because I feel like I have control over it."

Neither of these are mine, but I did download the mood tracker and I love it, and I just bought the bracelet because I don't want to end up in some sort of emergency situation and not get my medication."
5152,I'm not even off my meds.
5153,"I always end up going long enough inbetween episodes, or only with very mild ones that I think I could come off my meds or that I don't actually have this bullshit awful glory going on in my brain, and then something will happen and it'll just turn me into a ball of sunlight searching to scorch or save anyone in my path."
5154,I am stable on meds and have successfully stopped the prescription medication abuse.
5155,"I'm not on the same meds that I was on back then, but I've been on some sort of medication consistently since then."
5156,I didn't even get diagnosed until about a year after I started going on medication.
5157,"I got diagnosed because I had a psychotic break (which led to me being on new medications, and I haven't had any Horrible episodes since I started on that, except for once when I ran out of my medicine and I went completely crazy)."
5158,Without my medication I am completely unstable.
5159,Or is the medication just burying my soul?

5161,I want to get off the Effexor (I really don't want to be on meds while pregnant) and see how I do.

5164,or am I not getting the medication I need because they know I used to self medicate?
5165,My medication has helped me a bit so I think I can do it.

5178,She's on a steady medication and talking with her therapist constantly.
5179,"Hopefully I can get a hold of the doctor this week, I need that new medication."
5180,i still don't know if i want(or can afford) to take meds again but my weirdness and the advice here is swaying me to find something.
5181,The meds have been working really well (can't tell you how happy I am about that).

5192,"I felt my symptoms were under control and I was still taking my meds (I work within the healthcare field, I was still able to get my meds) so I will admit my mental health was not my number one priority on top of all the other stuff I deal with on a day-to-day basis."
5193,"Finally I got my meds back, and was able to go to sleep."
5194,I am totally aware at how foolish it is to mess with my own meds.

5207,I am currently on Wellbutrin (Buprion) and Risperdal for medication.
5208,I cannot get off this medication as it greatly reduces the delusions(constant state of paranoia) that I have and it helps me sleep.

5215,I highly recommend it to people having a hard time finding the right meds.

5225,"I just wanted to share with everyone the following:

For people with bipolar disorder, you have a lot of feelings of emptiness, lack of control over what's happening around you, this sort of sense that something is missing (even when on your meds), and worst of all: the triggers - gosh there are so many triggers and some of them, seemingly harmless to the average person, can really stick with us and upset us, sometimes for a long, long time."
5226,"(Clarification: I started my medication and will be using them for the rest of my life but doctor said I didn't need to be closed to a clinic for severe treatment)

Which is true."
5227,I hate looking at my grades at the end of the semester because I'm terrified that it's going to be horrible like it was my first year before I started medication.

5246,I've never really noticed any objective improvement due to medication.
5247,Family members would disagree usually because I tend to stop taking my medication for a while and then when I'm all burnt out and normalized I'm open to the idea of medication so some people correlate the medication use as a cause for me acting normal when it is actually the other way around (although I have no way to verify if it did help or not).

5420,*I would not be here without the help of /u/Offmymeds007 and a few other users from replies to my post on the two subs.
5421,"The doctor told me I am ""barely"" bipolar and my symptoms were not all that bad so I manage decently well with out meds."

5423,Unfortunately he refuses to take meds.
5424,"I have medication, but at the same time, I have to do my best to manage daily life."
5425,I am cautious about taking them and really only do if I'm having a panic attack or flying BUT what's bothering me is that he knows I was hospitalized for being suicidal and the reason I had gone in to get my meds adjusted (which was when I was given the valium) was because I had started cutting and feeling suicidal again.
5426,"Also i had this side effect once before but that was after heavy exercise and when i was on abilify 

My meds are currently Lamika, Abilify (going off it, will be off by next week), Lamotrigine and Strattera."
5427,Im really scared to bring this up with my psych/pdoc as I dont want to add more meds into the mix.
5428,Are there any bipolar meds that won't make me hate my life?
5429,It's the only medication I've tried for my mood though.
5430,Am I gonna have to be on meds forever?
5431,"Once my anxiety meds kick in around 10, i usually am fine, but its the actual early morning routine of getting myself to work that is hard for me."
5432,"I'm not on medication, because the medicine I was prescribed when I was first diagnosed and treated 3 years ago (seroquel, lamictal) made me ill to the point of nonfunctioning."
5433,"I have an appointment with a doctor in a couple weeks, with whom I'll discuss the possibility of getting black on klonopin (and possibly other medications, if the doctor has any experience treating bp) and ask for a referral to a psychiatrist."
5434,"It doesn't help that while I always have great rapport with therapists, I was told by a different psychiatrist once that ""we're running out of options here"" for medication, which made me feel utterly hopeless."
5435,"While I think medication is an absolutely crucial part of treatment for depression and anxiety for many patients, I think psychiatrists themselves can be hasty and incomplete in their diagnoses and prescriptions."
5436,But it does noting to sober you up from the grips of hell aka your meds aka your lifeline.
5437,"Solution: upping my medication, now I try and force myself but I just cannot."
5438,I have been off meds for a year now due to no insurance and things haven't been much better or worst.
5439,After deciding to take myself off of my meds.... let's just say that was a huge mistake.
5440,I realize that there is a medications master list but I'm curious about who has had experience with Lamictal (Lamotrigine) in particular.
5441,I'm trying to make a list of positive things to do while off of my meds.
5442,"Certainly a factor could be the medications available, learning your triggers, etc."
5443,"I took a shower, and reflected a bit on the last few days - I guess I have been a little snappy, a little anxious, a little too sure that finally my meds are all working and I'm so close to being stable enough to go to school."
5444,Several meds and 2 different p-doc's and now a weekly therapist.
5445,"I'm not ready to go back, especially if I have to try new meds (they're talking  Prozac, Lexapro, and something else) and deal with adjustments and side effects."
5446,I'm on medication.
5447,What meds helped you get out of an episode?
5448,"The hospitalization, the shrink visits, the medication, the change on medication, the withdrawal from previous medication, the change in personality from current medication, the hypo-mania, the depression, the concerned family, the morons who stigmatize, the delusions, the suicidal ideation etc.."
5449,"So I've been medicated for almost a year now, coming into my third medicated mood swing at the moment and I'm just finding it so hard to keep taking my meds."
5450,"He has begun sleepwalking, and sleep eating and drinking recently and we think this is a side affect of both his meds (lithium and seroquol)."
5451,Is this something where he may need to change his meds?
5452,"Basically, the only reason I'm on medication right now is because my deductible was paid."
5453,Since his hospitalization he has been on medicine and it is good....most of the time.
5454,I know that there is an adjustment period with the meds and that it will be rocky every once in a while.
5455,They took me through six different medications and eventually landed back on lexapro with amitriptyline.
5456,"The counselor along with the doctor and nurse thought maybe a medication switch would help, so here I am at home on a leave of absence."
5457,"He recommended doing one of those psychopharmacology psych drug test things to see how I would react to the different meds and get dosage recommendations, since we are on a time crunch."
5458,"I can go without the hospitalization but the meds are necessary, without them I am suicidal and a danger to others."
5459,"I am prescribed a mild narcotic and sleeping medication, of which help mask some issues but I think I'm done with taking these."
5460,"So, on top of dropping the needless narco/sleep med routine, and edging twoards a better diet, mixed with a bit more exercise with spring coming, should I just pop some St. John's Wort or something, down a cappuccino and just hammer away at life like most people apparently do, or does it sound more like there are some glaring issues that need a specific medication or therapy?"
5461,"If so, what meds, or what self-help subjects can I read into to learn more?"
5462,Is it mild depression or something more like bi-polar disorder needing meds or therapy?
5463,"You Might...

Stop taking your meds
Think you're the shit
Sit alone
Dwell on it

Ask yourself why
""Why'd it happen to me?"""

5466,"Now I just have break through manic episodes more frequently than I think I should considering all the meds I'm on, and I have the same symptoms I always had, minus the racing thoughts:  shaky, sweaty, incredibly tense, difficulty breathing, unable to speak to anyone without tripping over words, or really even deal with people in general."
5467,"If so, what meds are you on and do they seem to be helping?"
5468,"then my meds went ""lawl glad you think you're doing okay!"

5470,"I know I'm on medication, but sometimes I just want to feel like I can do anything and be able to drink and smoke with people...Well, I smoked today, and it triggered some things I felt and saw when I was psychotic."
5471,"I stayed really quiet until I sobered up, but I saw that faceless guy I saw before I was on meds who terrified me into screaming about attempted murder a few months ago (I barely avoided being hospitalized)."
5472,I've emailed my therapist asking if this is normal and if I should ride it out or stop the medication right away.
5473,I have been reading through posts here recently and it seems like a lot of people really focus on medication (which is good) but I don't see very many posts of therapy when people are struggling.
5474,It is very important to do both with Bipolar because meds don't fix everything.
5475,"I find it weird sometimes, but there are some side effects that I would prefer to experience, while others end medication because of them."

5484,"I still can't believe that both my grand-mother and her brother have been on medication for years and didn't tell any of their children, or that it is very likely that all of the suicides in this side of the family might have been caused by bipolar disorder."
5485,I bet I am misdiganosed I once woke up anxious after a night of not sleeping NOT MANIC I took my medication and I don't feel extremely horny like I did when I was mAnIc!

5528,I just started medication again (mood stabilizer) a few weeks ago.
5529,Since being diagnosed and put on the right medication as well as discussing my diagnoses with family and friends (which I know can be really hard) my life is back on track.
5530,I know not everyone has such easy luck with medication/support but I just thought it would be good to share stories about how being bipolar does not need to be such a negative thing as people seem to think it is.
5531,"This is a much bigger issue than I thought, still having implications in my life a year later, I thought the medicine was done and I was fixed and I would never need adjusting and and and..."
5532,"It seems that my upswings always involve some degree of anxiety, but I'm wondering if these episodes I've experienced in the past few months (since switching meds) are mixed states."

5534,"I was a few months months back, and I havent ever been on medication."

5546,"He usually is able to handle things pretty well, he told me his therapist says he does ""surprisingly well"" for not being on meds."
5547,I am uncomfortable about pushing meds on him because I know they can be awful.
5548,"I talked to him about it a bit last night and he sounds pretty closed off to the idea of meds right now, though he has sounded open to it at other times."
5549,"He said he has heard that being bipolar on meds makes everything seem boring, or they can just make things emotionally dead."
5550,"I understand his fear, and I also think that he fears that he doesn't have enough time to try out a bunch of meds until he finds the right one, because he will be feeling weird for potentially a significant chunk of time, and he is in a very intense program in college that he can't sacrifice."
5551,"I have read in this subreddit as well as the bipolarSO subreddit some people's experiences with meds, and it seems to me that the right meds can make this disorder much more manageable."

5560,I'm taking meds for it...and they helped a bit but not enough.
5561,"The medication gave me such awful headaches and after my second semester, I took time off from school and stopped taking my medication."
5562,For those few months I had better control and I thought I could stay off medication.
5563,I just thought I should share and stay on your meds!
5564,I got my medication tweaked a week and a half ago and I'm actually starting to feel more level.
5565,"I'm not sure if it's the meds or two different people telling me that if I don't do something to help myself, I won't feel better..so I started doing things."
5566,Do you think it could be the change in meds?
5567,"Some are worsen than others, and every few months I heavily question whether or not I should go back to taking meds."
5568,"I used to oscillate between rage, depression, and mania; now I'm almost a year off any effective amount of medication and stable to five nines."
5569,What medication do you guys recommend going on and what should i watch out for given that I'm bipolar.

5577,"I'm about a month away from being able to go back on meds, so don't worry too much."
5578,I'm starting to think - why not stop the meds and just accept the highs and lows.
5579,I was on meds when I was 15 and first diagnosed.
5580,I should go on meds.
5581,This is the first day ive doubted the meds.
5582,atleast off the meds i had a brisk of suspense.
5583,"I'm unmedicated, I've tried various medicines for extended periods throughout the past 2 years."
5584,"Including ""self-medication"" (if you know what I mean...)."
5585,Most type 2's may go many years without ever being diagnosed or on psychiatric medications because they don't typically become hospitalized.
5586,"And even if they are aware that they might be suffering with a mental illness willingly going in to get help from a psychiatrist and to get on medication is not typically on anyone's ""to-do"" list."
5587,"Started getting treatment, on a lot of meds, everything worked really well for a long time."
5588,"I don't know if I took my medicine or not, I feel like I didn't, but I also feel like I remember taking it and I'm too scared to take more."
5589,Or could it be something with my meds?
5590,"So we wake up every morning and we give it our best, we struggle, we get sick from medication, but we do it because we're worth it."
5591,"I have seen far too many discussions about diagnosing, medication advice, and off label medication that is indeed incorrect."
5592,"I know recovery is going to be rough but I'm taking my medication and starting to eat right , exercise, and decided to learn the harmonica."
5593,"Tons of trauma (raised alone by mom often off meds), but strong, optimistic personality plagued by these bouts of terrorizing fear-hibernation."
5594,I heard all the medicines are even worse ( I have stomach issues too).
5595,I ended up waking up at 2:30AM and was so depressed that I immediately went into my night stand to find all the meds I could.
5596,"Anyway my point being is, since seeing a psychiatrist and toying with the tentative diagnosis of Bipolar II, I've almost worn myself into the ground stressing about various aspects of it, the potential for neurodegeneration, the effects of medication, the chronic nature, how it might affect work etc."
5597,I quit exercising after becoming very depressed and medication made me gain a lot of weight.
5598,"I've been diagnosed

but I'm still questioning everything

what if I'm not

what if I was just making excuses

what if I convinced myself of something

and then convinced others of something

and now I'm un-convincing myself

but I can't un-convince the others

what if I'm just melodramatic

maybe I just wanted to not be responsible

for my drug use

when I did drugs

maybe I don't really have a problem

and sure the medication works

but if I convinced myself I was crazy of course it would work

and what effects would it have on a person who didn't need it

it's also an antiepileptic

I don't have epilepsy

but I'm not especially not having seizures

because you can't do that

""oh, look, she's not having seizures

she's cured""

cured of what?"
5599,"how would anybody know 

how would I know

and I take the medications because if they do anything

they're working

but how do I know that I actually need them?"
5600,"I only take one type of medication

how many meds do you have to take

some people take three meds

some people never find the right meds

how did I find the right single medication on the first try?"
5601,"it seems suspicious

maybe I don't sleep because I don't want to sleep

I pulled three all-nighters last week

but I was studying

and I slept 10 hours right in the middle of it

sure I felt energetic despite the lack of sleep

but I didn't feel good or bad

I didn't fuck anybody

I didn't buy anything

and I've been taking my meds

maybe I'm not crazy

but everyone thinks I'm crazy

but I can't un-crazy myself

because that would be a thing that a crazy person would do

sorry for using the word crazy

I don't like being called crazy

but sometimes I just can't decide whether or not I feel crazy

fuck


and somebody is probably going to look at the way I wrote this and say ""you're manic, go to a hospital before you start thinking you're abraham lincoln and you lost your beard"" but I don't feel manic."
5602,"I'm not going to stop taking my medication

because if I did and found out I did need it after all

I don't want to spend all that time titrating up from 25 to 200 milligrams

I'm just going to stop typing now

EDIT: mixed feelings – glad I'm not alone here, but also sorry you guys feel the same way!"
5603,"I have been ill many years and tried to end it all once or twice, been on medication for about 6 months now, but it just doesnt get easier."
5604,"I know 6 months of medication isnt a long time in the long run, but for someone who is fighting just to get out of bed most days its a hell of a long time."
5605,"Ive tried different medication and i just started with Lithium a day ago, this will be my last shot, if this doesnt work i dont know what to do... im also on 3 different antidepressents and still im so depressed, what am i supposed to do :( please if you have any advice on how to make things easier just share, or something, i dont know.. getting kind of desperate over here."
5606,I am able to function like a normal human being now because my psychiatrist found the right medication for me.
5607,The medication he has me on right now is Latuda 40mg and Lamictal 25mg.
5608,"As far as medications and treatment, we're both third years at University and she's currently on lamictal after being on lithium to no avail."
5609,I am unsure if this is related to medications I took in the past or if this is an issue that just comes with being Bipolar... Or if this is something different entirely.
5610,"Sister has gone to a doctor to get meds, but missed follow-ups since then."
5611,She is angry with me because this has happened before and I could not come get her because I had taken a drowsiness-inducing medication before bed and was not fit to drive.
5612,I seen her on medicine before and I loved it when she was on it.
5613,She tried different medicine and all the same results.
5614,She hasn't taken her medicine in past 2 years.
5615,I need some advice on what you guys think will help me get to start taking her medicine.
5616,Please share any success stories of how you were able to persuade a bipolar family relative to take medicine or if you have a relative that persuaded you into taking the medicine.

5618,I’m taking my meds.
5619,I lost my medication for a week.
5620,For one of my medications it means I basically need to start from scratch and step back up to the right dosage over weeks.
5621,"I know some of this is the meds thing and am doing my best at not letting the anxiety take hold, but it is driving me mad slightly...

Work is really great, except that every other day we go to the animal shelter."
5622,"Stop taking your meds, go into a delusional, paranoid, mixed, suicidal or manic state, and you'd better hope you don't run into any ""helpful"" law enforcement."
5623,What was your experience with Lithium being added to your meds?
5624,"I don't know if my medication is helping, at times I've felt things are getting worse, but the rest of the time it's anhedonia.... but perhaps this is 'normal'?"
5625,"I can't think of any true benefits, I'm not after medication, but maybe i'm looking for an easy pass, an excuse for my declining grades?"
5626,"I've been on what feels like a bajillion different meds for various things (insomnia, bipolar, depression, anxiety, pain, etc."
5627,Is there something wrong with me that my body doesn't respond to medications?
5628,"Seriously, I've been on A LOT of different types of meds and I've been to a bunch of different drs and psychs."
5629,"Suddenly starting to feel like complete shit, and it gets really bad at night, I can't sleep despite taking several medications to try to do so, I just stay awake worrying and panicking and just wanting to cry all night for no real reason."
5630,"Just so no one worries I am in treatment I see a therapist and I'm on an herbal medication regiment to help with my ups and downs, so I've got a support system it's just nice to have an online one now."
5631,I've noticed a little difference since the medication but I still feel like I'm in a bad place.
5632,"And I am starting to wonder if it's because I'm being misdiagnosed and, as a result, being treated with the wrong meds."
5633,I'm on medication right now and it's made me gain 50 lbs so now I'm borderline diabetic and my meds cost $400 a month.
5634,"i had been doing super well over the last few months since changing medication, after an extremely difficult year before that - hospital and shit like that."

5639,Stayed up all night and skipped my medicine Saturday morning.
5640,"I did take my regular dose of meds this morning, but I'm feeling extra crappy."

5660,"I take all my medicine, listen to my doctors."
5661,"I don't have a ton of money to spare, and I'm better acquainted with my pharmacological needs, at this point, than any 6 sessions could produce with a new doc (which, in my area, could easily cost well over $1,000 w/o meds)."

5665,"I have a few questions:  Does anyone know if, once you start taking meds you actually end up more likely to need them?"
5666,"Back to my point though: would going off meds most likely make my symptoms worse than they were back then, before my episode?"

5706,Has anyone had this problem while on any of these medications?
5707,"I copy and pasted the article for those that don't wish to register at medscape (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/741999) below:

Bipolar disorder, a chronic, relapsing brain disorder, usually develops in the late teens or early adult years, with half of all cases starting before age 25."
5708,"Following the hypothesis that lower cholesterol levels may be associated with mood disorders, it is reasonable to ask if cholesterol-lowering medications are associated with increased depression and suicidal ideation."
5709,A meta-analysis of large clinical trials of lipid-lowering agents did not show an association between use of these medications and rates of suicide.
5710,"[5]

Statin medications with low lipophilicity (eg, pravastatin) are less likely to cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore may be less likely to cause cognitive or psychiatric adverse effects."
5711,Patients should be carefully monitored during treatment because many medications used to treat bipolar disorder can worsen metabolic abnormalities.
5712,"I imagine many of you are on cocktails of meds, like I am."
5713,"Self harm, suicidal thoughts, intense manias, self medication in form of drugs and alcohol."
5714,My medication is working.
5715,"She quit therapy after 14 years, quit taking her medication, and started becoming extremely paranoid."
5716,"The last few times she realized she was having issues and she would check herself into a ward to rebalance her medications (She also has diabetes, lupus, and McArdles disease) and within a month she would be doing better."
5717,I can't make her take her medication.
5718,I am pretty sure that once her medications are being taken again that she will be back to her as normal as it gets self...but I don't know how to handle this.
5719,"had the mother of all breakdowns earlier this year and went through many different meds before settling on lamotrigine, which i'm still on."

5721,"i've started taking my meds again, but is there anything else i can do?"
5722,"I feel like even though life is awful and it sucks, today is easier than yesterday because the new meds will change things."
5723,I need new medications.
5724,She just started going to the psychiatrist and they want to do all the physical exams before putting her on any medication.
5725,I can't get medication because I can't see a psychiatrist because I don't have health insurance because I don't make enough money to get covered and medicaid isn't responding.
5726,I have never been on medication long enough for it to do anything.
5727,Does anyone take meds that help with this?
5728,"Hi,
**TLDR**
**Take your meds!"
5729,"**

I'm BP 1 and I just came back from a manic episode that nearly destroyed my life/ It started when I stopped taking my meds shortly after being hospitalized due to the effects of my old med - Abilify."
5730,"So, I get out of the hospital, take my meds for a few days than BAM - miss a therapist appointment."
5731,"Then BAM miss my nighttime meds because I fell asleep, then BAM - missed my psych appointment then BAM missed my meds 3 times in a row."
5732,"I have a lot of work to do to put my life back together, Take your meds, see your doctor."
5733,I feel like if I weren't on my medication I'd be manic right now.
5734,My family doesn't have a clue as to how big of an impact my medication has made on my life.
5735,I don't think they understand that I'm going to commit suicide if I'm taken off this medication.
5736,I understand that I'm still in the process of increasing my doses with her but I felt like she didn't even care to see how I was actually doing before she changed the meds.
5737,I know I need medication to reveal my truer self again.
5738,I know the meds spike my blood sugar so its not just what I'm eating.
5739,"I have tried quite a few medications (anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-anxiety, mood stabilizers) all in different combinations from the time I was 16."
5740,"I just need to vent, 

I was diagnosed bipolar II, along with a few anxiety disorders, about a year and a half ago and since then I've been on many different medications all with the side effect of weight gain."
5741,"then I managed to leave the house to get my perscriptions, because im aware enough to know i need them drugs, so when i got home i took, not one, but 2 days worth you know to catch up on 3 missed days(daily meds 1valtrax, 1 welbutrin, 2 paxil, 3 seroquel, 3 lamotragin) times 2."
5742,"I still have my other meds, and I never have trouble getting the Lamictal or Prozac."
5743,EDIT: I have been given medication.
5744,"She just started taking meds about 5 weeks now and it seems like every saturday or sunday she tends to get either a little irritable or kinda bleak, like she has no negative or positive emotions."
5745,So once the BP1 diagnosis was finally made I was given the miracle of effective medication!
5746,What is the goal of taking medication?
5747,The more I research Bipolar I and mania and examine my lifestyle the more I think that my medication is just not what it could be.
5748,Is the goal of medication to stop all mania?
5749,"My parents are willing to pay for me to see a private psychiatrist to consult with on medication, but I'm not sure how I feel about that."
5750,I'm now 23 and unfortunately unmedicated due to insurance issues and the cost of meds without it.
5751,"It didn't matter what the directions were, they could be to stop taking meds, or to commit some heinous crime at the other end of the spectrum."
5752,I'll have to go off of meds if I leave.
5753,"Now I will start this off by saying this isn't a 100% thing or a ""fix""

When I was 16 I got it stuck in my head that I didn't want to be dependent on drugs of any sort so I went off my meds and turned myself around."
5754,"Now as I am writing this I am getting a feeling that most people are going to be thinking ""Well it isn't that easy to just stay calm""
and that is how I got off meds, cause I realized that all the doctors and other people saying it is hard created a reality in which I thought it was hard but if you do your best and keep at it you will find it is easier to control your moods then you would have ever imagined."
5755,Mostly when I forgot to take my meds on time.
5756,"My girlfriend was diagnosed bipolar when she was young, I forgot what age, but she has been on medication for since high school."
5757,"It took six medications before I found one that worked for me, Lamictal ODT."
5758,"But, with the proper meds, therapy, and general improved outlook on life its allowed me to turn my life around in such a short time."
5759,To those that are suffering and to those on medication who can't seem to find something that works for them... keep trying!
5760,"She's been with a therapist for about half of that, she took a long break for about a year or two and has recently been going back for about 2 months and is back on medication."
5761,My psychologist won't refer me to a new psychiatrist because his colleagues reviewed my case and they said that I tried enough meds already without success.
5762,I can't get a referral to a psychiatrist to try new meds.
5763,"Even if they don't believe I'm bipolar, couldn't they at least let me try depression/anxiety meds outside of SSRIs and antipsychotics???"
5764,"It has been about a year at this point I think, but I am generally very bad at taking meds so there were times when a 1 month prescription would last me much longer than it should have."
5765,"I also have a tricky situation with my health insurance(which covers the meds, but not the appointments) that would make it so lamictal could be a lot more expensive for me in the future, so right now this is for the best."
5766,"I'm just now having a sip of alcohol in a legitimate attempt of ""self-medication"" to see if it helps me loosen up."
5767,"Therapy, meds, and support groups have all yielded no result."
5768,"So, for the longest time I thought that the mania that was triggered by the copious amounts of antidepressants shoved down my throat was the meds working."
5769,How long can it take to find a good med or combination of meds?
5770,I'm wondering what the process of tweaking meds is like and what I can expect once I figure out something that works.
5771,"**""Well, are you taking [your] medication?"
5772,Without medication I am simply not functional.
5773,It's not as if I don't realize that medication is an option and how it might help me.
5774,If I'm diagnosed (which you would know if you're asking that question) then I've definitely talked with a doctor and medication has definitely been one of the topics.
5775,"And hey, maybe they're just trying to open up a discussion and want to know how it's going or, if I'm not taking medication, why."
5776,"My brain is different, and medication is a tool to make me more compatible with the world."
5777,**The reason it makes me so frustrated and so insulted is that there's the idea that it's my obligation and my duty to be on medication.
5778,"I have the right to live without medication and to make the choice to not take them because I don't like the side effects, or because I like having my mood cycles, or I can't afford it, or any reason I can fathom."
5779,Encourage me to take medication all you want but don't you dare to suggest or imply that it's what I ought to do.
5780,Unlike me she does not take medication and will not even admit to having a problem.
5781,"i currently am stable on medication and am thinking about graduate school, but competition seems to be rough."
5782,I stopped taking medication about eight months ago.
5783,I also just couldn't afford to keep paying out of pocket for medicine.
5784,I don't know what I am going to do without medication and therapy.
5785,"For those who suffer and are not on medication and don't see a therapist, what has helped you get through each day?"
5786,Feel like stopping meds as they clearly aren't working.
5787,"I've been on various medications in various combinations since March 2003, until late November 2011, with a stint of 15ish ECT treatments in September/October 2011."
5788,"Fuck being bipolar, fuck meds, fuck doctors, fuck people who are not willing to try and understand (like my birch of a fucking sister), fuck everything!!!"
5789,I don't cycle much since being put on meds about a year ago and when I do cycle now it's generally mild but I'm going through an episode that reminds me of old times.
5790,"The doctor gave him medicine, but the medicine caused some kind of brain damage from what I understand."
5791,"I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in March and while the diagnosis could explain a lot of my past behaviour and experiences, I'm questioning whether my current symptoms are just a product of my medications and whether I really have bipolar."
5792,Part of me wants to stop my meds to find out what I'm really like.
5793,I want to know if I'm really hypomanic or just elevated and not sleeping because of the medications (I know that Abilify can be activating).
5794,"My psychiatrist prescribed more meds to kick me out of hypomania but I'm reluctant to take them because I don't want to just be treating the side effects of one medication with another, especially if I don't even have bipolar."
5795,"I have a really good relationship with my pdoc, he's super smart and responsive but you know how it is, those sessions are short and it's all centered around side effects and medication management."
5796,"I got put on medication and now I'm, like, functional?"
5797,"I take my meds, eat healthy, meet new people, explore my passions, ahahhhahhhahh, I go to sleep and its there."
5798,"I am on lexapro 20mg abilify 10mg and wellbutrin 450mg and I am almost out of medication because my doctor dumped me a couple of months ago because I need a ""higher level of care"" according to him."
5799,He was only willing to prescribe me medication for a month after he dumped me and now I am running out of that.
5800,tl;dr: psych dumped me a months ago running out of meds and entering a depressive phase.
5801,"I got some better meds and I'm starting to feel a little better, I'm just lonely."
5802,I’m beginning to think that it’s a good thing I stopped taking my meds because I can control my episodes before they start by self-medicating with either benzos or barbiturates.
5803,The problem is I hate leaving my medication out in fear that someone will see them and ask.what its for.
5804,"For those of you have had someone find their medication did you explain the situation, or tell a white lie?"
5805,"I think, and I'm still ramping up my meds."
5806,Hi I had a follow up with my awesome neurologist who is keeping an eye on me while I'm not on meds.
5807,Ever since the raising and dropping of the medication started my life has felt like a living hell.
5808,"I remember why I vowed to never touch this shit again, cause I can't function on a daily basis now without popping 2-4 xanax without waking up then mixing it with my other meds."
5809,"I hoped the medication would bring back ""me."""
5810,"Because i already feel flat, don't want to be a zombie and can't fuck my meds up because i work a professional job."
5811,"I have been on a slew of medications, but my current (and very effective) mood stabilizer is lithium."
5812,I went to my primary care doctor for what turned out to be a viral infection and she changed my diagnosis from bipolar II to bipolar I. I was first diagnosed with BPII a little over two years ago and was lucky to be on a good blend of meds.
5813,About a year in I got hurt and wasn't focused on mental health so I stopped therapy and meds.
5814,Today I went to my new PCP and when she asked how I was doing off my meds I said not so good and answered all of her questions honestly.
5815,He didn't change any of my meds &amp; I'm not showing any signs of upcoming episodes.
5816,"I confronted him with this epiphany and he responded by putting me directly into the looney bin, and the entire time I was there, I was convinced that I didn't need to be and the medication they were prescribing was going to ruin my mind and take away all the creativity and brilliance that I was currently experiencing."
5817,"I keep waiting for the medications my doctor prescribes to somehow change my outlook, but ultimately I feel like they also won't do anything to fix me without the effort on my part which I don't feel capable of making."
5818,"but from what I've come to understand from this year specifically (one of the best ones so far), I've had only one incident where I lashed out in self defense and it was because I started taking a medication that wasn't prescribed to me."
5819,My mom and brother didn't think that medication was wise for me to take and so I had an episode because my brother tried to choke me (same brother who had a rough time and had another mental breakdown this year.)
5820,"It just doesn't feel like that's me, perhaps in the past it was, but I've gone a long way without medication and I still take my medication sporadically because my belief is that all human beings have the capacity to cure themselves.i"
5821,TL;DR:  Anyone with predominantly agitated/irritable/anxious hypomania find that medication has made their elevated moods resemble more 'typical' hypomania?
5822,All he's been doing lately is obsessing over his moods and medications and watching kung fu movies.
5823,"I was diagnosed when I was a kid with ADHD, but my parents didn't want to put me on medication."
5824,"My dad was on meds for ADHD when he was a kid and did not like what it did to him, so they chose not to put it me on them."
5825,Does anybody have any advice on how I can manage while I'm not on medication?
5826,"Staying on top of my meds is what is key, and having kept an eye on the forums and the stories you all have shared kept it in the forefront of my mind."
5827,I'm figuring out a good medicine combination.
5828,"Therapy isn't helping, medicines aren't helping."
5829,I don't want to go back where I was before (I don't care if I am on a medication).
5830,For at least the past month my mom has been experiencing delusions and hallucinations which came about shortly after she stopped taking her medication against our advice.
5831,"Hi everyone (cry for help/rant time)

I thought I was okay on my meds (Depakote, bipolar 2 supposedly) , just trundling on with life which was more than likely caused by smoking weed because it makes me not feel like shit."
5832,I've always hated takings meds.
5833,I quit my meds cold turkey early Oct.
5834,I'm trying to convince myself that meds are important and may be needed due to my recent behaviors that lead to extreme irresponsibility.
5835,"A little over a year ago, my life was like this: secret drug addiction to prescription meds, moderate drinking issue, super pretty girlfriend, lots of friends, partied a lot, and was basically letting the mania get me as far as I can while trying to hide/suppress the depression."
5836,"I find myself thinking dark thoughts and getting intense impulses to have manic sex, get back into drugs, quit my medication, and become violent and break things around me."
5837,He mentioned once that he felt my doctor diagnosed me as bipolar and put me on medicine so he could make more money.
5838,Does this sound like it's from meds?
5839,I'm wondering if this could be from meds.
5840,"In the mean time, we decided to change my medication."
5841,"I've been on my current medication for a few months now, and I've noticed a huge drop in i guess my touch with reality."
5842,( on meds 3 years) I convinced myself that I didnt need that shit to be normal.
5843,"Anyway, she's tried different medications (trazadone, melatonin, benadryl, exercising more to try to sleep but at one point she says she was awake for 3 days straight and now it's happening again."
5844,"I posted this a while back and am still anxious about the whole pregnancy thing with my wife who has BP (or BPD, we still don't know for certain)

http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarSOs/comments/332t48/pregnancy_should_we_do_it/

Has anyone else here, after understanding and being diagnosed, gone through (on medication) with your pregnancy?"
5845,"She is currently on 40mg Latuda and I can't remember the Seroquel dosage at night, and 1mg anti-anxiety meds for bed."
5846,"They keep saying to admit all medications/health issues on the form ""for our own good - if you need help/emergency/etc""."
5847,"He's been in treatment for a few months, and for a while it seemed like he was doing well on his medication."
5848,"Also, can he be hypomanic on meds and/or can an episode last for months?"
5849,"but now, progress with my medication and therapy at least makes it so I can work this part time job after hours twice a week, and I want to apply."
5850,I like this medication best.
5851,I'm just concerned about the medication.
5852,"I work 40 hour work weeks, I make lesson plans every week, I teach 24 amazing kids, I take my medicine like I should and see my doctors like I should so why should I have to be afraid to tell people I have bipolar disorder?"
5853,My doctor just switched my meds from cymbalta to Effixor and Rameron.
5854,My doctor told me the only other medication that doesn't produce those side effects is welbutrin.
5855,We go off meds.
5856,We go off meds at an alarming rate.
5857,"I am looking for personal stories about problems getting medication, finding treatment specialists, finding treatment specialists who take insurance, insurance problems."
5858,She stole my keys and my meds.
5859,"After months of changing meds around and even taking some time off to get better, I'm still not quite stable, and my schedule and finances (SO was laid off 5 months ago and despite applying to several places every week, he's only had one interview, which could have gone better) just keep getting more stressful."
5860,"I got food poisoning this weekend and threw up my meds, along with everything else in my stomach through all of friday night/Saturday morning, and didn't get any sleep."
5861,"This, I assume, is partly due to a finally functioning medication, and partly because I've learned a bit better how to deal with it."
5862,One concerned medicine.
5863,It's fucking unacceptable the number of people we have on here in a week bloody suffering because of inadequate access in America to something as simple as medication.
5864,"Now, we all know that medication is only one component of a treatment plan--but it's a very important component and even a brief interruption in access comes with repercussions that can have devastating impacts on the life of the individual, our families, and society itself."
5865,I'm also waking up feeling rather hungover from my meds as I'm getting up earlier than I used to as I need to get my daughter ready for school and shaking that cotton brain feeling isn't happening all that well.
5866,I need to get my meds reviewed so I can not feel so groggy.
5867,I can't afford medication so yeah.
5868,"Eating healthy, working out, writing, taking medications."
5869,How do I get off all of these meds?
5870,Could they be connected to the medications I'm taking: Lithium and Lamictal?
5871,How has being on medicine helped or hurt you?
5872,I've been on meds for four years... My disease has given me a perspective on and love for life I wouldn't trade for health... And people seem to get it.
5873,I haven't had a proper low mood and my medication seems to be doing the trick it's just during the day I get incredibly bored.
5874,"I can't take meds, can't afford them."
5875,"Now that I am 115 days sober and back on medications, I am doing so much better."
5876,I seem to be up and borderline manic more than depressed right now so I will take it until we really get my meds dialed in.
5877,What they are planning to do is diagnose me then work with my primary care doctor as far as continuing medication from there.
5878,Or are medication changes super common?
5879,He put me on meds and the symptoms got worse and worse over time.
5880,"So, 4 days later, I was out and diagnosed with Bipolar 2 Disorder, severe, General Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD, and several new medications, but very little idea of what to expect or how to deal with things."
5881,"So, what I've noticed since the change in medication and getting out of the hospital is an increase in my sensitivity (I cry at the drop of a hat), a nearly constant feeling of anxiety that the Ativan helps with, but that returns fairly quickly (I'm taking 1.0, and it lasts approximately 3.5-4.5 hours), flashes of anger that have me yelling at a person (this has happened twice since I've been out."
5882,He changed his meds some time ago without telling me.
5883,"Suddenly, I am struggling to swallow my meds."
5884,I have no reason to have anxiety about any of these medications.
5885,"Like any mood stabilizer, I get frustrated with the lack of manic highs and cognitive dulling, but this medicine has been the cornerstone of my treatment ever since I was diagnosed and I would never want to change it."
5886,"I don't wanna lose this medicine, but I don't want to risk this side effect!"
5887,Where else do I go from here besides the therapy and medication treatment?
5888,She was diagnosed with bipolar ~20 years ago and with medication and therapy her episodes have been mild.
5889,"Except this time, I'm back on my meds, I'm getting my life back together and I'm staying in touch with my friends."
5890,"I'm on several medications, with lots of side effects, but they keep me functional so I suffer through it."
5891,"It got to a point where I was hospitalized for a mental breakdown, I was put on medications that eventually made me feel even worse and was hospitalized again."
5892,Now I was finally diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder last year after suffering with it for the last 10 years (I'm 25) been taking meds since then and my life has had an almost miraculous turn around.
5893,Before we broke up in December I OD'ed on my meds and had to go to the hospital.
5894,"What'll usually happen is I'll deal with the meds, the side effect, the stigma and the usual bullshit, until I can't, I'll get pissed off and frustrated so I'll go off them."
5895,"And I'll go with that until I can't bear it any more, and in a burst of motivation, I'll seek help, and start it all again with new meds and doctors and all that stuff."
5896,"Right now I'm getting frustrated with the meds again, but I'm feeling pretty isolated and cut off, and I can't see a way out of this."
5897,"I was off my meds for a week, not on purpose, more of a my pharmacy ran out of my meds and so I just waited to get a call they had it in."
5898,In the coming months I sought treatment and was put on medication which I'm now still on though the dosage is somewhat reduced in comparison to what it was.
5899,My mental health care nurse who is my main therapist (I see my psychiatrist only for medication tweaks) has told me that I need to be more gentle with myself but not to stop doing the things that bring me peace.
5900,"It has been that way forever, regardless of medication."
5901,BP2 on various meds.
5902,My medication is making me just as depressed without them because of this excessive weight gain/bloating/water retention.
5903,"I haven't had any kind of anxiety medication prescriptions in a couple years now, and I'm wondering if I should call my new doctor."
5904,Will I seem like I'm just seeking medication?
5905,"Depression




My veins try to pull away

They’re afraid of all the bites

My mind is just gone some days

My eyes are sleepless through the nights

The echoes of my childhood

Still ring through my heartstrings

But I never, ever understood

The sadness that it brings

The melting air around me

Seems destined for my breath

It collapses, then breaks soothing

Siren calls to my death

The moon swells blood beneath my skin

A pitch black hurricane of cells

The reverberations of my sins

Mingle with the brimstone smell


The forked tongue of destiny

Lays curled around my head

I claw my eyes maniacally

While being swallowed by my bed

My teeth are grinding to a halt

Paranoia becomes my mistress

The way a wound embraces salt

The way lovers embrace madness

I can’t calculate the twisting thoughts

They lead my mind astray

This symphony of ropes made taut

Lets bleeding hearts decay

My fascination ending

Between the jagged teeth of life

Where dusk and darling morning

Drain to killers in the night


I hold my heart with purpose

And crush the fragile little charm

The devil’s grim, melodic kiss

Flows politely down my arm

I break the mirror’s rendition

Of a boy with sad, dead eyes

Exchange the room for ammunition

To inject the lows into the highs

Now falling, falling fast my legs

Begin to splinter into dust

The lipstick of the devil begs

My soul to readjust

The tiles pressed against my face

Barely any life remains

The reaper occupies my space

And pulls away my veins


Mania




The thunder thrashes my brain to mush

My madness breaks into a grin

I see the world, a lazy hush

And my entire mind begins to spin

I’m falling through the darkest soldiers

Carrying a torch that’s far too bright

The sun is on my very shoulders

And it streaks a brilliance through the night

That siren’s back, this time she’s screaming

For me to stay so far away

She splits apart my gentle dreaming

With vicious talons on display

The thoughts inside my head are sprinting

They’ve no intention of halting soon

The softest sound, a puzzle hinting

Leads me easily, for I tend to swoon


And this method lives inside the farce

It sings and leads me through the sights

I scream along, my voice grows hoarse

The wrongs, they melt into the rights

I’m smiling now, it’s growling faster

My gallant ideas on parade

I stretch them along the ceiling plaster

And cry “only heroes never fade!”

But this method, it lives quite dangerously

Tiptoeing between the traps and bites

When the sadness has no faith in me

It swan dives from the greatest heights

I’m swearing this, my heart is growing

It pumps the logic through my breath

Even now, it’s overflowing

But I’d truly love to drown to death


Her blisters break again, I’ve heard

She snakes her way up through my veins

But at this point, my vision’s blurred

A rabid dog fights with his chains

The medicine, it fights to slow my pace

But it takes far too long to work

Emotions crawl throughout my face

Until I finally go berserk

I’m laughing now, it’s bellowing

I’m shaking mountains to the floor

The meds, they set to mellowing

But I don’t want them to anymore

My heart’s now leaping, shrieking fast

The shift is now full in my soul

I spring right through the looking glass

And dive down the rabbit hole"
5906,I imagine a lot of us have to deal with side effects from meds.

5909,"As of right now, from what her mother has told me...she is in a manic state, experiencing psychosis..she isn't harming herself, yet from what I understand, she must either take her meds again...or be institutionalized because she would not be capable of handling her basic needs."
5910,I've been on medication for Bipolar disorder for almost 5 years now.

5913,Am I building a tolerance to the meds?
5914,I think my meds wore off last night and I ranted on the phone with my friend and then my mom for almost 2 hours because I was so angry I keep having to wait for treatment while I'm struggling in school just to pass my classes.
5915,I'm struggling socially and it's a chore to convince myself to take meds every day.
5916,"There is so much more going on and to make matters worse, I just switched medications a few months ago."
5917,"However, my regular pdoc told the hospital it was the most effective medicine I've ever been on."
5918,"I need to vent, so this might be kind of long, but I'm not really expecting anyone to read it :/

I've been diagnosed bipolar for over 6 years now, and I've been on medication for just as long."
5919,They never ask me how I'm doing with my medications or how I'm feeling.
5920,I am currently not taking medication or going to therapy.
5921,"No meds though, as I was very concerned about my extensive history with substance abuse."
5922,"Recently I've been back to my phych and finally got a REAL diagnosis and legitimate science on meds because my last psych didn't think it pertinent to even reveal his ""diagnosis""."
5923,"Once I more or less recovered from that a month later, I foolishly lapsed on taking my meds, and my mood got more erratic, but so gradually I didn't notice."
5924,"I started taking the meds again, but, as is the experience of many of us when we start our meds again, I had one really big episode last week."
5925,"I feel like I'm fighting to a) be seen as least tentatively as BP2, since that's what I had two diagnoses of before, and b) be given the medication I was recommended last."
5926,My psychiatrist put me on a low dose because I have a tendency to react poorly to meds.
5927,"I'm going off my meds (lithium and depakote) with the supervision of my doc; I'm trying to get pregnant soon and we're aiming to take me off these 2 completely, then supplement with safer things."

5931,"I didn't really think much of it until I got older, when I eventually went to therapy in my late teens/early 20s and took some medication for depression."

5933,"My question is, would a couple of days without medication hurt much."
5934,How soon were you put on meds?
5935,I'm really tired and I am ready to get on medications.
5936,"After that we plan to travel a lot internationally, so any advice on obtaining medication both nationally and internationally without insurance would be much appreciated."
5937,"Right now I'm taking 150mg of Lamictal a day and still increasing the dose, I'll probably be able to lower my dose in 6 or 8 months as my therapy really starts being effective and I get better at managing myself, but I don't realistically see myself being functional off medication, or on a lesser, I guess ""upkeep"" medication (for lack of proper vocabulary) for a number of years."
5938,"That leaves the question, how can I get my medication in an affordable manner both intra-state (in the US) and internationally (for trips out of the US, around 90 days per trip)?"
5939,"And honestly idk what all medicine is supposed to do, is it supposed to fix all these crazy feelings and thoughts?"
5940,"And the worst thing is, this is how he was (still is) even *with* medications."
5941,I tried to write it off as a fluke and weaned myself off of the medication and moved to another state and took another job.
5942,I wound up in hospital after hospital and have tried medication after medication and still I can barely function at all.
5943,The meds help but only seem to delay the inevitable.
5944,When I first took the medicine it felt like a mild hypomanic episode and I was able to wake up early and didn't even think about binging.
5945,Maybe I just willed my way into thinking this medicine would help.
5946,"I have been on these medications for nearly two weeks, and I didn't feel terrible for an entire week-- no suicide ideations or anything like that until a bad fight with someone today ended in that."
5947,I'm not sure if it can be attributed to the medication or if I have some sort of injury I didn't know about.

5950,"- help me get that awesome sleep back, or do I really need to consider increasing my meds?"
5951,"I have been on a lot of different meds and not tolerated any above the smallest possible dose (especially antipsychotics), but I have just been put on Depakote and have gone up to 500mg yesterday."
5952,"But, and as embarrassing as this is to admit, I have a few side effects such as diarrhoea since I've upped the dose (I know it's early, but it's what meds do to me as I have a history of stomach problems and IBS)."
5953,"I am very unimpressed with the psychiatrist, though, because I feel like he peppered me with questions for 20 mins, shoved a bunch of meds in my face, then charged me $300 for it."
5954,Is this round of meds normal?
5955,"got dressed, walked over to the electricity department to pay my bill, drove my mom out to a sick relative’s place, had a nice long chat with a cousin I actually look forward to meeting, stopped at a pharmacy for my mom to pick up my dad’s and my medicine, pulled in at the pump to fill in the gas—and then headed back home—it was sheer joy to be doing all this again!"
5956,"I know you’re not supposed to self medicate, but the medicine’s the same that the doctor was prescribing when I was going to one, and I’m going to insist that my new doctor change the dosage of the medicine cos—shit, 25 mgs of ZOLSERT was doing peanuts for me, and I’m feeling like I’m in heaven right now!"
5957,Various medications to help treat the disorder?
5958,My meds were(are?)
5959,"Unfortunately his stepdad, in addition to knowing this, also knows I checked myself in to the hospital for bipolar not responding to medication in the beginning of June."
5960,"I'm naturally out of pain medication, but for once it's not my own fucking fault - my parents were feeding them to me like candy when I was still too fucked up post-op to know what was happening."
5961,So I have been off meds about 2 weeks now and it is such a struggle but I know that I am doing it for good reasons.
5962,"Edit: I should have put this on here, I am going off my meds with a doctor's help and therapy."
5963,I've been at my wits end and out of my mind and cycling like crazy for as long as I can remember an for the last year and a half I've been trying to get myself to the doctor for these meds.

5967,Maybe the meds are working and I simply forgot what It was to be sick.

5972,Just stay positive be happy (: You don't need medication.
5973,The drug companies just want you to take medication.
5974,"** 

* Did your life change a lot when you started taking medication?"
5975,* Do you notice that the effect of your medication wears of during the day and that you get more hyper/depressed towards the end of the day?
5976,"I'm really low right now and I keep having repetitive thoughts that I've just had everyone fooled...I'm not really bipolar, I'm just a really shitty person and that's why my meds don't help."
5977,"Still feeling weird from my missed meds, sitting at my desk and her sitting by my side."

6024,(newer meds).
6025,I'm deciding to go off all medication.
6026,So I'll taper off my medication first and I think I'll go from there.

6033,I need to know if any of you have any advice on alternate methods of therapy that doesn't include medication.
6034,I'm good about taking my medications and my psychologist and psychiatrist just banned me from pulling all nighters because last week it threw me into a bad hypomanic episode.
6035,"It seems hypomania from lack of sleep now brings hallucinations even with medication :(

Anyways, here's my... concern?"

6037,She is in counseling twice a week and weekly appointments with a psychiatrist to monitor her medication.
6038,Argggh weight gain &gt;.&lt; That's why we're trying the newer medications that don't have that side effect.
6039,I've already been diagnosed with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and OCD from a psychiatrist I was seeing but I was told I wasn't responding to medication as someone should and that she might put me on a mood stabilizer (she didn't say why she thought that would be effective as we didn't get a whole lot into at that point).
6040,"Sometimes it's not a big deal, sometimes it's much worse

One day I this past weekend, I took my meds without food and was useless for the entire day."
6041,Learned my lesson and have taken medication with food since.
6042,"Hello there, I have Bipolar type two, I've been dealing with it for the last several years, I see a counselor, take my medication religiously, and try to exercise to keep balanced, for the most part that works for me."
6043,I know going back on medication would mean not using psychedelics for awhile and that combined with not believing I'll quickly (if ever) find a medication that offers some relief makes me really hesitant to speak with another psychiatrist.
6044,"My memory is still foggy from medications, and I just...I don't know."
6045,"* 

And I'm dealing with all this in the midst of a terrible episode, with slow dose changes of meds and little to no hope on a daily basis."
6046,I pulled an all-nighter to finish a paper for college last night and skipped the meds.
6047,EDIT: I just took my meds - the night following the day I wrote this - going to sleep.
6048,In my personal experience medication simply makes my life easier.
6049,My medicine has me cognitively disabled.
6050,That's farther from the truth but I don't want them to know I am in the middle of a medication change so that's why I been spacey.
6051,"With the combination of meds I take I'm almost never suicidal, and I've only had one truly manic phase since starting, but I'm almost emotionally dead."
6052,I guess I felt more balanced then...but it feels so freeing to not be on meds right now.
6053,So most medications for bipolar are completely out of the question for me because I refuse to gain any weight that I can't easily lose.
6054,I've been off my meds for a year.
6055,The meds that I WAS on made me feel apathetic and interfered with my sex life.

6060,"After 10 different medications, I stopped searching for something that worked for me."
6061,"I'm well aware that one day can screw things up, and I'm willing to get back on medication if other people feel that to be the best course of action, but my friends and spouse have said that right now, I'm better off of them than on."
6062,"My parents had always told me that there was something that could be fixed, that medicine would make me feel better, have more control over my anger and outbursts and meltdowns."
6063,I'm sick of medication.
6064,"I've been hospitalized 9 times this year, yes, but I've been off my meds since November 19th and I feel fine."
6065,"No one will know the difference, even my parents that monitor my medication."
6066,"You're stuck with hand holding and medicine that turns you into a fat, ugly, stupid drooling mess for the rest of your life."
6067,I do NOT recommend ANYONE to abruptly quit their medication!
6068,"Anyway, fast forward to 2013; I abruptly quit my meds without my telling my doc."
6069,I did it because I doubted my diagnosis and thought my symptoms wouldn't come back if I went off the meds.
6070,Has anyone else quit their meds abruptly and stayed off for a long time without anything happening mood-wise?
6071,"I needed the food assistance, access to free medications, psychiatric care, dental, eye etc."
6072,"I've only been on medication for one year, and that was when I was 23."
6073,Managed ok for ten years with zero meds than in 2000 I had a break down again requiring hospitalization and stabilization.
6074,"Hey guys, 

So after a year and a half of being off my medicine and not seeing a doctor."
6075,I finally got a job after a year of being unemployed and I want to try and keep this job so I thought maybe I should get back on meds.
6076,"He is unmedicated at the moment, and hasn't taken medication since he was a teenager (and it was forced on him, with a bad doctor then.)"
6077,I'm diagnosed bipolar I. I've been on medication which helped.
6078,"Off medication, I can be great at it."
6079,"On medication, I don't know why I even bother."
6080,"I don't care what lies they want to tell people to make them take their meds, bipolar and creative art are attached at the hip."
6081,"I don't know if I'm making any sense, but I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences about creativity and medication."
6082,I've refused all treatment and medication since then and have been ok.
6083,"Roommate problems (and trying to get the person evicted), summer school teacher having a stick stuck up somewhere, apartment utility problems, fight with the ex, missed one day of meds in there so add it all up and I'm going through a worse down swing than I have in months

On top of that add a fight with the current boyfriend."
6084,"Back to the subject, I just have not been right for 2+ years, sometimes i think/know that it wasn't a manic episode but just a good old fashioned psychotic breakdown ( i was abusing a substance that had terrible interactions with one of my meds)."
6085,Then friend suggested maybe its side effects of your meds?
6086,It is then I realized that I hadn't taken the meds.
6087,Was it due to the delay in meds?
6088,"For the past month or so, I've bounced from doctor to doctor, trying to get to a psychiatrist so I can talk about my symptoms and discuss some different meds."
6089,I have two weeks of medication left.
6090,"I'm not sure if I should call back the last office I visited and ask to be referred somewhere else, or just go off my meds for six weeks because I hate these phone calls so much."
6091,I hate that I have proved to myself again that it is euphie_x who is the weakest link - now medication and psychs have been accounted for.
6092,"I'm not even talking about imminent medication changes or hospital stays, I'm not even talking about wanting to move to another state, I'm not even talking about romantic relationships."
6093,"My SO wants to get off her pills and shift over to traditional chinese medicine and acupuncture because she thinks ""western medicine"" has failed her and will never ever work for her."
6094,"Not on medication, trying to regulate on my own."
6095,Is my medication wrong (or my fucking doctor)?
6096,I haven't taken my medicine in two days and know deep down I'm hoping I'll get manic.
6097,edit: just took my medicine.
6098,"Anxiety's been wonderfully relieved for the most part by my medications, but past few months depression has been hitting hard 2-3 nights a week."
6099,It does not say anything about it in the information that comes with the medication.
6100,"I know you are not doctors, but I'm just looking for people who have experience while on these medicines."
6101,I take all of my meds religiously and I never miss a day.
6102,I was hospitalized when I decided to kick my habit and I had a major manic episode that I can barely recollect but I spent a month in the hospital and since then I've been clean and taking my meds religiously.
6103,"It took until I was 20 to get stable on medication, during that time I graduated college, got a job, have had several promotions."
6104,"Over the past two months I have been in a bad spot, after what happened with the side effects and coming off geodon, I am terrified to try a new medication."
6105,Given that information she refuses to prescribe me anything besides the 2nd line medicines that do nothing.
6106,"So yeah I'm done, I'm calling my doctor to find another medication."
6107,I started medication and began to see a therapist regularly.
6108,I spent the past year (due to medications I think) under the impression I was doing better.
6109,I later came to the realization that everything was not fine towards the end of the semester and have been inconsistent with taking my medication (lamictal).
6110,Well he dipped out on me to move 2 hours away so today I'm going to meet my new pdoc in the same practice (he's the only other one there) and get back on my meds.
6111,I definitely need my meds.
6112,"it feels like everything is crashing down around me, I've been fighting against instability for a year now, life has been turned upside down, dropped, kicked, and put back together haphazardly and I'm starting to just lose it... mom's overworked, dad died, brothers have 0 respect for my feelings, I have more fingers on one hand than friends, ever building make up work, no insurance, no meds, and a fragile, fractured mind..."
6113,"I had an accident cutting too deep *labeled a suicide attempt * last year in July, stayed long term in a facility *3 months* while I got my meds and life straitened up, and haven't had any medicine since due to moving to California with my previously living father, him disowning me and having a bad trip on meth, sending all us kids back ""home""."
6114,"I have no access to medication, health care or someone to talk to, I feel so alone and so unhappy, I just want to see the light at the end of the tunnel but it feels like there isn't one."
6115,But I'm working on not self medicating so the meds have a real chance to actually work.
6116,"Last year I was diagnosed bipolar, before that I had just been diagnosed for depression and since being diagnosed, the meds have been a lot better help, but I'm having a really hard time."
6117,My sister is bipolar and has consistently gone off of her medications and frequents the psych ward.
6118,"I can't really go down there to check on her, and make sure she stays with her medications."
6119,"I guess what I'm asking is for any advice as to how to ask her if she is still on her meds and seeing her doctor without offending her, and if it comes to the point where she needs to be institutionalized again how to send her, since I am out of state and can't be there and if there are any resources for people living with bipolar disorder in Arizona to help her deal with being bipolar."
6120,"Prescribed meds, but not taking them."
6121,I went off my meds suddenly so it's my own fucking fault.
6122,"Long story short, I went off my meds."
6123,I have been off meds for about 5 months now.
6124,"Other than that, the medication is doing very very well for the depression ( on week 4 )."
6125,I don't take any other bipolar meds.
6126,It's like such a common trio but all the meds for each cancel each other out in a way.
6127,I can't seem to find anything that isn't too verbose or doesn't treat the patient like they're a child who has to be encouraged to take their meds.
6128,"My next meeting is in one week, and by then i'll be put on medication."
6129,"I'm not sure exactly what medication i'll recive, im just wondering what to expect in terms of side effects, addiction and how it will effect my life in general."
6130,Do any of you have this problem and do you have any tips that don't include medication?
6131,"(I say that, because I know medication can help it)."
6132,Been off my meds for close to a month.
6133,Living without meds isn't always easy.
6134,"I had a bit of a blow out with my boss and pretty much ruined any chance of going back..  My situation unfortunately is I'm living in Australia as a kiwi and am unable to claim any sort of monetary assistance while I'm unemployed, due to this I can't take time off work to begin taking meds and have been just going through the motions this entire time with no help."
6135,So 30 minutes later the wrestling match between your brain and the medication is over and victory belongs to the pill.
6136,"The reason I worry is by her 40s, my mom was out of control and had to go into assisted living, with all of her medication controlled."
6137,"I've gone through hell to get to this new psychiatrist, and after conveying a lot of my story and state of being, he didn't seem to think medication would help me much (i.e."
6138,My question is - have you been through this medication roulette and what worked best?
6139,"After consulting with her doc, he took her off all her medications immediately."
6140,"I supported and we collectively agreed that she should see another doctor, that maybe being off the meds was a bad thing."
6141,She went back on her one medication (lamictal) and stayed the off the rest per the OBGYN.
6142,"That maybe she was overly hormonal or there's a rebound from the other meds, but everything was amplified and making it hard for her."
6143,Who really thinks it's erratic behavior due to being off her medications.
6144,Now almost all of my meds are different and I'm cycling a couple times a day.
6145,"Figured it out, found the miss medicine, and started straight back to my 300mg dose after okaying with the pharmacy."
6146,which now I have meds for acute episodes.
6147,many meds just don't work for those lows.
6148,I don't know whether it is the medication or if I am just depressed.
6149,I got all my meds including Ativan but any other tips?
6150,"I've been diagnosed with dysthymia by a psychiatrist and have been given medication for it as well as for my ""mood disorder""."
6151,"Recently, this past month, I've stopped taking my meds."
6152,But things like what happened with my mother never happened when I was on meds.
6153,Before I was prescribed medication things were much much worse.
6154,"But I like to know that I am in control of my own fate, and that I can think so much straighter without the meds."
6155,"Though on the plus side I do have a good psychiatrist, am compliant with my medication, have good counselling and have been working through a disability employment service so it's not like it's something out of the blue."
6156,I finally began medication and once I was up to full dose I back-spiraled into my deepest depression and suicidal state ever.
6157,I need a very active and progressive program right now - a daily routine and a way to manage this until I can find the right medications.
6158,My doc upped me to 6mg again but said it might take a couple of days for the meds to take effect.
6159,"On a sidenote, are you guys who are bipolar one taking any anti-anxiety meds?"
6160,"Outside of that, how do you all deal with cold or flu while on meds?"
6161,I am going to see my doctor next week about adjusting my meds.
6162,"She gave away some of the stuff that was returnable (I suppose for the double rush of buying it and then to see them get it)  and now I am left scrambling for some money for very basic things like house hold bills, gasoline and her medicine / therapy."
6163,"- Besides medicine (which she's on and taking, but we haven't found the right mix) how can someone with bi-polar step themselves down from a compulsive spending manic episode

- What can I do to help protect our household beside locking her out of all accounts, and putting a credit watch on her so she doesn't open more?"
6164,"I would say since going on medication (a mood stabilizer and an atypical antipsychotic), I have been ""stable"" much more often than I have been severely depressed or manic, although my anxiety persists in all mood states."
6165,I'm working on it adjusted my meds and I'm doing better this week.
6166,"I'm going to continue my medicine as prescribed, valiantly giving up my status as a Sex God to benefit my mental well-being."
6167,If you have any recommendations for other meds I'd be happy to hear them.
6168,I have had a cold the past few days so I took some cold medicine yesterday.
6169,"I asked my doc about it today and he indicated that I should stay away from medicine with dextromethorphan since the meds increase the ""psychedelic"" effect of DXM."
6170,I feel like during the day my anxiety is very minimal - feels like the meds do their job.
6171,My therapist and I think maybe the gap in the night without any meds are causing early morning withdrawal symptoms?
6172,"I know I need to talk to my pdoc, and we're probably going to have to try adding another med (which both of us were hoping to avoid -- I'm already on trileptal,  seroquel,  and klonopin, and I've had bad reactions to several other meds we've tried over the last 4 years)..."
6173,I hate trying new meds :-\
6174,I like my meds I've got them right.
6175,I smoke at the end if the day and have either Passion flower tea or wild cherry bark tea when I take my meds.
6176,After the pregnancy she went back on the meds because she recognized she was high risk for post-partum depression.
6177,I have bipolar 1 and have been steady for years so my husband and I decided - with the assistance and approval of my provider - to go of all of my meds in order to try and get pregnant.
6178,"But this new doctor won't sign my papers untill he sees me tomorrow to see if the new meds are working (what psych meds really start totally working after 3 days,  I mean come on!"
6179,How in the hell did you keep yourself motivated AND medication compliant?
6180,"Leading up to the surgery my surgeon had me not take my meds 2 days leading up to the surgery (due to tests, etc)."
6181,The big mistake was not telling them of my other medicines I take daily for mood stabilizers.
6182,"But, the thing to do if you are a loner, such as me is before hand, clearly write out your medication schedule, including names and dosages."
6183,"I was on meds until 6 months ago when I stopped taking them, and I gradually got better to the point of not even feeling depressed (mostly due to cbt, i think)."
6184,I really don't want to go on medication again.
6185,"I go into my medicine cabinet, take the meds I need to, and realize ""Hey!"
6186,"I don't want to screw with my meds, but I'm having my doubts that this will go away this time."
6187,I'm going to talk to her about seeing my psych to increase my meds.
6188,"I'd kind of like your opinion on what you think about that whole situation and about my meds and how to approach my doctor when I don't want to actually CHANGE them, especially my antidepressant."
6189,"EDIT: TL;DR: 
Medicine: How do I approach my therapist and doctor about feeling like my meds aren't working, but stay adamant about not changing antidepressants?"
6190,Even after getting on meds and up until this day he is still somewhat of a... disagreeable fellow.
6191,I also was heavily pulled into drugs and risky sexual activity by other people with bipolar disorder and many encouraged me to go off my medications.
6192,"If this is all I can expect from the medication, then I have to assume I will never have the self esteem to try to find another job, or to take my business seriously."
6193,My meds will keep me stable to a point but sometimes I just cannot sleep.
6194,He takes medicine for it.
6195,"I used to never really want sour/sugary candy, but after starting my meds, I've noticed a definite (almost constant) craving for sour candy."
6196,Has anyone else experienced sugar cravings after starting meds?
6197,"I'm still a little lost on the details, but somewhere during in mania and being on the medicine the hospital gave him, his mom was trying to convince him to break up with me (b/c she thought it was my fault he was smoking), even though she claims that he was the one who wanted her to break up with me and she refused."
6198,"Anyway he and my mother divorced, to my understanding, because he ""made too much money"" and my mother couldn't get any help from the state for her medication, yet there was no way my dad could afford it."
6199,"She has a bunch of medicine she should be taking, but she just throws it up... because she isn't eating."
6200,"But, the good news is that there are medications, treatments and therapies that can help to reduce the symptoms and help you to cope with your condition."
6201,"Now that I stopped drinking and tried a cigarette, for a bit my anxiety and rumination went away, and I felt focused (I'm on psych meds don't worry, but sometimes mania is too strong for them)."
6202,When my meds get more sorted out I think I'll taper slowly off.
6203,"So, I have recently decided to find a new psychiatrist because I first met mine and got back on meds last July and since then I have seen her 3 or 4 times."
6204,"Well, the meds she had me on sent me into a deep deep depression to where I could not function."
6205,I don't want a new doctor trying to talk me into staying on these meds when they are effecting me like this.
6206,"Lectured me yesterday about quitting my doctor and meds, then sat on my computer for an hour looking up information about mental illness and local doctors."
6207,I'm wondering what medications have helped you all out.
6208,I had a bad experience with lithium in high school so I'm a little worried about the medicine but I just need to be on it.
6209,I don't have my next appointment (the one where I get the medicine) until february but I am on the cancellation list.
6210,I thought maybe I should go to the hospital but the therapist said that would stop when they got me on medicine.
6211,I'm so freaking tired and this stupid medicine should help me sleep but it doesn't.
6212,"I hate taking meds too, they just make me fucking blah, do not care, whole world is grey."
6213,"I was rushed off to the doctor yesterday, because my father was a bit scared, and we spoke to my psychiatrist, who said that one of my medications triggered a manic episode."
6214,"I have some medication from my psychiatrist and that's helping, but now I just feel flat and still quite... twitchy, I guess."
6215,They helped stabilize me on medicine and I felt pretty positive when I got out.
6216,"Basically, I had a medication adjustment."
6217,That's quiet a large change in medication.
6218,"During that time I've been on many medications, including stimulants (Concerta being the most recent) because I was also diagnosed with ADHD."
6219,"Almost three years ago (I'm 24 now), I stopped medication because I couldn't afford it."
6220,"To counter-act this and help me with my concentration, she (my doctor) has put me on Nuvigil until my insurance can get my Lamictal authorized and filled (pretty criminal withholding medication from someone with a documented history of mental illness, but that's for another thread)."
6221,I was also off my meds for about a year (lamictal 100 mg and saphris 20 mg) and i have to wait another week or so to get them from the manufacturer.
6222,Swing back down and realize that I haven't been taking my meds.
6223,"So yea, I have a long history of medications (mostly antidepressants) that make me feel worse."
6224,"If I ask for advice I know you guys will say find a doc, get counseling, take the meds ect."
6225,What medications have you taken and how did it effect you?
6226,I'm bipolar 2 and have been trying different meds but haven't found one that has an effect.
6227,I feel like I could do therapy twice a week and no meds and it could really allow me to solve my problems and then eventually in the far off future cut back on the therapy.
6228,Do any of you do no meds and only therapy?
6229,"I will start my meds in the next couple of weeks, I hope that they will ease the stress and pain of talking about something so traumatic so I can tell what the people close to me know and what the need to know."
6230,I've been having medication side effects of sleeping every night for 10-12 hours and abnormal sleep schedules and my pdoc says its the risperdal that's causing it.
6231,I'm also thinking of possibly switching meds as there's newer antipsychotics that supposedly have less side effects?
6232,"The medication works, but does not take away the extreme loathing and bitterness I hold against my existence."
6233,"The medication sustains me, but it only provides borrowed time."
6234,Has anyone here done pharmacogenetic testing to find out what medication might be right for you?
6235,It's basically a blood test designed to guide doctors on which medication they should prescribe you based on some liver enzymes.
6236,"Diagnosed in 1992, unmedicated after my second particularly bad reaction to medication in 1995 (medications=attempted suicide, every."
6237,Last Friday I had a follow up with my pdoc and reviewed meds.
6238,I can't start a new med today anyway as my gout is currently enraged and I'm taking all of the meds it requires.
6239,My medication (Lithium Carbonate) has side effects(Water retention and weight gain mostly) i can't deal with.
6240,I hate medicine.
6241,Can someone explain the mechanism by which the aforementioned meds cause weight gain?
6242,I haven't gained much weight but I'm noticing some over eating at night and I am worried it's related to meds.
6243,She also has been medicated for about 10 years and still hasn't found a medication that makes her episodes less severe.
6244,"I'm beginning to suspect that it has something to do with my meds, does anyone here have some light to shed on this, I'm beginning to get kind of frustrated."
6245,"I think its a bit harsh to say ""she was bipolar so you know she was fucking crazy"" or ""without meds she was nuts"" and I've been confronted with these topics a lot."
6246,"I guess I felt the edges of it last week, but now, even with my medication I can't seem to stop."
6247,The doctor in rehab diagnosed me with Bipolar and put me on good meds that stabilized my mood.
6248,"Wikipedia is a terrible source for information regarding most meds, often with info that flat out isn't true.."
6249,If you have had any experience with any of these meds and care to share any input would be appreciated.
6250,I was in the midst of an extreme manic episode (now controlled better with meds) and sex drive just extremely high and basically begged.
6251,"I was a ADHD kid, started stimulants around 9, antidepressants around 13, anti anxiety meds at 15/16, and bipolar 2 mood stabilizers somewhere between 17 and 18."
6252,"My doctors were trying to find the right mixture of medications, my family was trying to get me into some programs/services, and I was trying to kill my self."
6253,"Then recently, my meds, the meds I've been on for YEARS, started making me throw up."
6254,"With food, without food, pepto or no, I couldn't take my meds."
6255,"She started me on a new medication, and stopped the old ones."
6256,"I just want my old meds, my old life, my old everything back."
6257,I think money--not the welfare of the individuals on the medication--is the driving force behind bipolar treatment.
6258,"I don't really know what I'm getting at right now, I'm in a mixed state and not functioning the best, but is anyone else as disillusioned with medication as I am?"
6259,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not against medication, I just don't trust the industry and sometimes I feel like a guinae pig."
6260,"There are, of course, people of indigenous tribes who still celebrate what Western medicine has deemed ""illness."""
6261,They tell (read: command) me that I will need medicine for the rest of my life.
6262,That my medications may cause diabetes.
6263,As high as 50% if I go off my medications.
6264,"That I need to be placated with medication like a pig going to slaughter (this is how they discovered lithium, after all, and its ""effectiveness"" in managing those with mental illness)."
6265,I don't want to have to keep taking sleep meds to fall asleep.
6266,Last summer I was on a medication that fucked up my already fucked up cycles and I ended up in a psych ward by October instead of going into my usual non-stop 3-4 month happy fun summer hypomanic party.
6267,I think my brain is finally sorting its shit out with the help of intense therapy and multiple medications.
6268,But I've been on the same dose of meds with no adjustments for about 3 months now and I feel so much better.
6269,i guess im not going to drink anymore if im on meds.
6270,I really want to go get a proper diagnosis and be on a medication/therapy treatment.
6271,"2) Did you have memory problems before you stared medication OR if you are not currently taking medication, do you have memory problems?"
6272,"4) Have you noticed you've started to have memory problems OR has your memory problems gotten worse since you started taking a medication other than lamictal AND if comfortable, would you tell us what medication?"
6273,I started on some meds but quickly quit them and stopped seeing those doctors.
6274,I started cycling through medication again when I was 24 and got on the medication I am currently on in August (I am 26).
6275,"So, I've been waiting for insurance sign ups to hit so I can get coverage and start therapy/meds for 2015."
6276,"As tempting as it is to go off them, stay strong and stay on those meds!"
6277,"Hopefully we can get over the shame or hurt of our past mania, find meds that work, connections to people that love us, and true happiness and peace."
6278,"He says there are meds we can add on to help the shakiness, but I also don't want to add on more meds."
6279,Does anyone have any non-medication suggestions for helping it?
6280,How long did it take for you to start feeling the benefits of the meds again?
6281,My New Year's resolution is to pursue medication.
6282,"I decided not to pass this shit on to a child so I never got the family I so longed for, I can't just take off and travel without mapping out time zones, a months worth of medication, and my psychiatrist on speed dial, the list goes on."
6283,"I forgot I had been previously diagnosed eight years ago with ""bipolar disorder not otherwise specified"" I forgot because I never was treated for bipolar, other than being given medications while being an inpatient once."
6284,"Here is the problem............
 My moods keep fluctuating after running the gantlet of medication cocktails, I'm currently on 25 mg of zolof, 300 mg of welbutrin and 100 mg of lamictal and regular use of coping strategies learned in therapy ."
6285,"I  just wish could  be happy and healthy and off the medications and be able to drink with friends without any consequences to my mental health or in other words be normal, but sometimes we have to make sacrifices as I'm starting to learn."
6286,A few weeks ago my pdoc asked me if I wouldn't mind having a gene test to see which meds would be most and least effective.
6287,"Me and my husband have been wanting to have a child, and because Lithium is not a good medication to be on during pregnancy I sought out advice from my psychiatrist."
6288,"Lithium can cause heart defects in a fetus, and because the fetus develops all its organs in the 1st trimester he told me to avoid taking it 2 weeks before to trying to conceive until the end of the 1st trimester, and if I felt able to go without it longer I should as to minimize the exposure to the medication."
6289,"I don't doubt that my psychiatrist knows what he's doing, and as excited as I am to start trying for a baby of course I'm a little nervous going off my medication after 4 years."
6290,Going off medication because of pregnancy or as advised by your doc/psych?
6291,"I finally got transferred to a psychiatric facility after a weekend in the emergency room, but not before the hospital gave all my belongings away to another patient who they described as ""not all there"" and who proceeded to toss my wallet, keys and all my medications."
6292,I've been through five medications.
6293,"I've been on the last two for a month now and it doesn't seem to be working, so it's starting to worry me if I'll ever find a medication that would work."
6294,How long did it take you to find the medication that worked?
6295,I'm honestly having a really hard time with the subject of meds.
6296,"- also, meds don't seem to completely fix bipolar."
6297,Does anyone feel like talking through the meds they take and which ones do which specific things?
6298,Like many people I laughed at the thought of meds until I almost died.. yada yada we know the drill.
6299,"But the things I could definitely relate to were:

1)when he said he didn't want to take his medication because it made him foggy."
6300,I'm sure all of you know what it's like to try and get the right combination of meds but I feel like it's getting closer.
6301,"A note on my meds, I missed like 4 days and just started taking them (200mg) again, and have been on it for 8ish months with no real problem."
6302,The meds I'm taking must be amazing and working because I no longer rapid cycle.
6303,"I stopped taking my medication and every time depression tries to get me, I beat it looking at nature."
6304,"I've heard nothing but horrible things about psychiatric meds, but I can't keep letting my stupid ideas get me in trouble."
6305,I worked it out without any medicine.
6306,Then my doctor will check me to see if the medicine work or he will ask me to visit a  Psychiatrist to check me up.
6307,"To make a long story short, I've been taking a lot of sick days at work (which have all been documented with doctor's notes except for one instance where my boyfriend got heat stroke and I had to take care of him) due to reactions to medications, last minute appointments etc etc.."
6308,"They gave me meds for schizo but I was never diagnosed with anything and still am not, basically my family just wanted to forget about it."
6309,He's taking his medications and he can work on the land a few hours a day.
6310,I'm very hyper-sexual when I've been off my meds.
6311,I'm on medication and see my dr in a while so I will update everyone.
6312,I'm using psuedo ephedrin filled decongestants as a kind of self medication.
6313,I have medicine for that but then I am told I seem out of it.
6314,"I've been taking the meds like a good patient, I've been going to the sessions like a good patient."
6315,"Fuck, I've even been putting up with the psych nurse for meds, even though I can't stand the sanctimonious, patronizing bitch."
6316,The medicine did it's damn job for once.
6317,"sound depressed and i told him i thought i was feeling a little manic-y last week when i mixed up my medicines on accident a bit, but i thought it'd just wear off."
6318,"I wrote recently that I had gone off my medication (lithium/antidepressants), and attacked a boyfriend who I was very much in love with."
6319,"I have a question for other's who have had experience with taking this medication, **have you had any negative experiences in relation to drinking alcohol while taking the therapeutic dosage?"
6320,"** I've read that you shouldn't drink any alcohol while taking the medication, but I've also been told (and have read) that it shouldn't have any negative impact."
6321,I was recently diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and was placed on 2 medications to help with the bipolar and 1 for anxiety.
6322,After telling my doc about this...he is placing me on a 3rd medication.
6323,I've tried many meds before getting the right ones.
6324,I'm finally on the right meds which is great but recently I had a manic episode and unfortunately did something bad.
6325,Since I did any medications/drugs.
6326,"I'm miserable without meds, I hate life, I hate seeing people, waking up."
6327,"As I previously posted, I've been off meds for a few months, went to a new Dr yesterday and have my list of pills to take."
6328,I'm not sure I want to take medication if it robs me of some things.
6329,"I've seen some studies that say have this diet, and others just take medicine."
6330,"Not making excuses or anything but at the time I was using meth it would help me concentrate being that I am ADHD boy oh boy was I wrong, meth doesn't substitute all to well for ADHD meds."
6331,It wasn't a problem back then Doc put me on some great meds.
6332,Well the meds were working great.
6333,"It was at this point I realized, my medication stopped working."
6334,"I figured if the medication didn't work, what was the point of taking it?"
6335,So that's when I weened off my medication.
6336,I'll be able to get free medication but I will only see a doctor once every 3 months.
6337,I'm very worried right now because it took me something like 6 years to find the right kind of medication that actually worked well.
6338,"I'm treatment resistant (tried every medicine you can think of almost, to no avail)."
6339,"I was officially diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder just a few weeks ago, but unofficially diagnosed with it about six months ago (I was going to a counselor here at my college and they don't diagnose, but they told me many of my behaviors I described pointed towards Bipolar I Disorder, and so prescribed me medication having to do with that)."
6340,I'm not looking for advice as much as I just need to get this little thing off my chest and since I don't see a doc anymore and haven't been on meds in some time.
6341,Anyone been on this medication?
6342,And then taking a medication to make it go away only to become manic?
6343,I was taking depression medication a year prior.
6344,Off meds for a couple of weeks now.
6345,"Taking meds help some people, but in others it doesn’t help at all."
6346,"Some meds will work with these people, but not these other people."
6347,"She has major depression and is on medication, so we have a really good heart to heart."
6348,"So tomorrow, I am calling a psychiatrist to get started on medication."
6349,I can feel the medication starting to work.
6350,"Instead of telling me to get off the medicine, he told me to increase it!"
6351,"He's currently got me on a couple of different medications: Effexor, Trazadone, and Adderall."
6352,Finally in my mid 20's I got on depression meds.
6353,I eventually just quit all meds and used alcohol as a mask.
6354,Then I was just depressed and anxious..then just ADHD -- each time with a different medication that just left me feeling the side effects but not the effect I should.
6355,"They mostly do mail order (they will mail all your meds for free anywhere in the US), While they are in a very progressive area (Hell they are attached to one of the largest LGBT health centers in the US!"
6356,I Came back from the bathroom and the manager had my meds waiting for me... for $26.
6357,She gave me the meds that cost the $275 for 1/10th of the price.
6358,"Even if I don't keep my Seroquel over there, I will keep my regular meds there, they can afford the meds because of other uninsured people filling their meds there, plus they are sweet, and one of the few pharmacies I don't get dirty looks at for my hormones."
6359,"He is off medication and although I know it isn't a cure all, it isn't fair to my mother, brother or I for him not to seek help."
6360,I need meds...
6361,I don't know if that will be possible with the medication I will probably be put on.
6362,Anyway they diagnosed him and gave him meds.
6363,"He is 23, is so smart, has his whole life, and he's fucked it, because he stopped taking his medication."
6364,"Sorry about the bad writing I'm normally pretty good but I'm so worked up and tired and don't have anyone to talk to, but I just want to write this in the hopes that someone with bipolar might RECONSIDER stopping their medication without any help from their dr first."
6365,Unless he stays on his meds for good.
6366,Until I return for the next semester I can't start any sort of medication or treatment because they define it as a long-term problem.
6367,"I don't know what to do, and I know no one can help me, at least not till my pdoc starts prescribing me medication."
6368,My meds for my back should help me sleep.
6369,I've had symptoms of bipolar long as I remember finally got diagnosed near the end of college and some meds.
6370,Despite my meds and therapy my psychiatrist wants to increase my dose since I'm still not fully realizing my goals despite all my attempts I get crushed by anxiety.
6371,"This really, really surprised me, I suspected I was 'normal' as I'd be with all the modern medicine tech."
6372,... and I've convinced myself that I'm cured and I don't need my meds.
6373,"Right now, I'm still taking my meds, but I'm asking myself why am I taking this?"
6374,3 months ago against all medical advice and medical history my doctor put me onto seroquel from me normal medication (valium 5mg) and it was a very low dose for me as last time i took seroquel i was put straight onto the 600mg dose split into 200mg 3 times daily now this time i has serous issues my heart rate resting went from 65 to 120 thats 120bpm resting if i walked to the other side of the room it shot to 180 and walking from one end of the hospital to the other i blacked out 2 or 3 times at 194bpm i've had to have a few extended hospital stays and 3 days ago my doctor said he would stop the seroquel and i should expect extreme withdrawals from it.
6375,"but he put me on a 5x higher dose of my other medication (abilify 10mg 2x a day) my abilify is now up to 100mg at 50mg (2x10mg 1x30mg) 2x daily my other meds conflict with the abilify as well im currently on 

pristiq 150mg 2x daily 
valproate 1500 night 500 morning 
abilify 50mg morning 50mg night 
nexium 3 - 5 times daily 20mg 
valium as needed
sumatriptan (migraine prevention medication - as needed)
prochlorperazine 5mg 2x daily for vertigo 
doxycycline for skin issues
codeine/paracetamol 30/500 as needed for migrane's 
ferro-grad c for vitimain c replacement as my body does not seem to produce anywhere near enough 
testosterone boosters shots."
6376,the government system changes mean in the coming weeks i will see my medications go up and my medical payments go down.
6377,even medication is becoming hard to afford.
6378,everything is satellite based and extremely costly (100mb for 50 dollars) i can not for the life of me see any way to get out and the only doctor i can see sees me for 5 minutes tells me hes doing medication changes or nothing at all and kicks me out.
6379,"I'm worried about paying for my meds, and not being able to get/ afford therapy."
6380,"Most of the meds aren't that expensive (like, $20 max)."
6381,Right now I'm at the point where I've found the right meds (apart from the weird dreams they're the best I've found) and I feel genuinely positive about the future.
6382,"But it's getting hard

Having gained a lot of confidence after taking medication and steadily getting out mood swings, I'm starting to have trouble with anxiety again."
6383,Last week I had a three hour consultation with a bipolar medication specialist (a biological psychiatrist).
6384,The first thing we did was talk about my history of symptoms and what meds I've tried.
6385,"The meds that work best for me are lithium, haldol, and klonopin."
6386,"I also listed all of my vitamins, supplements, and meds with their dose."
6387,"Next, he brought out a [chart](http://imgur.com/DhMf9OZ) with potential medications."
6388,He explained how each class works in your brain (there are some pictures that I didn't upload where he sketched neurotransmitters) and suggested some medications for me based on my symptoms.
6389,"Finally, and most importantly, he wrote up a NINE POINT PLAN with nine different medication suggestions - mostly meds I had never heard of."
6390,I'm really optimistic about the medications he suggested.
6391,"I am not sharing them because this is highly individualized and I don't know if they would help you, but they are all listed in image 1 and I recommend sharing that image with your doctor if you want to make a medication change."
6392,The letter does cite sources for all of the medications (studies) which is also very helpful.
6393,If you are not feeling well you have a LOT of options and classes of medications which might help you.
6394,"If you feel like meds just don't work for you there is a strong possibility that you just have not been on the right meds, and I doubt you've tried all of the possibilities."
6395,Some medications also make other drugs work better.
6396,"Back in April I was hospitalized against my will and had a pretty harrowing experience in which my meds were repeatedly forgotten, I never got to talk to a social worker or therapist, I was terrified of my roommate, didn't sleep for three days, and in which the only other person I got to talking to was sexually assaulted during my time there and stopped talking altogether after the event."
6397,I'm constantly physically ill when I take medication.
6398,"For me, my medication made my episodes less severe, and they last much shorter."
6399,Is this normal when taking medication (atypical anti-psychotics)?
6400,Did anybody else become rapid cycling because of the meds?
6401,"i know my meds are helping because im aware of my mood changes and whats happening, but it doesnt make it any easier."
6402,"I can't take it anymore, the medications these doctors prescribed me just made it so I either gained weight, constantly was zoned out like a zombie, or they just flat out weren't helping."
6403,"I'm 17, I was diagnosed with type 2 bipolar disorder last year, and I've taken numerous amounts of medications, and I've even overdosed on one named seroquel and almost died in the ER."
6404,I thought that stopping the medications after a bit would maybe even be better than taking them (if I just coped with my disorder rather than pumping myself with meds every morning/night).
6405,"I would like it if I didn't have to take meds, but they don't seem to work well with me."
6406,I'm just so sick of switching meds and going into extreme mania while doing so.
6407,"How long was recovery and aside from stopping all medication that can cause either, is there anything else you can do?"
6408,"In a feeble attempt to stop some of the side-effects of the multitude of medications that come with our disorder, I'm attempting to ween myself off and go for a more ""natural approach""."
6409,Or does anyone think this is a horrible idea and that I should just stick to the medication?
6410,"[edit for update/clarification]: My symptoms weren't crippling before the medication, just more of an annoyance really."
6411,"He hasn't seen a therapist or psychiatrist in a while, and I'm not sure that he is consistently taking whatever medicine was prescribed to him."
6412,"I really want to change my meds, but within the past year I have already gone from a 2 to a 12 (symptom of my illness?"
6413,"), and I am afraid to get on medicine that will make me gain more."
6414,"Over the years I have been on so many medications that either made me tired, hollow, agitated, or had no effects at all."
6415,Does anyone have any medication success stories that didn't make them gain weight?
6416,So now I'm a month into these new meds and the last few nights they haven't been helping me sleep any.
6417,I have an appointment regarding my meds in a little over an hour.
6418,"I support her, I work full time, I pay for all of her doctor visits and her meds, I pay for all of her habits (weed and cigs), I drive her everywhere, I do all the shopping, all the cooking, all the cleaning, and honestly Im at my wits end."
6419,"She is working with her doctor to figure out a treatment plan, shes on 4 different meds at the moment and they aren't really helping."
6420,"She keeps saying to give it time and that the meds will balance out in a bit and she'll be back to normal, but I don't even know what normal is anymore."
6421,"I can take as many medications and up my doses as my doctor says, but nothing ever helps."
6422,"I have been taking my meds for a year and a half, but I have been thinking about doing it for the past two years."
6423,I was in a really great mood and decided to stop taking my meds and now I feel the effects of not being on them.
6424,I am currently in a mixed episode and cant tolerate more than 500mg of Epival because of an interaction with one of my pain meds.
6425,I have wrestled with the idea of going back on meds for years.
6426,Same with medication.
6427,"(there's more to this, can elaborate if you're interested, but alas it is not the point of this post)

So, I jsut started meds, we'll see how that goes."
6428,"If I still experience mood swings and no side effects, is it possible my medication is working but still just a low dose?"
6429,I'm afraid that they will want to put me on some medication and that there may be something further wrong with me than I thought.
6430,"Usually this is a sign that I'm either manic or about to go into one, but I haven't messed with meds at all and I'm very hyper selfaware of either getting manic or depressive."
6431,Maybe it's my meds?
6432,My first question/concern is about my medication.
6433,"I've been diagnosed with Bipolar I for several years now, on and off various medications for various reasons, and he's changed my meds at every visit."
6434,"So, I was manic and he gave me an anti- mania medication, then became depressed so he put me on an anti-depressant, but doesn't he understand that I'll likely be manic by my next visit?"
6435,"For people diagnosed with bipolar disorder, are there any medication you are or were on?"
6436,I asked my doctor when several other medications weren't working if he thought I was bipolar and at the time he said no.
6437,Not sure if it's the meds or my natural BP cycle but I have an appointment with my pdoc on Monday.
6438,"Because of this, I ran out of my meds a looooooooong time ago, beginning of the year and I've not had the money to even make a doctor's appointment or refill my medications."
6439,Can't loan from anybody because I have no idea when I'll be able to pay them back and appointments + medications = lots of $$$.
6440,I think about doing medication but I rather just do drugs I guess.
6441,from what I can tell medications just help u get by basically.
6442,"If I don't go back on meds, my only other option is hospitalization."
6443,I've been off of meds for 6 1/2 years (from conceiving and having my first and second child to now).
6444,You need to up your meds!
6445,"http://m.imgur.com/a/9oC0Z

I was diagnosed in August, and started medication in September."
6446,"I'm on medication and I see a therapist so I am in treatment, I'm just not sure what to make of these moods."
6447,"I have been dealing with Bipolar 1 for over 8 years now, and have never had medications that truly worked for me."
6448,"Most medications have no affect on me whatsoever, including more generic things like acetaminophen or caffeine, and the very few that do only affect me at a very high dosage level; these medications only feel like they take the edge off of the worst moods."
6449,"My most recent psychiatrist labeled this as ""medication resistance,"" before dropping me as a patient."
6450,I was crying and she offered me one of her anxiety meds.
6451,"I normally would never take someone elses medication, but I needed the attack to stop and my mom was really worried about me."
6452,And he upped my antidepressant and put me on another medicine.
6453,I asked what kind of medicine it was.
6454,"Reading the pamphlet:

""This medicine is an atypical antipsychotic...""
Under possible side effects:
""symptoms of high prolactin levels (eg, enlarged berast size, decreased sexual ability...'


That crap pisses me off."
6455,Has this happened to others when it comes to meds?
6456,I take my regular meds at night with 300mg Seroquel and 10 mg Seratonin.
6457,"I was on meds for decades and did no better on them, and even if i went and got them the second i felt my invincible self i throw them out cause i think i don't need them, ive done this many times, been hospitalized six or seven times, i am very very tired."
6458,"I can't take benzos, but I was wondering if anyone has any experience in taking something for the low moods that will help in addition to my other meds, but will not be habit forming."
6459,I am losing weight at a decent pace despite the meds.
6460,He helped me out with some more meds.
6461,"So how exactly do I tell him certain meds are working and others haven't been in my system long enough to know the results, if any?"
6462,Even with insurance right now my meds are about $30+ a month and around $100+ for 2 visits each to the psychiatrist and psychotherapist per month.
6463,"I've been reading through the subreddit to get an idea, but I'm just wondering what everyone's experience was when they were first diagnosed and how the beginning stages of treatment went--I hear it's no picnic adjusting to medication and I'm curious about what to expect."
6464,I've been put on meds for bipolar way before I met him.
6465,"Also, what meds have worked for those of you that have bipolar?"
6466,I keep getting my meds changed because I feel they aren't working.
6467,"I'm not currently on medication, trying a natural approach (which I guess isn't working?)."
6468,I know he'll get on meds(because he wasn't before)  I just don't know how to deal with all of this.
6469,No change in meds or living/working situation.
6470,I don't know if it's a side effect from medication but every time I'm at my boyfriend's house I randomly start crying for a bit.
6471,It ain't easy with the meds; but boy is it worth it.
6472,"My P-doc wasn't too concerned really; I mean, we were planning to reduce my medication to 0mg per day over the course of this year."
6473,I had lived for years with intense depression and had (mostly) successful experiences with medications.
6474,"In addition, the memory loss that I've had with my bipolar disorder and medication makes me embarassed in social situations since I don't remember his friends names or other things."
6475,Is it a stupid idea to ask my doctor for weight loss medicine?
6476,"I was diagnosed when I was 18 with major depressive disorder, took meds for a while (Prozac, colanzepan/m for anxiety, and Ambien for sleep) and unfortunately after a year had to stop because my parents got divorced and my dad decided not to pay for my health insurance so I was forced to stop taking the medication."
6477,"My team prepped me for release, gave me meds to last a week, and a prescription to last a month."
6478,"I  have a week and a half left of the meds and the bottles say ""refills require authorization""."
6479,"I don't want to stop my medications because they are working wonders, and I am worried that I will go back into severe suicidal behavior again even with the support I have."
6480,"I haven't changed my meds in three months and until the last couple of weeks, felt really stable."
6481,"Yesterday when attempting to enroll in a clinical trial for a depression medication, I was diagnosed with Bipolar II."
6482,I was promptly prescribed a medication and basically left without any guidance because the doctor that diagnosed me was too busy with the research aspect of doctoring to really give me a plan.
6483,All I was told was to get the medication and then seek help from my own doctor.
6484,"I want to prevent the recurrences of my depression, which often times has me feeling dangerously bad, so I know that taking this medication is worth it if it can prevent me from getting that low again."
6485,I'm scared taking the medication will make me less sure of myself.
6486,"I can't back out of my current decision to buy this house, not that I currently want to, but what if the medication brings out regret?"
6487,"Since then I've been a a slew of different meds, but always with Lamictol as a cushion of sorts, leveling me out enough that I didn't want to crawl into a black hole and never come out when I was depressed and kept me from going completely off the edge when I was manic, but it was never enough to just be on it alone."
6488,So I have experimented with other meds in conjunction with it to no avail.
6489,"90% of me is telling me to fuck this medicine and drop it right now, while the other, more logical, 10% is telling me to give it another week."
6490,"I was explaining his medication and the cousin who is 20 says, ""oh god, he's crazy too!"
6491,"It brings me up and I stay up even after I crash, I only use it when I really have to get something done or in the morning to combat the affects of the meds I take at night to get me going."
6492,"And then I said it was me, because she knows I tke sleeping medicine but she doesn't know it's seroquel xr."
6493,"While this medication puts me in bed for more hours than I'd like to spend there, I guess I'm starting to feel a little better."
6494,"I hope this medication will help me break the shackles of these roller coaster habits that freeze me in this never ending circle... My whole life is a succession of fails over fails over fails...

Anyways."
6495,Those are all medications for more manic bipolars.
6496,"Should I get a second opinion (May take awhile), or take the meds?"
6497,"I tried meds once, didn't like it."
6498,and i'm not on any meds :l
6499,"What has worked best for you in terms of meds, dbt/cbt skills, coping methods, etc?"
6500,"A little background: I've been diagnosed bipolar II for about a year now and have been medicated that long, but on different meds."
6501,"A few medications later, I am now taking Geodon, Lamictal, and Lithium."
6502,I just really want off of this medication if my psychiatrist thinks it will be okay.
6503,"Current meds:
300 Seroquil
900 Lithium ER
200 Lamictal
Q96
And every single vitamin on that sheet they give you"
6504,She's convinced she'll get better and therefore has chosen not to take any meds.
6505,"I've decided to give her the ultimatum of taking meds or im leaving her, i can't take it anymore."
6506,I'm scared that I'm not going to be able to go back to not being on meds.
6507,rapid cycling bipolar 2. i am not on any meds.
6508,i will call my doctor tomorrow (later) to talk about beginning with the meds.
6509,"My mom is not happy for me, and I've had to hide my medications from her because she thinks I'm on lithium."
6510,"When she's somber, she asks if I'm taking my meds, and I am."
6511,I had a weird freak out about my meds.
6512,But...It's been interesting...and I know I'm stupid for doing this and I'm realizing why I was on meds in the first place  (losing your absolute fucking shit over little things is not fun) but...I kinda like not being in this hazy bubble...
6513,This is the first full day I've been on the medication and I feel extremely down and depressed.
6514,What can I expect from this medicine and how long before it kicked in for you?
6515,I am just tired at throwing meds at this.
6516,He thinks if this new medicine works and once I am stable I can get off one of the antidepressants and the abilify.
6517,"Anyways, he sent me to a psychiatrist to get meds."
6518,"He told me that if I have manic tendencies, the meds will possibly trigger them."
6519,Keep taking meds and risk an episode?
6520,My dad is totally against medication.
6521,"TLDR; Rash, but meds work so well."
6522,"Id normally never agree to taking psych meds, Im skeptical."
6523,I have tried many medicines.
6524,I'll keep taking my meds like a good little dog and keep hoping that a jet engine falls on my room while I'm sleeping.
6525,"I'm on good meds that help my anxiety &amp; bipolar 2, but this work schedule is putting me back on the roller coaster."
6526,I finally upped my meds though I was scared too.
6527,Meds forever and if I truly get happy am I really happy or is it just because of these meds.
6528,"Despite the meds, I'm constantly agitated, often angry and always depressed."
6529,I had long ago come to terms with my bipolar diagnosis (was diagnosed about 15 years ago) and had a long battle consisting of a host of different meds and periods of going off meds because I hated the idea of not really being me.
6530,"Now, after being on meds for almost 5 years, I've gained it all back and then some."
6531,So I'm thinking of weaning myself off my medication.
6532,Tl;dr considering going off meds with or without a doctor after 5 years and a long road.
6533,She hasn't found the right mix of medicines yet and has quite a few ups and downs.
6534,All she really did was throw meds at us.Both of us struggled a lot initially.
6535,"The thing that is really difficult for me is that she hasn't been on meds for 3 years, only saw a psychologist for 6 months and leads a totally stable life."
6536,"I haven't needed medication for some time, and haven't been to an appointment in the same amount of time."
6537,"My only option before then is to see a nurse at the clinic I go to, and she likely won't be able to change any meds."
6538,"He is in denial and won't take medication, and I'm fine with this because I don't want to force him to take medication he doesn't need."
6539,"Hey guys, I've noticed a trend I've had and I'm wondering if it's a common theme to those of you also on meds."
6540,"I know I shouldn't drink much while on meds, buuuuut it's part of my lifestyle habits and it doesn't happen too often."
6541,I've only just realised it's kinda happened since I've been on meds and wondering if this happens to you guys?
6542,Is this the meds kicking in and killing a sort of high?
6543,Anyways my first follow up was canceled because I stopped the medicine he put me on and was goin to find a new doctor then I went to the hospital and was like to just move this faster I will stick with him for the mean time.
6544,He went off his meds 4 months ago.
6545,Didn’t lean on him hard to go back on his meds when he quit because I was holding onto the possibility that his 1st manic episode was a fluke caused by him staying awake for 4 days.
6546,I’m hoping the collective power of Reddit logic and advice will convince him to stay on his meds when he gets out.
6547,"I was having some negative side effects to my meds, so pdoc had me stop, I swung up, then down."
6548,I'm struck by how many posters seem to be suffering from Bipolar symptoms that seem unmitigated by medication.
6549,"Everything I read says that this is a highly treatable disorder, and that most people will lead relatively stable lives on the right medication."
6550,I have been diligent on my meds.
6551,I have been on SO many mixtures of medications over the last ten years.
6552,I have never heard of Latuda and I have tried around 15 different meds.
6553,"i was off meds for the whole year of 2012. after being on 5-6 different meds and then staying on celexa for a few years.. 20 mg, then upping to 40mg right before i got off of them."
6554,I NEVER take my meds anymore.
6555,"I was diagnosed bi-polar and ADHD in high school, but didn't really believe in medication and instead opted for natural changes and therapy which I suppose helped, but looking back I really just turned to recklessness, drugs and alcohol to ignore my problems..."
6556,"I'm paid so little it's looking like I won't be able to afford insurance that covers my meds/psychiatric care needs enough for me to afford them

So basically this is partially me venting and partially me asking for any input on how to handle this shit."
6557,Has anyone else here on this sub experienced something similar with their ADHD meds?
6558,I'm going to see a psychiatrist to get his opinion and start playing with meds.
6559,And dealing with the medications' side effects.
6560,The meds for me made things much worse for me and made me frankly dangerous.
6561,I also don't have insurance or money even if I wanted meds.
6562,"These meds are a new thing though, how did people survive with this?"
6563,The meds they gave me don't work.
6564,Currently working with two doctors to come up with a medication plan and determine if it is Bipolar I or II.
6565,My meds(Lamictal and Citropram) make me tired all the time.
6566,"Before I started medications, I honestly thought I might be a bit of a sociopath (psychopath?"
6567,I've heard that some of the meds can actually cause suicidal thoughts....I'm on a whole mess of them.
6568,It has been almost 3 weeks since I safely went off medication with my doctor watching the whole way and working very closely with my therapist.
6569,I have been cycling every couple of days so more than when I was on meds and some days all my energy goes into not wanting to scream at the ineptitude of the human race.
6570,"I can't believe I am going to work everyday, showering everyday (YES that is a big one), managing a relationship, and doing this all off my meds."
6571,I'm a month out of the hospital for a psychotic episode (second hospitalization in past several years) and settling into new meds (lamictal+abilify).
6572,"Last time it took months for this to go away, but I'm hoping the meds will be like magic awesome wonder drugs and work so quickly."
6573,"Bounced around from Lamotrigine and ambilify to finally being prescribed Lithium after my pleas of wanting to change medication because of my anxiousness, and it did wonders."
6574,"But by the time I look to make an appointment, I go back into a manic episode and I say how I don't need the medication."
6575,"They had me on all kinds of meds that didn't work, but eventually got me on the right ones."
6576,"Anyway, my question is: While I was either off my meds or on the wrong ones I sometimes felt like I was trapped in my own body."
6577,"My psych increased my medication; I'm currently on olanzapine, lamotrigine and aripreprazole, she also put me on sleeping pills because I'm awake most of the night because I'm terrified as I'm seeing things."
6578,That being said we do not want to stifle discussion however we really do want to emphasize the desire to keep this place safe and have the relevant documentation for alternative medications.
6579,I think my meds are working.
6580,"The medicine helped him remember some, not all, of the bizarre things he did (screaming at random strangers outside of his doc's office, stripping down to his underwear in front of his best friend's house, talking to the TV because a ""camera was installed"", etc)."
6581,"I don't wanna resort to calling the police, which I'd done in the past when he refused to take his meds."
6582,"Fast-forward a few years and I'm doing ok, I seem to have stabilized considerably, having explored many different combinations of medications, supplements, diet, employment/unemployment, exercise and other lifestyle changes I'm down to just tweaking the parameters a little but have found a good base and I'm pressing forward."
6583,Or are on meds that really help it?
6584,"Besides a blip with the meds, I've felt pretty even."
6585,Now I'm crashing and I don't know how far lower I will go but my question is this: Does the effect of medication weaken with time and I should get a higher dose or is it purely psychological?
6586,Then took a two hour nap - pain meds knock me out.
6587,"However, if I am staying over at a friend's place, I tend to forget my meds."
6588,"A couple days ago, I forgot to bring my meds, and I had a series of intense hallucinations."
6589,I normally forget them after taking my meds.
6590,"I'm off my meds, not because I feel like they're ineffective, or that I do better without them, but because I cannot afford them."
6591,I started seeing a new lady recently because I got pregnant and my psychiatrist took me off of all of my medications (and out of work!
6592,"Maybe that means something is wrong with my meds, or maybe this is how I'll have to live the rest of my life."
6593,"I went on to talk a little bit about what it was like to have delusions, and mentioned I would have a psychotic episode if I didn't take my medication."
6594,I have delusions and psychotic episodes when I'm not on meds.
6595,I'm taking my meds and realize I was in a 'weird' mood last night.
6596,"I'm very skeptical of meds, I was on them throughout my adolescence and now don't even take panadol."
6597,Do meds help with this at all?
6598,Name a medication and I've been on it.
6599,She was released after not too long and prescribed medication (don't know which).
6600,"However, she has since gone off the medication and has moved out of Julie's apartment (left the apartment about a month ago)."
6601,I was diagnosed with bipolar a little over a year ago but made the stupid choice to go off my meds in November.
6602,"Prior to good medication, about half of my hypo-manic episodes resulted in positive energy and creativity that let me get some pretty cool stuff done."
6603,"Ever since the meds though, when I do get hypo manic, it's just an elevated heartrate, jitteriness, and ADD that prevents me from getting anything done at work."
6604,"BP in college, meds, hospitalizations, etc.)."
6605,"Sometimes you get stuck in the mud, but you seem to have a clear sense with your meds that so long as you take them you can sort of see the mud coming and move away so you don't get stuck."
6606,"I take my medications, I get good sleep, I don't drink."
6607,"An atypical anxiety medication that has substantially decreased my base level of anxiety, plus!"
6608,She's currently off her medication after receiving kidney failure from the medication; she's expressed that she feels the relationship may be unfair to me until she's back on a medication.
6609,"So in that way the experience was kind of a blessing, it's a relief to finally have the correct treatment...but I spend a lot of time feeling embarrassed and crazy (even though I know neither is true), and also HATING being on medicine."
6610,"So basically, I already hate taking medicine."
6611,"Every time someone posts an article or I see a book or a documentary or whatever about how drugged up the country is, how dependent on prescription medicine, or I hear someone complain about it...it's harder."
6612,Yes of COURSE I want that--to not need/take any medication-- I'd do anything for that possibility.
6613,Then after a few months I stopped taking it because I'm shitty at taking medication and also it was a pain in the ass to go every month to the clinic.
6614,"In february I decided to go back on my meds and this time around though, it seemed to barely work for some reason."
6615,I have never been on any medication.
6616,She took my medication away.
6617,I have no medication.
6618,"I am supposed to follow up with the psychiatrist and a different psychologist in a few weeks, but I will only be able to say that I didn't take the meds because my mom thinks we should get a second opinion."
6619,"The day after I had my meds taken away I walked out of my calculus final, turning in blank pages."
6620,"The biggest thing I've noticed is that if I go out and drink a bunch of beers, I can't go home and take my medicine and go to sleep within half an hour, instead I'll hang out surfing the net and posting to facebook."
6621,He agreed and in a couple hours I'm calling my GP to try to get on some meds.
6622,I'm scared of what the medicines will do to me.
6623,"Who will ""I"" be on medication?"
6624,I am a wreck and I am not on medication.
6625,"It may very well be the 4 mgs of risperodal that I am on, but I have no way of telling whether it's meds or myself since the medications I believe can affect your sense of self."
6626,"I want her to be able to live happily, but when she is going on a medicine that could change her personality, what do I do?"
6627,The biggest downside is the weak nauseous feeling that comes along with this medication; it kind of makes me want to crawl out of my skin.
6628,"I'm not too fond of medication, but I take anti-psychotics, mood stabilizers, and anti-depressants."
6629,I was trying out a varied cocktail of meds for quite some time during a sensitive part of my life.
6630,i also have a problem remembering to take medication.
6631,I underwent a transition in my life (change is very tough on me) and I decided to kick the meds as i opened a new chapter in my life.
6632,"I'm not advocating ditching your meds, I would just like to offer a personal anecdote of how I was able to function (and prosper) without them."
6633,Well anyway sorry for the wall of text I take meds but my psychiatrist said that altering my meds won't change anything and that I need to do DBT therapy every week.
6634,"I can't afford my medication, the only thing that keeps me sane."
6635,"I'm sure it works fine for others but I'm in too deep at this juncture - I have taken my meds for long enough to where they're more than my crutches, they're my goddamn legs."
6636,"With meds I have gotten to a place where I feel it coming, go into the bathroom and just scream and cry."
6637,"For this reason it is critical that an accurate diagnosis is made without the patient's bias, because the wrong treatments and medicines can mask or exasperate the true mental health disorder."
6638,A woman with a crushed spirit after having been told each day by well-meaning doctors that she was severely ill and needed treatments and medications for the rest of her life.
6639,Let me be absolutely clear- the vast majority of drug sales are for medicines that better and save lives.
6640,A recent Google search to see if I can take any cold medicine revealed that those two together are kind of a big no-no.
6641,I'm just very intrigued by the fact that a licensed professional prescribed me medications with clinically significant drug interactions.
6642,He gets high 24/7 and drinks on his medication.
6643,"i've been on medication for a long time, many years, i'm a 24 year old male and i know it has effected me mostly negatively."
6644,"i'm worried that with some of the meds i was on, like antipsychotics, have permanently fucked up my brain, and ect has zapped away some part of me."
6645,I understand why people don't want to take their meds.
6646,On meds.
6647,Tried several medications but literally made me feel like a zombie.
6648,"While I tried several medication when I was insured, I am no longer insured and can barely afford a roof over my head."
6649,"I struggle with keeping myself normal as possible without medication or therapy, but I guess that people think that my mood and personality  are inconsistent no matter how hard I try to make it consistent."
6650,**Disclaimer:** *This isn't to discourage the use of medicine if it works for you.
6651,I am also not advocating any alternative medicine because I'm not claiming there is anything curative about managing without medication.
6652,"The only medicines that worked well for my mental state had awful physical side effects for me (No boners :[, intense weight gain, brain zaps, difficulty swallowing, sleeping all the time, etc)."
6653,"I have taken the difficult road and have been trying to manage without medication since I turned 18, 6 years ago."
6654,Generally I have been a much happier and more successful person since I stopped medications.
6655,She knows that I am diagnosed and that I choose to forego medications but I have not told her about this depressive state yet.
6656,"This hurts my pride so much, I am usually really good at managing my life without medications."
6657,"At least 4 times during this time, the person told me that they had in fact overdosed on their Lithium and other meds as well as alcohol."
6658,( essentially half my full weeks medication combination) I am still trying to scrub off the last of the tacky stuff from the heart monitor lead pads.
6659,"I've allowed myself one drink a week for the past couple weeks, but last week I slipped up and had 5 drinks in one night, and was hungover the next day (my meds make me drunk faster)."
6660,He's very resistant to medication and counseling and basically doing anything in this state so that's where I need advice.
6661,I'm scared that he'll have another bad experience with medication that'll make him into someone I can't recognize.
6662,I'm scared that he will refuse to take medication.
6663,"I'm scared that if he has to be on medication his whole life, he won't be who I've always known and loved."
6664,medication?
6665,"Any help would be great, it just seems like I'm constantly increasing my medication dosages in order to stay in the realm of sane because any little step out of routine makes me go flying..."
6666,"So, I've had ""issues"" since I was about 16, you know the usual: countless suicide attempts, risky stupid situations and behaviors, put on so many different medications and eventually diagnosed with bipolar."
6667,"when I was about 18-19 I decided I didn't want to be that person anymore and didn't want to take anymore medication so I learnt to fake ""mental-health""."
6668,Go to a GP and ask for meds?
6669,"You are staying hydrated, and does your medication make it difficult to retain fluids?"
6670,I've also been waiting for an appointment (for over 6 months) to get a med eval (have taken meds in the past) but when I got to the doc's office today they told me it was cancelled and that the EARLIEST i could see someone was on Nov. 11 making the appointment I've been waiting for even further away...
6671,"I'm taking medication, I'm in therapy, I've tried all those ""alternatives"" (that don't work)."
6672,Should I look for an outside psychiatrist for medication management or just use the school provided one?
6673,"Ever since I began my medication two years ago, I just feel like I am getting dumber by the second."
6674,"Before my medication, I used to be able to breeze through school with absolutely no struggles."
6675,"I'm just having a moment right now where I'm generally frustrated and upset about taking my meds, and I'm about one step away from just quitting."
6676,"I've been taking some kind of psychiatric meds for about seven years now, and I've only quit cold turkey once before."
6677,"She told me last year that she was depressed and had previously seen a doctor for it, but never taken any medication or anything, just therapy."
6678,"I was on academic probation this semester, and my meds  started to stop working."
6679,"I used this semester to work with my doc to fix my meds, and now that I'm starting to feel better I'm horrified by what this might have taken from me."
6680,I've been on risperidone for about a month and a half now and have noticed some super odd things which I can't be sure are related to the medication or just me coming down from hypomania and into depression.
6681,"Following my episode, I went through a 6 month depression where I tried a bunch of medications and it was a really trying experience."
6682,"I know people who have bipolar aren't supposed to take stimulants, but do you think there is a possible way to take them if other medications were adjusted to make sure bad things didn't happen?"
6683,These days also often produce a debilitating shoulder pain that no trigger point injection or medication has been able to relieve.
6684,"I take my light dose of prescribed prozac in the mornings, but after that I survey the medicine cabinet for something I always justify as something ""to get through the day."""
6685,It sucks to be so dependent on medication.
6686,"Maybe it's the meds, but I'm really happy that I possibly have an answer to why my life is always so fucked up."
6687,What makes things worse is that I was so out of it I missed both appointments with my psych team so I have to make the meds I have last.
6688,one positive note on current treatment would be that i think medication has helped me somewhat with my symptoms and i don;t think pharmaceutical companies and the mental health experts and system are **completely** evil or money hungry.
6689,I've recently contemplated to give up on meds altogether.
6690,One of my friends told me that I use bipolar as a crutch and that I'm too dependent on medication.
6691,He says that plenty of people live with bipolar without meds.
6692,I've been trying to get on the right combo of medication for about a year and a half and my doctor switches mine every so often because some don't go together or they just don't work for me.
6693,The insurance I got didn't cover one of my meds so I had to go without it for two weeks.
6694,On top of that my doctor changed one of my meds.
6695,"The things I've done so far: Told him every time I was in a manic or depressed episode, explained my history (job loss, hospitalization, etc), explained the medication I take, and offered to take him with me to my psychiatrist so that the doc could explain how serious this all was and that I'm not just a drama queen but that this a REAL illness that can really mess up my life if I don't control it."
6696,On top of that I want the doc to explain that finding the right combo of meds is not easy.
6697,You need to take meds and stuff like that to control it and even then I'm still going to have little episodes.
6698,"I was diagnosed bipolar 2 4 years ago and was on a shit load of medicine, have it more or less manageable to where I can function but freaking period rolls around and I turn into a mess, any tips?"
6699,"So, here I sit going a million miles an hour sitting here in the chair, still incredulous that I was actually SCOLDED for taking medication AS PRESCRIBED ON THE FUCKING BOTTLE THAT SHE FUCKING WROTE."
6700,looking back it makes so much sense the ADHD meds made super depressed and the depression meds made me want to kill myself just to get away from myself.
6701,"(Many people in my family have these disorders) I also have ADD and ADHD, and a medication called Cerequil XR coated my innards in poisonous guck and made me weak and thin when I was 13."
6702,She had an episode where she ODed on anxiety meds- that's what landed her in the hospital.
6703,"I'm entirely off of my meds, and have been for a month."
6704,"My husband keeps badgering me to just take my medicine because ""He's the one that has to deal with it,"" meaning my suicidal episodes and constant depression."
6705,"I can't afford any other medicine than what I was previously taking, and I'd rather be unmedicated than be that miserable again."
6706,"Now that I've laid down the meds and my family is having to deal with a little irritability from me and I'm managing hypomanic episodes (very carefully, mind you.)"
6707,They'd rather me be suicidal and on meds than have to deal with my mood swings right now.
6708,"I accept that one day I may be able to find new medicines and try them out, but right now I have no other option, and I don't want to go back to constantly thinking of ways I can just end my own life."
6709,TL;DR : I'm off my meds and can finally feel happiness again.
6710,"Family wants me on meds anyway, doesn't care that I've done nothing but want to kill myself for months now after my hospitalization."
6711,"My psychiatrist offers some suggestions, and assures me it is not the meds, but what it comes down to is ***I need to eat!"

6713,I found his struggle with taking medication the most intriguing.
6714,Recently diagnosed and struggling to stick to the meds.
6715,"I'm getting better for sure, since I'm on medication and am seeing a therapist that I really like, and am exercising a lot more and getting ready to start group therapy."
6716,"So, those of you who are more experienced with bipolar disorder, (especially 2) do you find that its something that never goes away, or do you get normal with therapy/meds/whatever else?"
6717,"And for some reason they couldn't get another doctor to refill my prescription...(which has been done before so its not like that would be illegal or impossible or anything) 
If it was a heart medication I was on I very much doubt I would be told I was just gonna have to wait."
6718,"In November of last year, I was hospitalized, and my medication changed to 1g keppra, and 100mg lamictal."
6719,"I'm so ashamed to admit all of this, and I hope that my rl friends don't find my post (on second thought I should make a throwaway) and the bipolar seems to be out of control, so I'm hoping that they adjust my meds again."
6720,Refuse to take antipsychotic meds cuz they make me a zombie/feel horrible.
6721,"I meet with my doctor next week to look into new medication, any tips would help, this long process is making it worse."
6722,"The Old Woman cheers for The Protagonist with the corners of her mouth, as He makes a fool out of The Customer by explaining why payments can't be made on medication."
6723,"Or the pushing of psych meds, and chemical restraints, I was never an advocate."
6724,"I’m not naïve, I know meds do help and so does therapy (hey I’m in healthcare) but I feel like a lot of times it’s either mishandled or just a band-aid solution."
6725,Being a spectrum disorder it often requires a spectrum of medication to treat the episodes/symptoms and maintain better stability.
6726,"They can't really observe you every day, and make medication changes on the fly, or try you on some medication combinations that could in some people cause serious immediate side effects, because you'll be sitting at home wondering whether to go to the emergency room."
6727,They may try to 'buy you off' with some meds.
6728,"Also of note, I've been off all my psyche meds for a year (with doctor approval)."
6729,he took his medication daily and i wasn't very bothered by it.
6730,"he's continuing to not eat or sleep well and he's lost a huge amount of weight, but he is taking (at least most of) his medication."
6731,"He responds fairly well to meds, but after feeling well for a while will stop taking them."
6732,I don't even know if this medicine works super well for me yet and it costs way too much for me to afford.
6733,"My moods have been stable, i've been feeling way better than normal, taking my meds every day, and then this afternoon i lost it."
6734,"I've not had any recent medication changes, but the sleeping seems to be getting worse."
6735,I'm posting here because everyone seems to attribute sleeping too much with depression or over-medication.
6736,He recommended a few medications.

6739,Whenever they see me taking my medication I tell them that it is only to help me sleep.

6748,"Anyways, my mood switches constantly and I'm afraid my meds aren't working anymore (Latuda 40mg, Lomantringe 50mg, Celexa forgot dosage)."
6749,I guess it's just made me make better choices but it makes me wonder if it's something to do with the medication as well?
6750,"My wife hasn’t been diagnosed and isn’t on medication, two things I’m trying to figure out how to remedy."
6751,I can't remember all the medications but I went through several for nearly a year and a half before being put on Welbutrin.
6752,"During the time some of the medications caused me to turn violent, some turned me into a zombie, and others made me want to kill myself."

6761,I've been having a rough few weeks changing meds and doses.
6762,"I feel like after the diagnosis I've basically given up to the idea I could ever get better without medication, but it confuses me what about the addition of hypomania makes the depression more stubborn."
6763,"I hate the idea of having to play chemistry kit with my body under the possibility I have some undetectable mental illness, especially since it seems half of the meds apparently just make the issues *much worse* if not slightly better, with the addition of a hilarious array of other potential complications and side effects."
6764,He doesn't have medical insurance until the 1st of October so he can't get medication till after that.
6765,I run out of meds in 6 days.

6813,It looks like my meds are going to change.
6814,I've seen a bit of doctrine about it online but if there are any of you out there that take these medications for Bipolar I'd be interested in some feedback on how they're going for you.

6832,I have been trying to get stable on meds for a year and a half now and it has been a long journey.

6835,Has anyone here with a bit of a party animal past managed to keep drinking in moderation whilst on meds?

6844,"My days would consist of racing, or fist fighting my friends (we love to fight), or going to the gym and lifting half a thousand pounds, or going on the ambulance to a 911 call and doing intense shit, or before i was working in medicine i would party for days on end banging multiple girls and doing scarface amounts of cocaine at like 17 years old."
6845,We have two kids that I can barely handle...I'm just starting to get stable on my meds...I just got off a pretty crazy rapid cycle mindfuck.
6846,I feel like I just want to flush all my meds and run away.
6847,"So long story short, I've spent over half my life on just about every kind of psychiatric medication there is, with no real luck."
6848,"But there are some things I see about Lithium online that sort of have me second-guessing this whole thing...

1) I'm not on an antidepressant, and my depression is definitely worse than any manic episode I've had (looking back, I'm not even sure it was a manic episode as much as a reaction to other meds.)"
6849,My meds haven't changed either.
6850,Basically you can see a psychiatrist and they give you medication until you can get in with a PDoc to see regularly.
6851,"So here I am sitting in the UPC, I just peed in a cup, I am running off of 3 hours of sleep (maybe) and I have no clue what is going on, how long I will be here, what meds they are going to give me, if they will even help me, and what I am going to do about work/school/everything else in my life."
6852,"I recieved a Bipolar II diagnosis after a LONG journey of doctors, diagnoses, and medications from my doctor before this one (whom I loved, might I add)."
6853,"She changed the diagnosis to Bipolar I. I saw her for a couple of more months after that before I lost my health insurance and couldn't afford ANY medication, even with a discount card."
6854,"She became extremely judgmental and pushy when I told her I needed to taper off this medication, which I understand to an extent because of how common noncompliance is in many bipolar patients."
6855,"But it was just so overly negative that I just stopped showing up to my appointments and tapered off myself (I've been off and on SO many medications, I'm a tapering champ.)"
6856,My energy levels have dropped close to the point before the meds.
6857,"I don't take meds right now, I can sleep half-normally, I'm productive, content and calm."

6860,My mom saw me for the first time on meds last night and didnt like it.
6861,I assured her it was the medicines and I was fine but my quiet reserved side was not to her liking.

Lamictal : 200MG  
Zoloft : 200MG  
Klonopin : 3MG (1 in the morning 2 at night or I'll be awake all night)  
Abilify : 10MG  
All generics ofc."
6863,"I'm just not sure how to handle this, I have no self motivation what-so-ever...  

None of these meds have helped my depression to the extent that I've hoped for."
6864,tl;dr I think my meds are(n't) fucked/working.
6865,I know I need to do better with my medicine and diet/exercise.
6866,"Bipolar 1 I'm assuming (due to the meds), currently on 450mg of Welbutrin, 3 10mg Diazapams (prob should be upped to either 5 or something stronger/faster acting) and now 10mg of Latuda daily due to the fact that the past few days, it's all gone to hell."
6867,"I informed my supervisor (he knows what I'm on with my meds and changing and such, but my personal details aren't his business) and did my thing."
6868,"I get up this morning and it's backed off some, but I take it again with the rest of my meds (as I was told to, doc said taking it at night would hurt my sleep, which he's already refusing to give me sleeping meds even though I average 4 hours a night and have begged for them so I can somewhat have a regular schedule) and it's like it got worse."
6869,"My question is:  Is there really anything I can do, at all, to help myself in this situation, short of going back to work tomorrow or Saturday (since they both count the same against me besides money, of course) either with the side effects (and risking more or having them get worse and wreck or something) or dropping the new meds all together and hope things don't go downhill again (or possibly worse)?"
6870,"Any ideas at all to help me out without putting my job at risk or making enemies that could fire me for no reason at all while still attempting to do the right thing by myself (and my family) with the meds and keeping a job that I like (and could see myself moving up within the company, once I get some seniority/not the idiot at the bottom of the ladder?"
6871,I'm a pretty stubborn guy and for 24 years I've fought medication/help for the issues I have since realized ruined what could be awesome relationships (be it friend or romantic..ugh) and other aspects of life.
6872,I had my first appointment yesterday day and again was told that I had bipolar and that they were keen to get me on medication right away.
6873,antidepressants didn't really work for me and the less medication you're on the better (if it comes time to wean).
6874,"I stayed off any medication for several months, over the Christmas break, and saw a mental health nurse while I was at home (I study away from my home town)."
6875,"Sometimes I have concerns about the medication, I worry whether its the cause of my hair falling out, I wonder whether its the reason I'm constantly sick, though thankfully I seem to have avoided the fabled weight gain =) Just wanted to hear other people's experiences, it's nice to know you're not completely alone"
6876,"After about half a year of stability, and increasing side effects from meds, my psychiatrist and I agreed that I could start going down on my seroquel."
6877,"I get driven home, and take my meds, 200 mg this time...

My question is, do you think it's because of the meds or another factor that caused these sudden episodes?"
6878,"I've been on a couple of different medicines, but now I'm on Lamictal and Geodon."
6879,My meds are all screwed up I think.
6880,Went off my meds (Lamictal/Latuda) a few months ago for maybe a month/month-and-a-half.
6881,I was taking my meds every night and lately I've been missing doses.
6882,I don't like talking about my mental state with my girlfriend or my family because they worry a lot and get really pissed if I don't take my meds.
6883,"etc.. Self-medication with alcohol, sex, beer, and pot."
6884,He is worried that the man he has known as his father his entire life will 'change' and get a different personality now that he is on medication.
6885,I know there's some medication that works differently depending on the dose and I thought Trazodone was one of those but I can't find anything online.
6886,"While the proportion of women using psychotropic medications did not differ between groups, those without premenstrual exacerbation were almost twice as likely to be using SSRIs or SNRIs (p&lt;0.01)."
6887,"...

&gt; Women with premenstrual exacerbation were not less likely to use psychotropic medications in general, but they were less likely than those without to receive treatment with an SSRI or SNRI."
6888,"But since upping my meds and coming down from the mania a bit- well that sexual appetite is gone, and so is the constant state of readiness."
6889,"Then I thought about how the alcohol would possibly trigger her bipolar because unlike me....she doesn't take her medication and today she hasnt replied and ive been worried, would her sleeping off the alcohol stop the trigger or is she stuck like this til she can get some medication or help?"
6890,"Hardcore manic phase lasted until the end of the summer when I quit them cold turkey


I refused medication

I swung horribly into another depressive phase and this semester (my first semester of sophomore year) I took a medical withdrawal."
6891,I was diagnosed and put on meds around 10 weeks ago.
6892,I have a medicine bag by my bed.
6893,"http://i.imgur.com/mzn15.jpg my medicine bag :)

Edit: Just thought this would be a good topic because some may have a hard time with it and maybe others can learn a new trick here or there!"
6894,Different meds different therapies.
6895,"The doctors finally stopped swapping my medication (with my extreme swings medication that would work for a few months sometimes lead to destabilizing me and sending me off the deep end the next swing, this lead to each new doctor prescribing his preferred cocktail and chaos ensuing."
6896,(Standard is 5-6 swings a year for periods usually lasting around 2 months with periods of extreme fluctuations signaling a shift occasionally) I also went off my meds my senior year.
6897,"My pdoc wants to start meds but because I'm going home several states away for three weeks at the end of this week he doesn't want to start till I get back so he can follow-up properly, and that makes sense."
6898,"TL;DR: Crappy mixed state getting worse, can't start meds yet because I won't be able to follow-up with pdoc over my winter break."
6899,"While I graduated, I have been off of medication since 2010 due to moving across country and getting out of the system..."
6900,"**I haven't felt suicidal since** going off of medication but when I read this, it brought back a lot of those feelings from those days."
6901,What medications are you on?
6902,Is this a good medication to be taking with my symptoms?
6903,I just want to know whether i should talk to someone or ask about medication or what.
6904,"I told them I am on new meds that are helping me come out of a pretty bad depression, and I can't help but be enthusiastic."
6905,I want to be off meds but i know it wouldn't end well.
6906,"Since quitting drinking, I’ve made a medicine switch."
6907,"Recently, the intensity of my highs became much higher, so we decided that medication would help."
6908,"I was diagnosed about a month ago, but was just now able to afford the medication."
6909,"i've been on it since 2010, and i still need it, although so much of the medication gave me horrible side effects, including epilepsy, but im no longer on any of it, and in fact im not on the epilepsy medication any more since that too was a side effect."
6910,I think I would benefit from medications again.
6911,I recently got medical aid for the first time and went to one of their listed psychiatrists to either get help going off the medication or else get some sort of diagnosis so I can claim back on medical aid.
6912,"My family and boyfriend are urging me to find a different psychiatrist and I think I must but I am feeling very uncertain about the whole thing, I feel like this is all my fault because I said the wrong things and if I go to a new psychiatrist I might describe it wrong again and this whole stupid train will carry on forever, and I will be on medication for absolutely no reason forever."
6913,I am use to meds to so I can live so remembering bipolar meds are no problem.
6914,Except when I lose my Wellbutrin and all I do is sleep through medication times.
6915,"What i guessing I'm asking is for absolutely any advice you have on everything: medication,mania, depression, family, friends, relationships, vitamins, school, work, unicorn taming.. Well maybe not unicorn training but I'm sure you know what I mean."
6916,"I'm really stable on medication right now, so I'm wondering if the two drinks yesterday could have this affect or if maybe it's just random."
6917,"My dad was adamant about me taking meds and I didn't want to, then I got on them and felt good and neither of us can afford it anymore."
6918,"Before he was diagnosed, he was thrown on a lot of ADD meds, and after diagnosis, he was unable to find success with any of the other meds prescribed to him, and has been unmedicated for many, many years."
6919,"Since seeing this doctor, he has told my husband and his parents that the therapist said he was suffering from amphetamine psychosis--basically, he saw things that weren't there through his childhood/teens because of being on too many ADD meds."
6920,"(He also now refuses to be on any kind of meds for his bipolar, though, again, that has been going on for years anyway."
6921,"But the timing as far as the need to either excuse this 'lie' (if that's what this is) or maintain control after losing his gf over it, plus the fact that no one ever remembers him mentioning any of his hallucinations to people in the past (he claimed that he had talked about things like the uncle to an ex in the past and recently spoke to her about it again, but we have confirmed with her that that never happened), mixed with purchasing the purple heart (we assume this must have been done consciously, as he admitted that was where he got it a couple years ago), and the low amount of ADD meds he was actually on (no more than 20mg a day), it seems very *unlikely*."
6922,"He refuses to take meds, and if he's lying to his doctor, then the doctor isn't doing him any good either."
6923,My father has bipolar depression and takes daily medication for it.
6924,Besides for this one time that it lasted a few months when the medication Paxil made it a lot worse for me.
6925,"It's so frustrating, I feel like my medications are worthless."
6926,But I'm just starting meds so I don't even know that'll be possible eventually.
6927,I said even if it is I need medicine for that.
6928,I've tried so many meds its just that most of them make me suicidal in addition to the problems i already have.
6929,I want to get back on medication ASAP but I have to change insurance once baby is born so there goes the deductible I've met and the out of pocket max I will meet (adding her to my insurance is out of the question - I already pay $500/mo for my other daughter and myself.
6930,"My doctor just increased my medication so with any luck the nausea will subside and my mood will level out, but in the meantime I’m still feeling pretty hopeless and my SO is too."
6931,"It wasn’t until our winter break from school that I had another round of depression (I stopped my meds for a couple weeks, totally my own fault) during which I called him and basically cried the whole time, at one point essentially saying that I felt so awful about how it affected him that sometimes I thought about breaking up so he wouldn’t have to deal with this too."
6932,I tell them I can't I'm on medication and they tell me no I'm not I've been with them the whole time @...
6933,So I've been on my meds (just Abilify) since late September.
6934,I've been on heaps of different medications and none of them work.
6935,"At the moment, I've been off meds for a few months."
6936,"I FEEL like I've noticed different times where he quite possibly may be manic, but he will tell me he can't be because he's on his meds."
6937,He then goes to tell me he's been off his meds and needs to get more and goes on about his bloodwork blah blah.
6938,It's been so long since I've felt stable on meds that I'm hoping others can share their thoughts and experience about my following question.
6939,"The fact that bipolars needs meds to ""stabalize""
How do you figure out normal ?"
6940,"I've had meds that made me flat, no creativity or spark, low energy, basically a quiet blob."
6941,"Society is wrong, I sometimes think many of us don't need medication."
6942,Anybody else have experience with this medication?
6943,After 10 years full of pain and no meds working and things just getting worse when you think it can not get worse she has no hope.
6944,Will medication be able to fix this feeling?
6945,I'm scared that they're going to put me on some crazy meds again.
6946,"thank you in advance for any advice or moral support you guys can provide...

UPDATE---

Thank you everyone who replied, with the kind words, advice, and internet hugs :) I'm out now and I'm getting a prescription for a mood stabilizer (forgot the name of it) and Zoloft until I get an appointment with someone to try different medication."
6947,I'm in the process of switching medication so I've been off mood stabilizers for a couple weeks.
6948,I only stopped it before because I lost my prescription and was frustrated and none of my meds seemed to be helping with depression much anyway.
6949,Im back to noncompliance with my medication and it really pisses me I sabotage myself so often.
6950,So I was diagnosed when I was 11-12 and was taking medication for it until I was 17 im currently 24 and have not been on it for 7 years now.
6951,I am losing it and my depression has taken over to the point I started cutting myself again in secret(long sleeves so no one at work sees it and at home so my roommate doesnt see it) and when I drive to work I feel the urge to slam into a tree at 80 just to end it almost daily but I cant bring myself to do it because I feel its pointless since I have 7 failed suicide attempts so far from when I was both on and off my meds.
6952,He didn't start medication until 1967.
6953,My only previous meds experience was 5 days of Lexapro last year.
6954,"So, I have been taking two different medications concurrently for my bipolar disorder for about 3 or so years now, and recently have been a bit down."
6955,"I told my psychiatrist this, and how I had difficulty focusing on my school work because of the ADHD I was diagnosed with that I have dealt with without medication for nearly 2 decades now."
6956,"I figured it shouldn't be a problem, since I didn't plan on continuing the new medication and would just carry on as I had been."
6957,"I did not realize until about a week ago that the doctor only gave me a one month refill on my old medications, which I found out when I went to get my monthly refills and only had one left on one of the two medications."
6958,"I explained to her that I had never had to do a one month follow up on these medications since I first started taking them, and so I didn't see why it was necessary for me to come back in a month later to get the refills I should have gotten on my last visit (considering it was a follow up visit and all)."
6959,I have since been off one of my meds for a few days now.
6960,"Before this whole debacle with my psychiatrist, I had considered trying to survive without medications, for many reasons including the fact that I hate the idea of having to take medication for the rest of my life and I feel like it stifles me creatively."
6961,Has anyone here worked with their doctor or therapist and been able to go without medication?
6962,"TL;DR; I think my meds are making me crave food, even when I feel very full."
6963,The meds might actually be working!
6964,"I've got my Cisco certifications, but a lot of my computer networking knowledge has been brain farted out from a combination of meds and weed consumption."
6965,Me being a child with adhd and forced to take Ritalin I was inclined to handle this myself without medication.
6966,"I have a good pdoc and meds, and I've gone through extensive group therapy."
6967,I was seeing an individual therapist but I'm fucking broke and can only afford therapy OR meds and meds win.
6968,I'm lost about all this and I guess that is why I have started and stopped meds so often.
6969,the Pdoc said that it might be medication induced or it maybe something more serious.
6970,I've been relatively stable (no major issues) for years by way of medication + regular therapy.
6971,I've progressed as a person over the 20-odd years I've been on medication with the help of my wife.
6972,When my boyfriend told me he didn't want to see me until I changed meds I snapped and I can't get back.
6973,"Why even bother with meds, therapy, psychiatrists?"
6974,I feel bad because I went way over my anti-anxiety (double the amount over the course of the day) medication but that was the only thing that helped the anxiety and crying spells...
6975,I guess what I'm wondering is... am I even unfit for living in society without these medications?
6976,"I've failed myself in many ways (job, relationship) and I lie to everyone around me about the severity of my issue because I want to keep this one job i'm actually happy in... but today after getting off the anti-psychs (which I was initially happy about getting off of, since I hate medication) I feel like i'm suddenly just ""already dead"" not suicidal mind, just a walking dead person."
6977,Can you have a medication-induced full blown manic episode if you're diagnosed bipolar 2?
6978,Are medication-induced manias even a thing?
6979,"When I was in the military and seeking help, they were trying different medication and figuring out my diagnosis."
6980,"I started my meds about a month ago now, and have been doing great with staying in reality."
6981,"**All that being said, has it [birth control] affected you at all/ conflicted with meds?"
6982,"Hi guys, just an update on my medication 150mg Venlafaxine, 100mg Lamotrigine, however it's having no noticeable effects on my depression."
6983,The sad part is my meds even work now.
6984,I am not taking any medications.
6985,"I guess I'm asking for links of great sources that can help her understand me better... maybe so she can stop hurting me and help me move forward... 

(I'm not taking any medications or seeing any professional for my condition, anymore.)"
6986,"I posted a few days ago about how I was going off my meds because I can't afford it, but now I don't know what to do."
6987,"Office visits are $25, meds are $25 (generic); so it's $50 a month."
6988,I can't even tell if meds will even help because it's all situational at this point; not just me sliding into a depression.
6989,"I honestly feel a bit better on meds, but I can't tell if it's hypomania or the drugs working because I always get thrown back  into a depression before I can see if there's any cycling or anything going on."
6990,"I've tried medication, mood stabilizers, SSRI's 5 HTP, and holistic cures (dad's new wife's idea)."
6991,I am on my meds and they help tremendously.
6992,The only problem with the medication is that it completely knocks him out.
6993,"He finds it hard to get motivated to work, which I think is a combination of the meds and the depression side (sometimes the manic also)."

6998,"I don't have a formal diagnosis, I don't have meds yet."
6999,I don't want to stop taking my medication if I don't have to- I'm having such promising results on the wellbutrin.
7000,It's worth adding that my mood swings/symptoms have improved without meds due to me being sober and in therapy.
7001,Does anyone else take ADHD meds regularly and do you find that it helps with your bipolar symptoms?
7002,"*The constant battle to convince myself to shower... :/
*Sounds overwhelming me suddenly
*My low bank account
*How my family constantly critizes me and tells me 'its just a phase' or 'doctors are in this for the money your fine weve all been depressed and got through it without medication'
*My rage when I get overwhelmed
*the random sadness for no reason and explaining to people ""I DONT KNOW WHATS WRONG QUIT ASKING"" 
*the fact im a terrible mother to my kids."
7003,I feel like I may be on the wrong medication.
7004,"It makes me feel unnatural, always bitter and the nightmare only stops around when the medicine is wearing off."
7005,I am afraid to ask my psych if I can try something else because its likely in my mind that I will be put on a similar medicine that will do the same thing to me or destroy my quality of life.
7006,Yesterday I was fine until I took my meds in the evening.
7007,Is this what's supposed to happen with anti-psych meds?

7012,"I'm fine with where I am in terms of getting the help I need, getting meds etc."
7013,I've been reading everything but I haven't really been commenting much and I'm hoping everyone is doing well..I'm getting my meds settled and can finally start to see clearly through the fog of this dysphoric mania that has been clouding my vision.
7014,"I'm taking all the right meds, using the right support groups and just not getting better."
7015,End result: I've been off meds for almost 10 days when I stole something from an acquaintance.
7016,It REALLY did more for me than any medications had.
7017,"The meds I'm on currently have helped me with my depression, appetite and sleeping but I feel like my depression is about 50% down even though I should be about 100%-ish at this stage of my treatment since I've been avoiding alcohol."
7018,"c) I feel like my depression has gone down from severe to moderate with my current meds but I still have problems with motivation, memory and concentration."
7019,"If I was bipolar 2, would switching to proper bipolar meds like lithium and latmotrigine help in fully kicking out my depression?"
7020,I've shared my thoughts with my doctor but he said we should stick with the depression diagnosis and current meds for now.
7021,"I don't know if it could be related to my bipolar (ultra rapid cycling) or possibly my medication, but it's beginning to worry me."
7022,Is it possible that it's a medicine side effect?
7023,"A few weeks ago, I posted on here about how awful I was feeling, how I wasn't taking meds, how scared I was about getting married and basically doubting EVERYTHING in my life."
7024,"Well, I've now been married for just over two weeks, been on my meds consistently since just before the wedding."
7025,Could also be that I'm consistently taking my meds...!
7026,"Self-medication has become dangerous and exhausting for me (and ineffective), but it's all I know as far as dealing with this."
7027,"There are only a few psych meds that don't scare me to death, and in those cases I'd be just as scared of the possibility that those drugs wouldn't work."
7028,"I want more than anything to not feel like a sad-sack misfit anymore, and I guess what I'm saying is: I'm scared that I'm gonna feel that way forever, meds or not."
7029,"She said that all the medications have side effects, particularly lithium which damages the kidneys ability to concentrate urine over time."
7030,"Just restarted my meds last thursday, and the lamictal is nowhere near the dosage I need to be at yet, and the klonopin dosage doesn't seem to be high enough to compensate for the wellbutrin.... Just looking for advice, or whatever."
7031,"Think it's the medication, or something that's just my baggage?"
7032,"Ever since I've been on meds, I've had incredibly strange and vivid dreams."

7035,I spoke with a new doctor today after running out of meds from another doctor (who sucked) and we spoke about my bipolar diagnosis and depression/anxiety.
7036,"Being a hypocondriac, I did some research on the medication and HOLY CRAP I am scared."
7037,Obviously I am not asking for medical advice; just some other experiences on the meds and whether you had the skin rash and what happened next?
7038,"I feel stable, can handle stress very well, have established routines, militantly adhere to my medications (Li, Seroquel, to name some), drink fairly infrequently, have wonderful doctors and support systems."
7039,"I've been terrified to start meds, and I started freaking out even more when I learned 25mg a day is the norm to start out on, not 50mg."

7045,"The thing is, the side effect of the type of medications she was taking IS decreased sexual satisfaction."
7046,"I'm scared that her meds were the reason she may have ended things, and I want to talk to her about it."
7047,"TL;DR: My bi-polar girlfriend/girl I was dating dumped me due to bad sex our first time and not a strong sexual desire for me, both extremely common side effects of the medication she was on."
7048,I took meds (quite reluctantly) until April 2011 when I just couldn't take not having a personality anymore.
7049,Why do I not need meds?
7050,"If I'm leading a fairly ""normal"" life, don't take meds, don't have manic episodes or major depressive episodes for an entire year, why should I still live with this stigma?"
7051,"Was finally able to get in with a new one who immediately changed my meds, treated me in great, tested at lengths for adhd (yes) and got me properly medicated."
7052,We don't have the money to pay psych and meds even through they're generics.

7055,"Things got kinda out offhand last year, and after months of cycling through meds it looks like I'm finally leveling out (somewhat)."
7056,"After being very bored and listless with my life i tried mushrooms with a friend, which actually helped my deoression immesurably, however a subsequent mania had me plan out an entire business (including sweet talking an investor) before i came down and saw reality a bit more : i crashed out and even medication was not enough to let me keep my job."
7057,"I stopped meds then and have been self managing for almost two years, using pot to self medicate as well as lots of isolation, my work is cyclical and has alot of alone time which i find very helpful, however a recent change from job to ""career"" along with a big raise and a new relationship (first in 3 years) is adding alot of stress and making me cycle up and down pretty rapidly, usually i am functional enough on one of my days off to do something productive (laundry, housework) but my work is now suffering."

7061,My cousin warned me up front that she was bi-polar but was on her meds so that set my mind at rest.

7063,I believe she may have been off her meds that night since she was drinking.

7066,She took her meds and then later took a painkiller.
7067,I am dealing with the side effects of these medications trying to become stable.
7068,"I have to balance the good for the bad, changing my medication is always risky and this time the medication that helped me control psychotic anger outbursts is causing sleep problems, I used to sleep 6 hours now I sleep 10 but I still can’t fall asleep at night, along with causing my already poor ability to focus to be worse."
7069,"I'm not on any medication, from what I've read most of them seem to be focused on getting you down from a high -- any antidepressants run the danger of starting yet another hypomanic episode."
7070,I really can't remember if this happened much before I went on meds (my memory is really wonky) but I think it did.
7071,"After that, having everyone in my family calling me, telling me to take medication doesn't help because..."

7085,I'm in therapy and will be seeing a doctor about medication.
7086,"Meds are not my answer right now, the lithium didn't work for me and made me in to a tired twitchy mess and I have no time to adjust to medication and I'm med sensitive so their is a very good chance it isn't going to work or leave me with too many side effects to be worth it."
7087,My friends at crazymeds seem to think that the combination will turn me into a hibernating bear.
7088,"I am not on any medication, and I have done a 6 week emotion regulation group therapy thing (2hr sessions)."
7089,Hell I don't even know if that's a side effect from the meds or just me being tired of feeling like I'm insane.

7092,"I wasn't able to pick the medicines that day, was too busy with everything."
7093,"I always wondered, everyone always told me not to skip my meds, I have a brother with schizophrenia and I know that every so often he'd convince himself that he didn't need them and would stop taking them... that always ended up with him at the hospital."
7094,"The times I mixed alcohol with my meds, things got really messy between me and whoever I was with."
7095,"Oh and I'm off my meds, it's probably that."
7096,The meds aren't helping.
7097,"I have also been tearful, which makes me sick to my stomach, which then I don't eat, but have to take meds, and then suddenly I'm in a very bad place."
7098,"I'm forgetful too, so I'd be really bad at remembering medication."
7099,"I assume that I'd have to go off my meds while I'm trying to get pregnant, during the pregnancy, and while I'm nursing."
7100,"I'd love to have some more personal conversations via PM or even skype, but for now I'll just pose a few of the top questions I had in mind:

1) What, apart from medication, do you feel contributes most to your successful managing of symptoms?"
7101, Anyone got advice on a good nights sleep with out without meds?

7107,"My head felt more clear and level, but my boyfriend noticed an emotional distance beginning to develop at the onset of taking the medication."
7108,I have been off of my medication for about a week.
7109,Occasionally I've lash out and say rude and mean things (while being off my medication).
7110,Treating bipolar as something un-manageble without medications like Type 1 diabetes and pretty much turning off every discussion about quitting meds.
7111,Today I went into see the P.doc today to have my meds adjusted.
7112,Another horrendous experience to throw upon the pyre of horrendous experiences I've had since hunting for someone to handle the medication aspect of things.
7113,I hate that I **need** to take medication to be at a baseline.
7114,I've been through a massive amount of CBT to get to where I am at now and I hate the fact that I must take medication.
7115,I have never done well with medication and my p-doc has suddenly started feeling like the enemy again.
7116,I'm terrified of medications since the past two antidepressants I tried almost got me killed.
7117,"The treatment is so expensive already (I eat a lot of Ramen now), so adding meds is going to make it even worse."
7118,"I asked the psychiatrist at the partial program if they were going to change up my meds with the new diagnosis, and he was like, ""Well, do you want to?"
7119,So I made an appointment with my normal psychiatrist to see what he says about the diagnosis and possible medication changes.
7120,The night before I went to be early and didn't get back up to take my medicine.
7121,I just posted recently about how much better I'm feeling on my new medication cocktail.
7122,"I'm so out of touch, and of course I stop seeing my doctor and taking meds."
7123,I was in the hospital for ten days until they could get my meds worked out.
7124,I have BP2 &amp;amp; am thinking about this in relation to how much switching medications will really help my depressive symptoms.
7125,"So my psychiatrist said we may have to totally change the meds, which is always a little scary (possible side effects, etc)."
7126,Do you guys think meds are a means of covering up a side of you that sees things for what they are in an attempt to assuage you.
7127,"I feel like I can't handle reality and the possibility of becoming a ""loser"" so I take medications to handle life."
7128,I'm taking my meds.
7129,"and i know the nighttime meds are kicking in when i talk about something like that :P

**this was complete random thoughts."
7130,"To make matters worse, he went off his meds three weeks ago and now his behavior is getting more and more destructive/risky."
7131,"I have an appointment for a doctor there, I'm just concerned that I wont be able to get my meds filled when he prescribes them to me since he wont be an 'approved provider' under my insurance."
7132,"I guess I'll find out soon though, but I doubt it because I originally couldn't fill my scripts from this new psychiatrist because she wasn't showing up as a provider covered by my insurance and I couldn't get my meds for a couple of days, but it got straightened out and I was able to get my meds eventually."
7133,I've been diagnosed bipolar for about 9 months and every 2-3 months my doctor keeps increasing my medication (Sodium Valproate) It seemed great and I returned to a university course that I dropped out of a few years ago (due to depression).
7134,I had some moderate success when I was originally diagnosed (about a year ago) and started taking my medication (lamictal 200mg) but inevitably I'd end up in a minor manic or depressed phase and screw it all up.
7135,"So I assumed, this was my diagnose now, my doctor didn't talk to me much after that, just told me, that now Finlepsin is my main medicine."
7136,"Recently, due to not enough sleep and too much party, and probably also inconsistent medication, my Girlfriend has become quite manic for the first time in a while."
7137,"This is almost identical to what happened last year, although she was not on the same medication (She was on anti-depressants instead of mood-stabilisers)."
7138,Does anyone else drink while on meds?
7139,"I just spend the last week in and out of the emergency room 5 times due to an allergic reaction to a new med, I even at one point asked the prescribing doctor about the symptoms I was having and she said there is no way they could cause the symptoms, so I continued taking the meds, only three doses, and about a weeks worth of ER visits, and then a kick in the nuts when she gave me my rx's, one good, the second wasn't even my prescription, well it was.... just did not have my name....

  ECT treatments, should I pursue?"
7140,"I am seeing a great therapist/psychiatrist, etc, on meds la dee da."
7141,Since then I have not been treating the bipolar with medications and I seemed to be doing pretty well.
7142,"I was hospitalized and put on more medications, Risperdone made me lactate so my doc took me off of it."
7143,I am terrified of being on medication again though after what the Prozac did.
7144,Has anyone been successful in controlling your illness without meds?
7145,Scared of meds now.
7146,"Not on meds, the saphris made me shake and tremble all night."
7147,I was diagnosed with bipolar I when I was 20 and finally started medication for it when I was 25 and have finally stabilized.
7148,It's been a rough month and I was even hospitalized for 5 days but they didn't change my meds.
7149,The pdoc they I saw last week was the one that agreed a medication change was needed.
7150,"edit: fixed the link 

edit 2: I am not saying anyone should stop taking their medication."
7151,"I posted a few days ago about starting meds, but I think I had a really bad reaction to them because last night, I attempted suicide."
7152,I don't know if it's clear enough of a pattern to be considered manic-depressive and I might just be experiencing conformation bias but IDK - at any rate I don't think it's severe enough for medication or hospitalization or anything but I was wondering your thoughts on this.
7153,Any suggestions are far as meds?
7154,"I have previously tried four different groups, including the one I was mandated to attend after my first institutionalization, and found them to be full of people worse off than myself with poor coping skills who spend a lot of time complaining about their medications to a room full of people who are not doctors."
7155,"He's on meds right now, but really depressed and anxious."
7156,"He keeps saying that he feels none of the meds work and he's just doing what everyone else ""wants him to""."
7157,"Constantly talks about going off his meds, and feels no one appreciates that he's been sober (though also constantly talks about how he was free when he drank and smoked)."
7158,I don't feel the depression so much thanks to my new round of meds.
7159,I've achieved a functioning state after a few years of counseling and my psychiatrist finding the right combo of meds.
7160,I've had varying degrees of sexual side effects while going through a litany of medications in 5 years.
7161,Has anyone gone through something similar and had success with ED meds?
7162,It'll be at least a month before I can get meds.
7163,"None of these medications are working, so something is wrong…
And then you read online forums from other people with bipolar disorder, and it's like SHIT."
7164,-Do you feel talk therapy is as effective as medication?
7165,My medicine hasn't been working for about 10 weeks.
7166,"Tldr; taking off work to try to gets meds straight before I lose my shit,job,or hurt someone/myself"
7167,"She takes her meds regularly and sees her Dr. Often, but she seems to be having a really hard time recently."
7168,"This is the only medication I've taken that didn't take away every part of my personality that I did admire, and didn't completely destroy who I was."
7169,"I need to choose a career that I'm interested in, that also won't stress me out and unbalance the medication."
7170,Is there any medication or vitamins that will help stabilize my mood?
7171,"I swear, I feel more depressed today than I did before I was on medication."
7172,I felt like my medicines were working since they increased it.
7173,And medicationless.
7174,I feel an uncomfortable amount of happiness and productiveness sometimes and I can't sleep without my sleep medicine.
7175,"Since I was in such a crunch I abided, went to the doctors he wanted me to see and took the meds they wanted me to take."
7176,"One of the things they put me on was risperidone, and that medicine made me very physically sick."
7177,"I made few friends during that time thanks to the sweat and stench of sour medicine, and wished I could have just slept it off, but I couldn't stand to spend any more time at home."
7178,"Also: being forced on meds when you do not have any sort of official diagnosis beyond ""PTSD DUE TO SHITTY CHILDHOOD/PARENTS"" is complete horse shit."
7179,"Again, they took one look at me, tattooed, withdrawing from the cocktail of medicine they put me on in the previous hospital, recently out of a mental hospital, and decided that since I had no where else to go a month in a mental ward would be a good idea."
7180,"Since then, my boyfriend has helped me withdraw completely off of medicine, including benzos which was literally hell."
7181,She didn't mention medication this evening.
7182,My bipolar has been particularly bad lately and I've been off medication since January.
7183,We had a nice little chat about medications we were on and she gave me tidbits of advice that were useful to hear.
7184,FYI: Not everyone will have the same experience on any of these medications this information applies to my individual case only although these exact symptoms have been documented elsewhere.
7185,"Do your own research before willingly accepting any prescriptions for psychotropic, neuroleptic, antipsychotics medications (etc.)"
7186,Also important is prior drug usage history this can and does have an impact on outcomes with said medications.
7187,I'm sharing this only for the purposes of providing information *AND FAIR WARNING* to others seeking information concerning certain medications prescribed to persons diagnosed with Bipolar II (also maybe Bipolar I but I have no experience on that subject).
7188,My diet has not changed but I am completely unable to exercise due to permanent side effects of the medications covered herein.
7189,Outcome: Successful received prescription for ADD medications.
7190,"Other medications:

* clonazepam low dosage as needed for anxiety
* Quetiapine as needed for sleep and anxiety
* Zolpidem as needed for sleep

Most observations were confirm via 3rd parties who witnessed behavior directly."
7191,I will skip issues with antidepressants (especially SSRI's) as it is well known that these medications are largely unsuitable for those diagnosed with Bipolar II (possibly also Bipolar I - I have no experience).
7192,"Topomax/Topiramate (titrated) - Subsequent to hospitalization
====================================

Dosage: 100mg max daily

While reducing lithium dosage I spoke with my doctor about this medication as I had researched and found some intriguing Initial results for mood stabilization with the benefit of possible weight loss (or at least control of weight gain)."
7193,"Finally I decided to take matters into my own hands and immediately stopped taking the medication and waited for the eventual withdrawal symptoms to arrive - and they did within 24 hours:

Outcome: Unable to even begin to rate - it is *possible* (speculation!)"
7194,I was not under care of any doctor during this time indeed they had instructed me to continue taking the medication.
7195,* Severe insomnia only treatable with higher doses of medication (Quetiapine which I was also desperately trying to reduce at the time).
7196,Mentally of course I am struggling but I will work with the doctors to find some alternative treatment - at this point I have lost all faith in these medications and fear for my life.
7197,It is deeply troubling and no one seems to see the connection between what is happening to me now and the awful experience with mood-stabilizing medications (at least those I tried - I cannot speak for all of them).
7198,Whatever the cause I ended up with a 'diagnosis' of Bipolar II and was placed on certain medications to 'stabilize my mood' for the benefit of myself (and likely those around me although I was never considered a true threat to others at any time before then).
7199,"These medications work for a vast majority of people but for some, and for me in particular the result has been catastrophic."
7200,"To put it bluntly, these medications almost killed me - they ended the life I once had and left me with a shattered shell of something I don't even recognize."
7201,Just curious do you feel alive when drinking alcohol on meds?
7202,"I just started meds for Bipolar 2, and its been a crappy first few months."
7203,Does anyone else here on meds go to therapy on a weekly or biweekly basis?
7204,"Nobody witnessed it, no mental health professional that is, as it happened when I was not taking my medication and I had medication to take when things got out of hand, so I took it and everything went back to normal."
7205,"I think I'm going to ask my doctor for medication to make my sex drive go away, if such a thing exists."
7206,I think I'd like to try medication and then add therapy to complement that.
7207,"Do you find on medication it makes it easier, less pressure?"
7208,My dr is treating my bipolar but won't treat my anxiety or panic attacks with anti anxiety meds.
7209,Everytime I bring it up she just adds something new but not the anti anxiety meds.
7210,But as people who have issues know when you have an actual problem you don't get a high from meds.
7211,"Here's a breakdown of my meds what's your thoughts
Daily meds:
Respirdal
Lexapro
Lamictal
Wellbutrin

As needed for sleep:
Remeron"
7212,I've tried so many medications that haven't worked and I'm tired of trying to just disappoint myself.
7213,Every time I go on a medication it makes me feel good at first but then I relapse.
7214,I'm scared because there are very few medications for bipolar depression.
7215,Do certain bipolar meds help?
7216,"On top of all that, my meds keep me from really releasing any emotion."
7217,"i want to quit my meds because i just feel so blank and tiny that something, anything, would be better than this."
7218,Now I feel as though my medication is getting the best of me.
7219,"I am medicated and do take my meds regularly, so keep that in mind."
7220,"I went off of my meds back in November when they started putting me to sleep, at work, 14 hours after taking them."
7221,"Immediately leading up to my NP and my mutual medication decision, my wife and I were (and have been since the start of our relationship/marriage) having severe marital issues."
7222,My wife has continued taking her prescribed bipolar medication and has actively sought therapy with a psychologist.
7223,I'm 25 and was diagnosed BP2/add at 15 and went straight on meds.
7224,My parents pay for my therapy and meds though so I'm grateful.
7225,I don't know if the doctor will change my medication to something that will deal with the low mood as well and I'm worried.
7226,"This is the first time I've been depressed under the formal diagnosis of bipolar, and whilst I've only ever been on antidepressants before (they actually made things worse) I'm concerned I won't find a medication that will work."
7227,"I'm not able to take my meds this morning and I didn't last night either, I might not be able to this evening either."
7228,"Was supposed to get blood taken to check levels of valproic acid last week but she thought I wasn't on the meds long enough, so I'm going back this Monday to take blood."
7229,I only sleep because my meds make me.
7230,I have been on meds for 4 of them.
7231,I'm 16 years old and have never been prescribed any medication before.
7232,"I don't mean a medication induced numbing, but a purposeful emotional numbing, like your mind is attempting handle the randomly firing neurons by shutting them all down?"
7233,This went on for a good part of a month and I had been switching medicines alot with my Doctor who I was terrified to go to cause of the waiting room.
7234,The result was I was now on six different medication they wouldn't explain to me.
7235,"While I'm on medication for the first time (risperdone/lithium) I'm already beginning to notice I'm more energized and focused, getting a lot of different projects done, and feeling great for this first time all year."
7236,"I can't find any medications which will effectively manage my symptoms without terrible side effects, and I can't establish a consistent relationship with a therapist because I keep running out of money for the copays due to manic spending sprees."
7237,I have been relatively stable even though I've been off my meds for a while now.
7238,I probably have permanent heart and liver damage because of it and now my parents are going to lock up my meds.
7239,"We talked back and forth more than I mentioned here but he absolutely would not let me say what he knew I was trying to say which is ""wtf man where are your meds""

As someone diagnosed with bipolar I thought I'd be able to have a chance at helping him."
7240,I still am on medication.
7241,"I am diagnosed with bipolar 1 and have experienced mainly mania with psychotic symptoms, with little depression when off medication."
7242,On medication I'm perfectly fine and lead a normal happy life.
7243,"Eventually I gave up, I thought I was better and decided to come off my meds, I had periods of being volatile and I just thought it was ""who I was"", it didn't register to me that it could be a mental health problem at the time."
7244,"I began to see a psychiatrist who took some time to decide what was wrong with me, this is partly my fault of course due to me not being talkative enough and tending only to give one word answers, it took me some time to build up a trust with her and a few weeks before I felt truly able to express myself properly, it was then she came up with me being possibly Bipolar and put me on a low dose of Lamictal, which did nothing of course initially, about 3 months later after an increase in the dose I started to feel a little different, mostly in the way I reacted to things, I still had the swings, but they were slightly less severe than before, then I had a fantastic week away from home, I was happy and at ease and I felt very stable, I started to forget to take my meds and unfortunately it continued from there."
7245,I haven't told my psychiatrist about stopping and restarting my meds.
7246,"I realise it's my own fault for stopping my meds I guess, but I have learned my lession now and really want to go ahead with this, my next appointment with the psychiatrist isn't until March."
7247,"I don't even know if these meds will help me, I'm hearing things at times that aren't there, I self harm as well and have done since being a teen (it frustrates me that there only seems to help available to teens for this, it's as if older people don't do it?"
7248,Point is my meds have been changed around a lot in the last half year or so...
7249,"Other than the sleep trouble I've felt fairly normal, but the last few days my SO has been pointing out moments(just moments) where he feels like I may be going into a mixed state, which were much more normal for me before meds than after."
7250,I told him...I want to take it slow and I don't know how my new meds are going to change things.
7251,Things were going great for a while until my meds kicked in and I was no longer sexual.
7252,Which is bullshit since i take my meds every damn day.
7253,"She is mostly good with her meds, but sometimes “forgets to refill prescriptions” including hormonal birth control which in my opinion really fucks with her moods and her ability to stay non-angry/violent."
7254,"Never really apologizes for anything, doesn’t think it’s even that bad..  Won’t include me in her treatment plan, doesn’t even really think it’s an issue since she’s taking her meds for the most part."
7255,I'm on new meds and I've been feeling more stable and happy than I have in a long time.
7256,"And they made a planning for me, so now on tuesday i will get new meds that works better for those with bipolar (I have Citalopram SSRI right now, and it isn't working very well.)"
7257,"Little did I know, psychiatrists can prescribe pain medication, also."
7258,I don't see a reason to talk to anyone or get a diagnosis because I wouldn't want to take any medication anyway.
7259,I have been off all medication for a couple of months now.
7260,"By then, I had been on new meds for 2 weeks and the consequences of a full semester of rapid cycling and depression had finally hit me."
7261,Happy to accept treatment options re medication though - but I'm kind of feeling like I'm grieving for a more carefree albeit unstable self versus someone who will have to be constantly vigilant.
7262,"Outside of nightmares and the five minutes a day I dare myself to not take my medication, I feel that I'm doing well."
7263,"So, long story short, I was on 15 mg of Abilify and 1350 mg of lithium and super steady on those meds."
7264,My doc and I decided to taper off the abilify (he doesn't believe its necessary as a maintenance med) and start transitioning from lithium to lamictal (he believes it to personally be the superior medicine).
7265,"I explained that's not necessarily a good thing, and she said she supports me no matter what meds I'm on, but by the same token, she hasn't mentioned marriage counseling once since I lowered my meds (she did it quite often when I was on them), and its clear our relationship is oddly better."
7266,"I'm pretty apprehensive about taking medication, but seeing as Trileptal seemed to have a mild side effect profile, I decided to give it a try and be open-minded."
7267,"Now, I research any potential medications I take like crazy."
7268,I made a post earlier this month about being kicked out of school because I quit taking my meds to avoid being screened and labeled with a disability that would affect the future of my career.
7269,"My parents were livid with me but told me they'd help me get therapy and back on track with meds again, but I had to stop self-medicating with alcohol."
7270,"This means I can't afford meds, doctor's appointments, and therapy."
7271,So I have my regular doc for that and my psych for the psych medications.
7272,"Because I can't live with the idea of taking meds on a daily basis and not being ""myself"", as my complete self."
7273,"I'm not judging people who take medication, I'm just saying that it's something I couldn't live with right now."
7274,"I stopped seeing my pschiatrist because she was pushing too hard for meds and was being really harsh, and haven't seen any psy ever since."
7275,He stopped taking his meds(lithium) months ago and is showing symptoms of mania.
7276,"We are working to get him back on his meds but short of watching him take his meds (3 times a day which is not practical), I'm looking for options to ensure that he is taking them."
7277,* hold his meds for him and require him to go to a family member 3 times a day to get take it.
7278,* Call him via Apple Facetime and ask him to show us that he has taken his meds.
7279,I guess what I am asking is what are your best non-medicine/dr related tips?
7280,I quit my meds in 2012 and only smoked pot since then.
7281,"I just got fired from my job because they were ""sick of dealing with it""

My junk doesn't work from my meds I'm miserable I'm still having like 2 beers a night but I know I shouldnt."
7282,She did take anxiety meds.
7283,With medication can you still go manic or depressed?
7284,I stay on top of my medications for the most part with some slips here and there.
7285,"I've been on a lot of medications and start and end my day with Lamictal, Depakote, and Klonopin."
7286,"My doctor has had me on bipolar meds for a year, though because she's not a psychologist can't officially diagnose me, so she sent a referral to the only psychologist in my area for a psych evaluation."
7287,"I'm meeting with my PDoc tomorrow, and have been on an anti-anxiety medication he prescribed."
7288,(I am on meds -Latuda- and regularly seeing a doctor for the record)
7289,Those depressions do need meds to end.
7290,"I feel so disabled by my mood, and am scared of trying to manage them without meds."
7291,"He said he wanted to switch up my meds immediately so he is now tapering me off Latuda, probably Abilify too."
7292,I can't imagine the kind of intellectual creativity I'll be capable of churning out not being on any meds.
7293,"It begs the question, is the real version of me the one not on meds or the one who takes meds everyday?"
7294,I'm way more insightful and imaginative when on less meds that's for sure.
7295,"Waiting to see my therapist and I just had all around crappy day, can't buy my meds, and I am giving him my box cutter today."
7296,I really really really don't want to be on meds.
7297,I was recently diagnosed and to me it sounds like the meds would make me depressed.
7298,Will meds do nothing but take away the mania?
7299,"Well since i've first noticed issues it's has been eight years of having this ""mental illness"" I've always wondered is medication worth it?"
7300,I am beginning a hypomanic cycle which is probably due to new medication (Brintellix).
7301,Then I remember what its like when I'm not on medication.
7302,I was diagnosed with it and on medication.
7303,Lithium levels were great but apparently I now have thyroid problems that I am going on medication before.
7304,Has anyone had a low thyroid and take or not taken medicine for it ?
7305,**MANDATORY DISCLAIMER:** This anecdote is in NO WAY meant to tell ANYONE to stop taking medication.
7306,"So as the title says, I have been medication-free for 4 years."
7307,"I was immediately put on medication, which numbed me."
7308,"I was immediately hospitalized, put on countless medications and continued to suffer and be in and out of the hospital over the course of the next 3 years."
7309,"8 years that I'd been struggling with mental illness - I couldn't work, could barely stay in school, was overweight as a side effect from one of many medications and just utterly shit-feeling."
7310,Luckily I survived (obviously) but I no longer had the desire to play this meds game.
7311,"It took a leap of faith and a lot of support from close ones and my doctors, but I decided to try to manage off of medication."
7312,"However, the latter would be to be barely functional, on 8 meds a day feeling nothing and being able to create nothing (I am also an artist)."
7313,"I don't know if anyone can relate to my experience and ONCE AGAIN I am NOT recommending that you go off meds nor am I reporting them (I know that meds work really well for a lot of people), but if you are med resistant like me, don't give up."
7314,(Weed and Husband are my first reason to hurt myself).They want me to stop smoking to give me more medication.
7315,"I've been diagnosed for depression and anxiety in the past, and I take medication for it."
7316,"They don't want me to change, they don't want me on tons of medication."
7317,He knows I have meds that I dutifully take everyday but he's not interested in listening to my weird inner life.
7318,"My meds are great, and I feel like I have been very stable."
7319,Here's the kicker: she's an internal medicine doctor.
7320,Please give your meds time to work.
7321,But I have been stable for 8 years and if I got off balance enought o drink I would tell my wife and doctor and we would fix my meds and I would straighten up and fly right.
7322,I was wondering if this medicine had the same effect on anyone else that had to take it?
7323,"If not, what has your experience been like when taking this medication?"
7324,"I have sleep meds, but I can't take them consistently because they make my brain extra foggy."
7325,My parents and nurses always presented my meds to me first thing in the morning and wouldn't go away until I'd taken them.
7326,"Btw, I don't know if this will help but I'm 20yr old female with bipolar since 17yr old and am on medications which have been working."
7327,Are there over-the-counter medicine or natural foods/herbs that are helpful for brain stability?
7328,"I also went off of my meds, bought a house, got engaged - I mean my life I was fucking crazy."
7329,"I'm taking my medications, *all* of my medications."
7330,I've been on my medication for 3 weeks and I've been incredibly depressed.
7331,I go without meds because none have helped.
7332,I normally manage without the meds fine.
7333,"I wouldn't have been his patient for long regardless because he was a dick, but now I am not seeing anyone for the psychiatric medicine I am taking."
7334,Should I stop taking the medicine?
7335,Does anybody else get night sweats on their medication?
7336,"My father has had severe depression his entire life, when he has a bad patch me and mum call it his 'black moods', we urged him to go to the doctors once which he did for us, the doc gave him some meds and mentioned concerns about manic depression, dad never went back to the docs again and quit his meds."
7337,I dislike medication and would not take it if prescribed.
7338,"Another reason for not taking meds, specifically lithium is the idea of regular blood tests, I have no phobia of needles just a discomfort/fear of having my blood taken."
7339,First off I'm on meds and I experience all these traits.
7340,"I do lift my head into the hypo cloud once or twice a year, but I never ""crash"" like I probably would have without my medication -- I simply return to an euthymic state."
7341,Because I know that the other meds haven't had a chance to do their job yet.
7342,So....I'm trying to help my friend figure out how to get her mom into an inpatient program to get on meds and stabilize.
7343,"I'm on medication and there have been much improvement, but I still have yet the will or motivation to do anything about it."
7344,I've evened out enough (thanks to meds) so my swings are less rapid than they used to be.
7345,"Over the course of the time I was on medication, it was easy for me to blame my lack of desire as a side effect, but it has been close to 4 months without it and I still feel absolutely nothing."
7346,"Before medication I felt like I had a normal drive, I was in a relationship and everything was just fine."
7347,"I've been on a slew of medicines, but am unmedicated now."
7348,"Mostly things are good, with only a bit of self-medication with small amounts of cannabis when the highs or lows start really creeping up on me."
7349,"I know I need to go back to therapy and get the right meds, especially now that I'm having these PTSD-like symptoms."
7350,Does anyone take meds along w/ the lamictal?
7351,I stopped meds because I didn't want any of my MH drugs going to baby.
7352,I don't want to start meds because I'm scared of being knocked out by the mood stabilizers *and* I don't want any of that going to my baby.
7353,"http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/healthprofessionals/bipolardisorder/managingbipolardisorder/medicationsinbipolardisorder.cfm

Im not sure why my doctor prescribed me 200-400mg."
7354,"I figured that since I had so much fun while manic, that I could cope with *abruptly stopping my meds*."
7355,"And that kids, is how I learned that the hypomania is not a ""good"" thing, and that the meds aren't just there for when you're feeling depressed."
7356,I take eight medications.
7357,The bulk of the cost is from three brand name medications.
7358,"I am quite reluctant about the medication, however at this point really, I am just about willing to try anything."
7359,"So I plan to start tomorrow, I was hoping if there is anyone here who knew anything about this medication."
7360,but its been about two months since my last post and since then ive been good about taking my meds on the regular.
7361,"Hi all,

I know this is bit of a taboo topic around these parts, and that this subreddit is very encouraging of using medication to deal with our collective disorder."
7362,"I have absolutely no problem with that, and think that a lot of the time medication can do wonderful things for people."
7363,"I feel like (as someone who is Bipolar Type 2) that in the case of Type 1 it makes even more sense to use medication as the manic periods can be even more difficult to control (Once again, I've never experienced true mania so it's hard for me to say)."
7364,"But personally, I've always been against taking medication to deal with my own issues."
7365,Between these supports and my therapist I've always felt like I can manage without taking medication.
7366,How many of you are dealing with your disorder without meds and feel like you're succeeding?
7367,"Like I said, I think medication can be very useful and in some cases necessary."
7368,"But at the same time, I feel like on there are also anecdotal cases where meds were not necessary."
7369,"I'm not trying to  call anyone out, or start an argument between meds vs no meds, only attempting to facilitate a discussion between the community."
7370,"On top of that, people who are currently taking meds, what's it like?"
7371,I don't want to take medication because of the side effects associated with it.
7372,Anyone here doing it without medication?
7373,"I am on the lowest dosis of medication I've been in years, no antipsychotics or mood stabilizers."
7374,I usually get the rare and stupid sideffects on any meds I take and Im wondering if this is worth it.
7375,"I got on meds, then got off of them without consulting a doctor first."
7376,"I've been fed a big list of medications, from anti psychotics to mood stabilizers, and none seem to work."
7377,Started me on Abilify and I'm going in to see him this week to talk about where I'm at and hopefully get on some anti-anxiety meds.
7378,"Just take some meds, crazy."
7379,"On the counter, I take twice a day for bipolar
On the label for anyone to see
Even if you miss the label-
I'm just curious, why does she have all of these medication bottles?"
7380,I've been successful in finding the right meds!
7381,I always have such a hard time when I wean off of a medication.
7382,The reason for stopping her meds is she thinks she will be able to just control it herself.
7383,Has anyone had a friend or someone say something that got them to realize how important medication and counseling is to controlling this disorder?
7384,"I'm on medication and in therapy, and *trying* to eat and be healthy again."
7385,"Throwing the need to cut down on alcohol, medication, stigma around the disorder etc, I'm just really not sure how to navigate this area of my life."
7386,Or I take the meds and all my problems go away (at least according to my doctors.
7387,"I've heard stories about how people lose all sense of their personalities after starting meds and I'm not willing to give up who I am, I don't want to lose me."
7388,When I got my job back I explain why that was an issue before and that now I'm on medication.
7389,Its not something that I like to admit and with the meds that I am taking now I feel that I can function normally within reason.
7390,"Most recently she declared that, while she knows she's bipolar, she doesn't want to take medication because she doesn't want to lose her mania."
7391,"Anyway, we are stuck in treatments (docs, pdocs, meds, therapy, etc)."
7392,"My 15 year old schizotypal niece always reminds me... take control of that which you can control... the rest, just stay flexible and remember your meds."
7393,So my plan is to tell her that I want this medication and she needs to grown some balls and let me get on it one little pill at a time.
7394,But seriously...I need my meds back.
7395,I don't take any meds.
7396,"i am off almost all my meds because they never did anything good, just terrible side effects."
7397,"ive tried eating really well, exercising, a million different combinations of medicine, etc."
7398,Something I could research and address with the right medications (lamotrigine/fluoxetine) and therapy.
7399,Bipolar disorder usually requires medication and it can take a long time to find the right ones.
7400,What meds got you out of feeling depressed?
7401,"When it comes to hospital staff, before getting on medications and a full diagnostic write up that I literally had to beg aka ""advocate"" for, I was considered a ""frequent flyer"" and was rarely helped."
7402,"The most ""help"" I got during that time was getting antidepressants thrown at me (*while later telling me bipolar medication is not a ""cure""- they never said that the about ADs that sent me into psychosis*), the least help was getting ignored in emergency for hours (*I was brought there by my husband, and I ended up leaving, he called the cops, I got cuffed for trying to run and got brought back to the hospital where I was then promptly accepted overnight*) while I sat and watched seeing others get in ""ahead"" of me in line."
7403,"But if I quit this job and ask my parents to house me while I get stable on meds, I will go CRAZY from boredom and loneliness, plus no girl wants to date an unemployed guy."
7404,I was given Zoloft as a medication.
7405,But after a year my medication wore out and I was too lazy to go back to get it refilled.
7406,My dr last reccomended that I get a blood test to figure out what is causing this - but i'm almost convinced this is a side effect from my meds.
7407,"The problem I have is I feel like i'm stuck, i've been on a wide range of meds over the years and I know how difficult it is to go off a medication or start a new one."
7408,"My psychiatrist is thinking about adding an anti-psychotic into my medication regimen (I currently take 450 mgs of Welbutrin, 30 mgs of Buspar and 200 mgs of lamictal) because I'm not responding to the anti-epileptics alone."
7409,"Thanks to medication and a psych whom I trust, I know I have bp, and I have been pulled out of a year long depression."
7410,"Before I knew what the hell was going on, before the medication, the therapy sessions, the subsequent diagnosis, and the resultant intense introspection and navel gazing, it was like I was in a woods."
7411,"And now, with the unexpected diagnosis, the medications, the self doubt (the continuing nagging voice I can't seem to shake that tells me, despite all evidence to the contrary, that it's all a misunderstanding-perhaps even some weird unconscious need for attention that I have hidden deep inside myself), it feels like I've run out of the woods unexpectedly onto a vast, empty and flat prairie, totally exposed with nowhere to hide."
7412,So on one hand I feel disgustingly motivated like I just did ADD meds (which is accurate because I can't focus either) but on the other I am reflecting on how the past five months are pretty much just a black hole wherein I was on autopilot and barely existed as a person.
7413,"He didn't indicate that I'd have another appt, but I also don't find it likely that he'd share my diagnosis and prescribe meds over the phone."
7414,"My doc thinks I need to continue to up my dosage to even out, which is what I will do for now, but just curious to hear from anyone else if they've had an experience like this on Latuda or any other medication."
7415,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 15, went through about a dozen different meds that never helped."
7416,"I know it's probably in comparison to being manic and fast paced, but I feel like meds just slow the day down."
7417,She's been avoiding medication and spending lots of money.
7418,She's been reading up on Trileptal and the different side effects and is really turned off and stressed out by the idea of switching medications.
7419,She's told me that Zyprexa really helps her to function at work and keeps her stable and that she doesn't want to deal with switching to another medication in the event it doesn't work for her.
7420,A lot of meds she has tried in the past have caused her to be nauseous or exhausted or miserable and irritable all day and that's not something she wants to deal with at work.
7421,Or she will bite the bullet and switch medications and the side effects will cause her to miss work or have to leave and she will lose her job.
7422,I've actually felt angrier and had more negative thoughts since starting the medication.
7423,The last few medications I've tried have only made me worse.
7424,After many medication changes I was finally put on a mood stabilizer.
7425,"My problem right now is that my therapist for group has spent the last couple days telling me and the rest of the group that we aren't ""mentally ill"" and keeps talking about how we feel is a product of our ""life choices"" and that we eventually ""won't need medicine""."
7426,"As well, she's given us a lot of horror stories about what the psych meds can do to our bodies."
7427,"I was very happy when my doc made the prescription and I felt like there was hope, but after reading a lot about the medicines, I'm scared."
7428,"""I NEED HELP...paying my rent when I get too depressed to work and the meds take 6-8 weeks to work, at best."""
7429,Imagine socialized medicine.
7430,"I wanted everyone on here to know, that after MONTHS of hell and being very ill, my medicine is starting to work and I feel SOOOO much better!"
7431,"Everything gets better with time, medicine, therapy, and a support system!"
7432,"My last psych was a horrible fit for me, not wanting to explore if I was bipolar when I asked and only trying me on meds once and taking me off after just a few months without trying other doses."
7433,Skip ahead to beginning of this year when my mom was diagnosed with bipolar and said once she started the correct meds everything felt incredibly better.
7434,I went off all but one of my meds.
7435,"I mean, I know I need to be on my meds, but I feel completely ignored at home."
7436,"In light of a recent post, I implore you to check Costco.com to see how cheap your meds can be!!"
7437,"Someone was paying over $300 for 2 weeks of Seroquel at CVS, Costco had their meds for $94 for THREE MONTHS!"
7438,"If I were to see my regular doctor and explain my situation, I think she would prescribe the meds and fill out the medical certificate without question."
7439,"I've been on prozac, seroquel, lamictal, celexa, and now my new psychiatrist put me on these two new meds."
7440,I'm at the gym and seriously just ran 5 miles to try to keep away the feeling of wanting to down all my medicine and taking a swim.
7441,I think another factor in my lethargic state is a change in my medication.
7442,"A month in, we went to a party, she got really drunk (she was taking meds) and I caught her inches away from kissing another guy."
7443,Then after a few months she had quit medication.
7444,So she quit meds.
7445,Mostly due to me not staying on meds but there were other factors.
7446,"So, my meds (Lamictal and Pristiq) seen to be working out for me pretty well at the moment, but for about 2 days out of every month I just bawl my eyes out constantly."
7447,"But, the graph *does* make me feel better about dealing with the side effects long enough to see if the meds will help long term."
7448,Has anyone used these types of supplements and had a bad reaction because of medication or bipolar in general?
7449,I was diagnosed 4 years ago in the midst of a terrible hypomanic episode after a terrible depressive episode and ever since then I've been on and off of meds.
7450,"I haven't been unmedicated for very long at all during my life (have been on meds from a young age, took a 6-month gap two years ago, wound up with BP-2 diagnosis)."
7451,I realize my meds need adjusting.
7452,"Her main concern is that if she goes to a psychologist she will be put on medication, and she feels that whatever is going on doesn't warrant meds and that she doesn't want to deal with potential side effects/personality changes/effect on school work."
7453,Now for my question: Will taking medication completely change me?
7454,"One way I have always dealt with my feelings is to create music, and if taking medication will diminish or change my love of creating music then I will not take them."
7455,I meet a lot of resistance in general and I know my medications aren't sorted and I know I can't trust myself.
7456,I've been through three medications all ready and was just wondering if this is normal.
7457,"I've heard that Wellbutrin doesn't cause as much weight gain or sexual side effects, although I am terrified of meds."
7458,"I need some advice on what I should do to be a better partner, and generally a more supportive boyfriend while she struggles to get her meds right."
7459,I want to stop taking meds.
7460,"Now am running out of my trial medication and don't have a prescription for more, have been weening myself off of both the Abilify and my anti-depressants (which I was supposed to be coming off of anyways) but have not consulted my doctor or psychiatrist."
7461,TL;DR - My meds are running out.
7462,"She also knows when I am in a med change or when I haven't taken meds, she knows I have a safe song and it's on my phone, etc."
7463,Or was the psychiatrist not really sure and if that was the case were you given meds to see what works?
7464,given bipolar meds with the idea that if they didn't work maybe you weren't bipolar?
7465,"Finally, finally I was able to convince my doctor that my meds weren't working."
7466,I took way too much of my prescription meds.
7467,They took all my meds even allergy
7468,My life is totally dictated by my meds.
7469,"Things that also helped me:
I kept taking my meds, every day."
7470,"Took too many pain pills and psyc meds and poisoned myself
Didnt clean."
7471,"While I may or may not have seen the crime, I was also under deep stress, on my medications, and on pain medication for a physical injury."
7472,"I've begged my doctor for medication that will help, but she thinks I'm fine without."
7473,I vaguely remember being on meds for short periods of time.
7474,"As of February of last year, I was on 9 different meds."
7475,"I have now started two additional meds, Saphris and restarted Abilify."
7476,"Just got out of mania, falling into depression, meds dont work, its midterms week."
7477,"I can still feel traces of depression, lack of motivation, lack of energy, and drawing quick conclusions to people not liking me but something or multiple things must be working now: 1) the meds are finally helping 2) I am able to keep my head above the after if I am conscious of my mood and actions AND/OR 3) I just don't yet understand my mood changes."
7478,Before I began taking Effexor I sat down with my boyfriend of 10 months and told him I was going to begin taking a new medicine and needed his help in monitoring my behavior and to let me know if I was behaving unusually.
7479,I was prescribed some Lorazepam to take until I guess I can get in with the psychiatrist (I have scheduled an appointment for December 10) to figure out another course of medicine?
7480,Will medicine actually stabilize my moods in a way where I won’t suddenly hurt my loved ones?
7481,"So, I decided a while ago that it's time for a break from the pot to see if the meds are doing any better, but I can't figure out what to do with myself."
7482,can't get meds because i moved to a new country and am on a waiting list to see a pcp.
7483,"going to try to work out every day and try to sleep but last time i took 2 weeks off from smoking, i had meds and i still couldn't sleep or eat."
7484,I finally find a decent cocktail of meds and then find out I owe ANOTHER FUCKING $100 deductible.
7485,"I've been doing so well, I've been coping so well, my meds were helping me combat the mania and depression but this phone call put me over the edge."
7486,"I'm sick of needing meds I can't afford, even with insurance!"
7487,"I'm just trying to find a medication that works, and I'm making progress, and then *this*!"
7488,Ever since then (21 now) I've been making it without meds.
7489,"I got medicated, was ok, quit the meds, am still okay, but my old tendencies to lapse into self-loathing still haunt me."
7490,I am scred to take the medication because I heard that SSRI's without a mood stabilizer can cause a manic episode.
7491,I haven't taken my medication since November because they stopped working and I'm doing fine.
7492,"I was taking six medications, fucking six, and I still had to manage mood swings and I'm told to just  deal with it by a charlatan?"
7493,"I've started slipping up on my medicine, my sleep schedule is all over the place and I feel really weird."
7494,"She didn’t want to believe it, and refused the medications."
7495,She stopped taking her medications and smoked weed freely.
7496,"He went to a psychologist and was diagnosed as bipolar or manic depressive, but he doesn't notice his condition or think anything has changed and this refuses further counseling or any medication."
7497,"While inpatient, I couldn't smoke, couldn't drink, had to take meds exactly the way I'm supposed to and constant interaction."
7498,"I'm smoking cigs once more, had one night of drinking, and I tweaked meds a bit."
7499,Because I'm not taking meds as prescribed.
7500,"I walk home, call up the out patient doctor, leave a message telling him that I might come in tomorrow and attempt to manipulate for more meds."
7501,That I have a problem regulating medication and that I might be getting manic again.
7502,Take the medicine the way these doctors prescribe.
7503,"and I looked up the medication he gave me ... and it doesn't treat depression in bipolar, only mania."
7504,What's your input on these meds?
7505,Yesterday after going through my medical records though I think I noticed a pattern of increase suicidal thoughts since adding serotonin medications to my cocktail which makes me cautious of the fetzima.
7506,"Anyone have problems with any meds making them depressed but told my doctors ""not possible""?"
7507,"- On many different medications throughout all those years, many different cocktails."
7508,- Treated with various medications for those.
7509,"I suffered from horrible side affects while taking medications prescribed for being bipolar, and frankly, I'm terrified of ever trying medications for it again."
7510,But they've just called me to tell me that they will drop me as a patient if I don't agree to take a medication for bipolar disorder.
7511,Can I just never get help without medication?
7512,Are meds my only choice?
7513,"**TL;DR:** Doctors will drop me if I don't agree to keep trying out meds for bipolar disorder, but I'm really against taking them anymore."
7514,"In that year, I haven't missed one dose of my medication, and I didn't spend a third of that year being suicidal like the eighteen years before it!"
7515,I'm tired of being her bipolar dog she can kick when her meds aren't working.
7516,In 2012 I had a major manic episode that left me on disability for 6 months and in the hospital for 1 month and finally back on medication by early last year.
7517,"What was quite worrysome was this morning when maybe 5 mins after taking all my medicines, my stomach starts to hurt Incredibly badly, and I feel like I am  going to throw up no way out, but then i stand up and immediately i realize something is extremely wrong as my eyes feel as if they are being pressurized."
7518,"So i guess if you actually could follow, I wondered if the one or both of these meds could be causing these side effects, what the hell was with that scare, could I maybe be misdiagnosed as bipolar and the hallicinations, lack of sleep, and oddly amazing mood, a powerful body-high feeling not unlike a stimulant, and self worth(at one point i remember thinking that I wish I had somebody that recorded everything I said because everything I say is comedic gold or profound or just down right incredible compared what comes out of the majority of peoples mouths) be due to my lithium all of the sudden being the incorrect dose(even though i havent missed a single dose) or could it be a misdiagnosis all together as i had used in some form or fashion from the age of 14 to 18... and being on 1200mg lithium could perhaps be causing this state of stumulated, sense of well-being and that I actually am better than alot of people whereas usually Im quite self-depricating and depressed?"
7519,"I guess my meds are working too well, heh."
7520,Lexapro is the only medication I take that I truly feel helps me and I cannot go without it.
7521,"I have heard that there are medications out there (SSRIs) that are similar to Lexapro, such as Celexa?"
7522,I know that these are questions for my doctor but I think that someone who has actually taken these medications can offer better insight.
7523,"He took a bit of meds there, but stopped, and now only takes it when he goes to regular meetings there."
7524,He doesn't believe he needs the help or meds.
7525,"What I'd hope for is to get through that he has to most importantly stop using drugs, and secondly go on medicine."
7526,"I had some incredible highs and lows and one terrible mixed cycle for the first year but for the last 6 months I've been feeling *whelmed*

I take no medication for managing my BP1"
7527,"I feel actually somewhat alive, so obviously that has led me to have a great fear of getting the dreaded rash so i have to stop the medicine."
7528,Secondly I was curious if anyone else is getting tired of the constant micromanagement of medication dosing and side effects necessary to keep them working and stop them from becoming prohibitively problematic.
7529,"I'm talking managing blood sugar, water intake, tolerating nausea and headaches, eating enough or not too much, as well as the less obvious social side effects- whether or not you can drink on them, whether they make you antisocial or not, or the extreme example- not knowing if the medication is making a close relatives death affect you significantly less."
7530,What medications have been helpful to some of you?
7531,"When she described shit bird's antics the cop said ""ohhh, he's bipolar and off his meds""."
7532,"When I was 14 my psychiatrist started prescribing non ADHD meds for ""symptoms"" without a new diagnosis (supposedly to protect me in case I wanted to join the military)."
7533,How do I get her to get off the meds.
7534,I take a lot of medicines for a variety of things.
7535,"So, first let me say that I haven't been to see a professional (yet) because I am afraid that they will say I am crazy and either institutionalize me for a bit (for observation) or they will give me some meds that will fuck me up more than I already am."
7536,They don't realize that if I was on anti-depressants or any kind of medication I'd be required to take it every day.
7537,So far the medicine is not making any noticeable changes to my mood but I've taken enough meds in my life to know it can take a while (especially considering I'm just entering the effective range and am a heavier guy).
7538,i moved into a new place this week and temporarily lost my meds packed up somewhere.
7539,I don't have meds.
7540,"I'm trying to get him to take his medication, in what I think is a polite and respectful manner and tone, but he always screams at me and says that I'm the ""crazy one"" (even though I never use that term to him)."
7541,Does anyone else ever get the feeling that all the meds they take might be poisoning them?
7542,"I'm strongly considering stopping all of my meds and going back to smoking weed again, despite the fact that it could cost me my job."
7543,(I can provide a list of meds for comparison if that would help.)
7544,Does anyone else feel like their meds are a gigantic ball and chain?
7545,"*Just to be clear, I'm taking my medication and not looking for alternative medicinal treatments... just some advice about what works for you guys."
7546,A little over three years ago I decided to get clean from both alcohol and prescription pain medication.
7547,I'd like to note that I was also on about six different medications taking about 11 pills a day all prescribed by my doctor for various ailments.
7548,"I spent the next three months weaning off all the meds, while my shrink started figuring out which ones to use for my real disease."
7549,I now take a single medicine twice a day.
7550,"I have medication, and I've been taking it for awhile, and had it increased and changed and in all honesty: I could just drink the water with no pills and I'd probably feel the same as always."
7551,Luckily now I'm on medication but it doesn't feel any better.
7552,I am wondering if my husband may have a mental illness and another poster on reddit was describing what her husband is like off his meds and it fit my husband perfectly.
7553,"I have been off meds for 7 months, and I'm handling myself well."
7554,"But till this day i still have to deal with the anger issues that still persists even after three months of taking my medication, and i realize that playing video games are one of my main triggers of having the mania."
7555,"At the time, I was on 2 meds, Lexapro and Provigil."
7556,My meds stopped working my senior year.
7557,"Not much, but I've used it to see a doctor and buy medicine out of pocket."
7558,So I've been working with my therapist on trying some cbt therapy to help along with medication.
7559,"I'm in a really dark place and I know going through the process of finding a new therapist I trust, on my own, who will give me the right meds and is taking new patients will take longer than I can hold out."
7560,I don't care about meds or therapy.
7561,I don't care about trying to research ways to get my meds or psychiatrist appointments for cheaper.
7562,My husband was overseas at the time so it was left to me to determine if the medicine was working well.
7563,"I thought the medicine was fine, made the switch and have been on it for a month."
7564,What I am getting at is how do you go about finding a good doctor and getting on some meds?
7565,Will the meds screw me up as bad as i'm afraid they will?
7566,Im an aspiring stand up comic and have heard that meds can muddle the thought process if this is true it could spell the end of a life long dream.
7567,I've been taking medication for a few months now and I'm still easily agitated by things such as my parents.
7568,"**Questions**

* Why is this happening when I'm taking medication?"
7569,I've been off meds for several months and I'm waiting to get in to see a new pdoc to get back on them ASAP.
7570,"If you're on medication, do you still get episodes, they just aren't as intense?"
7571,I've been medication free (and out of treatment entirely) for over a year.
7572,"Had I stayed with my initial psychiatrist I would probably still be on medication--and worse, medication that wouldn't have helped my particular condition."
7573,This medication would have probably greatly altered my personality and physical appearance in ways that I don't even want to contemplate.
7574,Don't stop your medications.
7575,In some ways it would be easier for me to accept that I needs meds if I was psychotic or had some other symptom I couldn't rationally control.
7576,"Lots of them like to boast about how exercise, good nutrition, and not taking any medicine or medication is all it takes to be happy and even."
7577,I think they judge me for taking medicine too.
7578,"In that time he has moved like four hundred miles away, cut his patient interaction time to less than ten minutes per session, failed to check whether my dosage for my meds is even in a therapeutic range."
7579,"My meds were lithium, Serzone, and Xanax."
7580,"In '97, i lost my insurance and thus my meds."
7581,Couldn't afford meds so i stayed unmedicated until 2002.
7582,They provided meds for a few months but county mental health cost more than i could afford.
7583,So again no meds.
7584,I went to community health for my bipolar and i can get seen and get my meds.
7585,"I'm on a lengthy list of meds, many just to soothe the side effects of others."
7586,"And I am starting to consider taking meds until I feel like my life is not so full of messy, unmanageable things."
7587,"I guess I'll get right to the point: Do you think it would be a good idea to type up a card with a list of the meds I'm on, my allergies, etc."
7588,"Hey guys, about a month ago my medication was changed to Quetiapine XL 50mg."
7589,Has anybody else had this experience as I'm wondering if it has something to do with the medication or if its just pure coincidence?
7590,They are working the medication to try and get things right for her but so far no luck.
7591,"Psych meds, weight gain."
7592,"My head is a mess, I don't know if I should go ask for medication or if I should talk to someone, it just seems that every time I've talked to someone I get shut out."
7593,she went from super depressed to the meds making her manic and depressed at the same time.
7594,I am not on meds.
7595,ive been on and off lithium so much that im tired of the rollercoaster ride of trying to take medication then end up thinking im fine and stop then doing it all over again.
7596,i cant tell if the medications i am on are helping or making things worse which doesnt help the hopelessness feelings.
7597,I can't get medication and I can't see my doctor anymore because my mother cancelled my insurance.
7598,i don't take medication due to the fact that for one...it makes me feel like i'm crazy (currently prescribed abilify and effexor) and i don't think i am...also i like to horde pills because it makes me feel better knowing i have that easy way out if anything.
7599,"I felt at peace, like everything was going to be ok. On a whim I dug through my drawer and found a handful of a migraine meds that were a mix of caffeine, aspirin, and barbiturate."
7600,In this process they wrecked my meds and changed everything.
7601,I've said fuck it and take the meds I know work for me.
7602,"I have money for meds, a good therapist, and a stable enough home environment to cater to/support me in any mood swing that I am having."
7603,I'm starting to really stabilize with the meds im on and its just been wonderful.
7604,"That being said its time I start help us out, so I want to know what I need to do/major in to get into researching and testing treatments or medicines out for bipolar."
7605,"I told her I don't think I have extreme manic phases, but she said it is actually a spectrum (which I didn't realise) and that it would be helpful if it meant I could get some medication which would help stabilise me."
7606,"My dilemma is that I completely agree - if there is medication that can help me, I will take it in a heartbeat."
7607,"I just don't know what to do - I feel like if I have an assessment and it turns out I am diagnosed, it could potentially offer me medication to make life bearable which could change my life for the better."
7608,It's like I haven't taken my ADHD meds at all except when it's time to sleep and I can't fucking sleep!
7609,"I am generally pretty stable these days, although I do not take medication as I find it intellectually limiting which is a very important factor for me, (Psychology and philosophy degrees, working on engineering)."
7610,"Its the damn meds I'm on, puts me to sleep but doesn't help anything else."
7611,To begin with I'll be going off my meds.
7612,"I stopped all of my medication a month ago or so, maybe two months at most."
7613,I got back to my psychiatrist tomorrow and will tell him all of this and get back on meds.
7614,I really like the idea of a once a month medicine though.
7615,I am dealing with the side effects of these medications trying to become stable.
7616,"I have to balance the good for the bad, changing my medication is always risky and this time the medication that helped me control psychotic anger outbursts is causing sleep problems, I used to sleep 6 hours now I sleep 10 but I still can’t fall asleep at night, along with causing my already poor ability to focus to be worse."
7617,"I can't even start taking the proper medication until I get home, which is almost a year from now."
7618,"He shows a lot of symptoms for depression, but my family is so into modern medicine that they don't listen to me when I suggest that he talks to a psychologist to try to sort his issues out."
7619,"I'm probably being petty, but I feel distressed over it because I feel like I look like a bumbling moron these days, very unlike how I used to be pre-medication."
7620,I know that others on here have felt similarly about having their cognition affected by bipolar medication.
7621,I have chosen to deal with my bipolar disorder without the aid of medication.
7622,"http://www.amazon.com/Surviving-Manic-Depressi…/…/0465086640
Great read if you want to better understand symptons and medication options."
7623,"After 15 years of mood swings, 5 hospitalizations, and more meds attempted than I can list, I'm giving up."
7624,"In the weeks prior and right up til day one of vacation though I was hypomanic (to the point that my psychiatrist increased my meds, though I haven't started the higher dose yet)."
7625,"My meds have really helped me, and I am doing better than I thought I would be doing (Lithium 900mg)."
7626,"My psychiatrist has never mentioned them, but I just started seeing her and have only been on my current medications for a month."
7627,Anyone else here going it alone without meds?
7628,"Please, I'm not looking for rational to take my meds, instead interested if anyone else is able to cope without them."
7629,"I was diagnosed about 15 years ago, qualified for disability (SSD) on the first try 8 years ago, and stopped seeing a Pdoc and taking their meds about 2 years ago."
7630,"I just have to avoid doing something that lands me in jail or kicked out of my current living situation, both of which have happened in the past while ""on my meds""."
7631,"Basically I'd rather experience the cycles (ie, my life) as it happens rather than constantly assessing my mood and the adequacy of the meds."
7632,Note that I would whole heartedly recommend therapy and meds to anyone newly diagnosed.
7633,I took stimulant meds.
7634,I guess I'm here to talk with you about this and to question about the medication.
7635,"What meds do you take for bipolar, and how do they affect you?"
7636,So far I have gone through about eight or nine different medications and nothing has worked so far.
7637,"Not taking any meds right now, they stopped working and the other ones had weird effects on my body."
7638,"School was a mess this semester, couldn't keep focus and meds wore off, so that just screwed everything up."
7639,The Seroquel is doing it's job and I am coming down from the mania and the depression medicine is working and the depression is slowly disappearing.
7640,The only change in meds was upping my ADHD medication.
7641,Raised it to 200 a week ago and I'm just as depressed as I was before any medication.
7642,"I'm taking my medication, despite the fact that it has made me incredibly stupid."
7643,For about two weeks I basically couldn't function despite being on medication for over a year now - 200mg Lamictal.
7644,"She wanted to change my medication to Depakote, but changing medications takes a long time, and I don't think I can make it through without losing my job, or losing hours and not being able to pay rent."
7645,"He made me feel wanted, even though I had gained *fifty* pounds from the hefty (10x the normal) dosage of HORRIBLE bipolar medicine."
7646,"I was edging off the horrible medicine, and losing weight rapidly."
7647,"He deals with a lot of shit that normal people wouldn't, and often reminds me to take my medicine and helps me calm down (I have an anxiety disorder as well)."
7648,"He was rewarded with the real me, who came out of hiding after finding a stable psychiatrist in my new college town, and medicine that doesn't make me feel like a zombie."
7649,"Although the thought of taking medication for the rest of my life is one that I am not comfortable enough accepting yet, I am glad that at present I am getting treatment and tackling life in a healthy way, rather than by waiting for one of my highly-productive manic phases to kick in."
7650,"I am an unmedicated bi-polar II sufferer and trying to keep myself from ending up in the fucking psych ward again, I have no insurance and can't afford the meds as I can barely manage to work enough to pay my rent."
7651,"no one should have to live like this, but no one wants to really help me...  My employer doesn't offer health insurance, i make too much to get medicaid, but not enough to afford obamacare and my dr appts and meds trying to pay for them on my own is more than i make in a month...  i am tired of the struggle."
7652,is Not taking medication an option?
7653,"I wish I could magically take my meds and feel better in half an hour, like it's Tylenol for a headache..."
7654,"So far, so good, but I have a long history of medicines not being positive for me after some time, so I'm a littler nervous."
7655,"It took a lot of time, patience, educating myself about medications, and finding doctors who are open to discussion of what may or may not be the best thing to try, but I finally got myself on a decent meds cocktail."
7656,I realized that one of the big reasons I think a lot of  bipolars quit taking meds is because they miss the manic high (which I have compared to the best drug high anyone could ever have) and feel they need it to live and be creative.
7657,"I was off meds, and everything was going well, then something triggered me and for about 6 weeks I absolutely lost my mind."
7658,"Back on medication, I still feel like I'm hypomanic, but it's under control and I'm obsessing over hobbies rather than relationship trauma and betrayal."
7659,I'm sure that this question is asked all the time but I'd like to know what meds have worked best for y'all.
7660,I understand that meds vary from person to person but I guess I'd like to hear how certain meds make you feel and such.
7661,"My Bipolar/PTSD spun out of control (after foolishly running out of my medication and school/my daughter taking up all my time so I couldn't meet up at an appointment)....and it got to an extreme, leaving me no choice but to get out of my apartment."
7662,"If it weren't for the sleeping medication they gave me, I would be a wreck....they had to start giving it to me while in the hospital, because at night I thought/think a lot about what horrors could have taken place....and the guilt gives me nightmares."
7663,The symptoms are generally well controlled though medication (i.e.
7664,My shrink thinks adding more meds to sedate me is the answer.....
7665,But my therapist says the meds have changed me more than any of my disorders and before the meds i was never in need of hospitalization.
7666,"2- while to a point my medication doses are the way they are so I can play with them and adjust as needed, but it seems dropping my dose low and supplementing with lorazepam if needed and then increasing up again and such with weird amounts of sleep is a shitty idea."
7667,Could this be a result of my medication?
7668,Could a medication change be the solution?
7669,"I feel like I'm slowly getting everything in my life put together, my meds are working, I've got plans and steps and goals."
7670,How is alcohol with these meds?
7671,"Also, who else is on these meds?"
7672,"I struggled with it and eventually decided to take the path without medication, using CBT to help me control my problems."
7673,"I really want to avoid medication if I can, because the 3 different things I tried in the beginning really made me feel awful."
7674,"Do they try different meds on you in rapid succession, while monitoring your reactions?"
7675,"I have *not* found an acceptable medication regimen yet, and since the diagnosis, I have progressed into ultra-rapid cycling."
7676,"I am new to this medication...I have never been diagnosed before, but I am so happy that I now have an answer to the ""why?"
7677,"My meds are only helping so much, but I'm still fucking up shit."
7678,"my meds have been settled down to lamictal, adderall and risperdal, and i'm certainly more grounded in reality as a result, but still feel like a zombie that's not capable of doing anything anymore."
7679,Which means I have no money to see a doctor or get the medications I'm normally on.
7680,I've been off meds for over three months and I'm worried that this will be a pretty big/long episode because of that.
7681,"The meds are working, I don't need to go to therapy anymore, and until maybe twenty minutes ago I was handling the diagnosis pretty well."
7682,"So I told my shrink this and he said it was textbook ""High phase"" and he wants my meds tweeked to alleviate this from happening in the future."
7683,She was diagnosed and put on medications.
7684,Through conversation she admitted to me that she had stopped taking her medication.
7685,"While that was untrue, I figured the mood swings were slight and I know the medication is not perfect, so I attributed it to that."
7686,My back is hurting from doing too much while hypo (thus the pain meds) and focalin for ADHD.
7687,** Not only that but those who write these blogs say that medication that they've taken for **ONE WHOLE DAY** is stupid and doesn't work and cripples them and it's not the one they need.
7688,Man I would marry my meds if I could.
7689,"I would buy them a ring and get down on one knee and propose, goddamn they are my saving grace (sorry family you are amazing but damn these meds just get me) Now I'm not saying it's easy, it's hard to find a combination of drugs that fit together and work for you and if you've found that combination then you know exactly how I feel."
7690,"It's been a while since I've posted here, but I'm in a bad place right now and want some advice on whether I should talk to my psych about possibly adding another medication to the Latuda I'm currently taking."
7691,I'm wondering if my latuda stopped working or if I should talk to my doctor about adding another medication to it.
7692,But I don't to start a new medication.
7693,I've learned that it is best to combine therapy (which I have been doing on and off since I was a child) and medication.
7694,"It's like the meds are finally working

FTR: Lamictal 200mg, Zoloft 50mg"
7695,Then when I was 13 I found out that my dad had to take medicine for bipolar depression which I really didn't understand but I googled it and thought about how hard it must be to live with that.
7696,I'm at a near total loss at this time because I can't even afford my own damn medication for my condition.......
7697,"I know she takes medication for something, and has not corrected me when in passing I have mentioned her bipolar, so I suspect this is the case."
7698,I'm so afraid that I will be dumber or less creative if I kill the mania all together with medication.
7699,She was on meds for about 7 years.. and just up and stopped them at 21.. she is almost 23 now.
7700,"I have settled into a really stable routine surrounding many aspects of my health, like medication, nutrition, exercise, avoiding drugs and moderating alcohol."
7701,(I have not yet sought out a diagnosis because I lack medical care and it isn't really an option as of right now as appointments and meds will be more than I can likely afford.
7702,I dont take medication either..
7703,"I've also been fairly depressed recently, so lack of motivation and all came with it, but I assume this is not a medication related problem as it should take 7-10 days to kick in, right?"
7704,"I'm on meds but honestly they're not very effective, I've tried everything and what I'm on is useless."
7705,"I'm hoping I will screw everything up soon so everything will just stop.and hospitalization is useless too, because they just medicate you when I'm already trying meds as it is..."
7706,I have been taking my meds regularly and working on CBT at home since there are no providor in my network who uses it.
7707,"Before I went back on my meds I was super depressed and figured my unhappiness in the relationship was due to the overwhleming saddness that was eating at me, not the fact that things just weren't work."
7708,"I was previously on respirdal and lamictal, but I've been off meds since July."
7709,"Since I've been off meds, I've been in situations that I know would've plunged me into a pit of depression and suicidal thoughts in the past, but I've managed to prevent that because I've gotten really good at handling my emotions and stopping my disordered thoughts before they've festered and fucked me up."
7710,"I don't feel like I'm in a precarious place since, like I said, I've dealt with a lot of shit since being off meds and I've managed fine, but I don't want to potentially ruin the good state I've been in for the past 8 months just for an afternoon of drug-induced fun with friends."
7711,I had lost faith in my psychs who were unable to find meds that did anything more than make me manic then crash harder than before.
7712,"Wound up manic and had my first suicide attempt 8 months later) (Started cutting when I was 17) 

* Abilify
* My first psych from when I was 15 was re-assigned to me by the first psych unit by luck) She quickly added the following meds to the mix: Seroquel (600MG), Lamictial (200MG), Trazodone (20mg) and another one I can't remember anymore."
7713,"I quickly dropped all the meds (mostly because the cost ($1800 a month), and the fact it was making me unable to do anything."
7714,* early 2012 I was playing the let's try meds game again.
7715,My doctor had lost all rights to prescribe me meds after all his various attempts made me super manic (there was the whole prozac incident in 2011 that I can't remember when + the amtryptaline).
7716,Then I'm going to probably check myself back into the hospital and fight to get in for longer than a week to make sure meds will actually work and just not make me manic again.
7717,I'm quickly running out of meds to try.
7718,"He doesn't seem comfortable with diagnosing me with ANYTHING without a second opinion, but he's told me that a lot of what I've said fits the bill for bipolar or at least severe depression, and that I'd be a good candidate for medication to, quote, ""end the suffering."""
7719,My girlfriend of nearly a year is bipolar and every now and then even when taking her meds her mood will shift which i am entirely used to.
7720,"I've been paying meds, Pdr, and therapist myself, along with the help from the city human resources."
7721,"I stopped taking the medication, but after a really poor semester my freshman year of college I had my family physician put me on Adderall."
7722,"I responded to that medication well for the next two years, but this year I found that it triggered episodes of depression when the drug wore off."
7723,"I talked with a therapist who readily agreed with my assessment, and encouraged me to find a psychiatrist to put me on medication and possibly recommend I take a leave of absence from school."
7724,"I could use some help with picking a medication to use, because all I do right now is drink and smoke weed to stabilize myself."
7725,anyone have success in losing weight while still on meds.
7726,I'm not on the meds that I gained weight on but my psych and therapist said that my current meds may be preventing me from losing the weight.
7727,"current meds: Deplin, cymbalta, xanax, buspar, treximet, hyoscyamine, dexilant and doxepin."
7728,"I'm normally pretty balanced, especially with my meds, but not today."
7729,"They:

* drink while on meds, or skip days of meds so that they can drink more 
* eat very poorly, tons of fast food and sugar, almost no fruits or veggies at all
*  skip doctors' appointments and avoid regular therapy
* refuse to exercise or diet and use meds as an excuse for weight gain (OK granted some are pretty bad but a lot of it is from being sedentary)

Anyways you get the picture."
7730,"The alcohol and irregular meds, I feel, is the worst."
7731,"I feel like using meds in that way (3 or 4 days a week, drink both weekend nights) is worse than just not taking any at all."
7732,He doesn't know I started taking meds again.
7733,I just got put on this medicine to treat PTSD and OCD comorbid with schizoaffective.
7734,Any experiences with this medicine good or bad?
7735,"Anyway, I can't get appointments for regular therapy or a consultation with a psychiatrist for medication until January."
7736,"Her husband has tried to get her treatment, but she refuses to take meds."
7737,"So, I'm wondering:

1) Does anyone have advice on how we can get her treated if she refuses medication?"
7738,"Diagnosed Bipolar 6 months ago, wasn't able to continue treatment or get on any medication due to financial difficulties."
7739,but I don't take any meds for that.
7740,"She downright refuses to let my mom take her to the doctors for any type of medicine, or even just someone she can talk to and vent her frustrations."
7741,We got her to go see a doctor about medication once.
7742,"When your meds are under control, do you still have up and downs or are you completely stable?"
7743,"(medication, therapy, ECT, group etc."
7744,Bad medicines.
7745,Her horrid Kaiser doctor doesn't seem to know what meds she's on half the time.
7746,I know that's the state of modern psychiatric medicine but I'm more afraid of what the new meds will do.
7747,"So yes I am mentally ill, but I do take my prescribed medications."
7748,I'm just doing cognitive behavioral therapy since late summer 2012 and have endured bipolarity type 2 without ever trying any meds.
7749,Me and my therapist are trying to find out why i'm so hard towards myself and opposing any medications.
7750,Don't get me wrong: There were depressive cicles where i just begged for them and within the next days up to the next session I was back opposing medication hard.
7751,Any different medication beside Lithium I should ask my MD and therapist about?
7752,I told him again that the medication was causing problems and he UPPED THE DOSE.
7753,Instead I have medication that makes me crazy and a doctor who won't listen to me.
7754,"It's like he stopped listening at bipolar and is fixating on treating bipolar mania, which I hardly experienced before these new medications."
7755,It took until today for me to realize my meds are off.
7756,Do you take medication?
7757,I've been off my meds for about three weeks now.
7758,"In the three weeks I've been off meds, I noticed the racing thoughts coming back, especially at night when I was trying to sleep."
7759,"Can't deal with this sickness, the struggle is too much, can't afford meds, i'm broken, my life is a complete disaster, last 6 months were even worse."
7760,"While I'm currently taking medicine on a strict schedule (lithium and seroquel) as well as performing at my new job for almost a year straight, I can't seem to stop drinking."
7761,"Yes I am legitimately diagnosed with bipolar disorder with schizoaffective disorder, I am on medication, no my parents are not people I can turn to and say how I'm feeling."
7762,"I refused meds from my pdoc back in Janurary, he told me to come back."
7763,I know that doing so will counteract my meds.
7764,I feel like its that part of me that wants to stop taking meds and off myself; that darker part of me.
7765,My doctor is switching me from Ablify to Brintellix which he says is a very new medication.
7766,I get a little scared to start new medications.
7767,I don't think I can handle day to day life without self medication and liquor.
7768,"I truly wish I could find the meds that some people have on here that make them feel ""emotionally numb."""
7769,"Drastically, no-time-to-titrate meds slowly up or down bad but IT'S A THANKSGIVING MIRACLE!"
7770,"I got my diagnosis about two months ago and been on meds ever since, but I still feel like dying."
7771,"Therapist asked me if I would be okay with going on medication today, yesterday I was raging and feeling homicidal and really wanted them, today I'm depressed and am worried about what would happen if I take meds, I don't want all my emotions to be shut off, and sometimes I really like the manic cycles."
7772,"Hi all, I am looking for a new doctor and would like to change medications, but I have no idea where to start."
7773,Im fairly sure I wouldn’t have any of these things if I didn’t just accept it and go on meds.
7774,"Despite all the meds I am currently on, the tics remain."
7775,And I respect that it all came from sucking it up and going on medication.
7776,"I know it takes some time for the meds to kick in and people tell me to hang on, but this pain is too much."
7777,None of my current meds target serotonin specifically.
7778,From the age of 16 I knew I was depressed and I was on medication for it Welbutrin).
7779,I quit taking medication again shortly after and slid back into doing drugs.
7780,"Anyway, just over a year later, on medication and doing great."
7781,"ok, the meds are kicking inand i'm falling aslelep."
7782,"Oh, I also have this stigma against these mood-altering medicines."
7783,"I'm afraid of side effects and over-dependence on it, and besides, I doubt I have it bad enough that I should need to take any medication."
7784,They hospital gave me sleeping medication but it just isn't working.
7785,It does not play nice with our meds.
7786,Last night he throws it in my face that I am on meds.
7787,"There's also the mention of how when people feel fine it's kind of risky because all therapy/meds/preemptive measures may be thrown out the window and then, well, you swing up and down again."
7788,"The medicine will kill the misery dead, will silence the wailing and smother the bells that ring inside your head."
7789,"It's &gt;impossible to know how much of this stuff is me and how much is &gt;induced by the meds... 
&gt;
&gt;ideally I want to discover that med free is easier on most levels..."
7790,I've been on and off meds for several years.
7791,He's kind and gentle unless he forgets his meds.
7792,then he's irritable and snotty and we yell at each other til he shuts the hell up and gets his meds.
7793,I'm finally starting to come out of the insane Bipolar depression now that I'm getting back on meds and such.
7794,I can't find a psychiatrist to prescribe me new meds who will take my insurance.
7795,Sorry if this is a scatter-brained post but I'm really doped up on meds right now..
7796,"The symptoms are manageable, sometimes.... mainly due to meds."
7797,"Also, I should add the meds block my personality and thoughts as well."
7798,"I'm on lithium, but my doctor have said I will probably need a combination of meds to get me as stable as possible."
7799,She had a doctor who put her in anti depressants and anti anxiety medicine when she was depressed but she didn't take it or see the doctor for long.
7800,"I've been on medication for it before but stopped when I was unable to pay for the medication anymore (I was in college, on my own, and it costs like $200)."
7801,"And how, since I have insurance again, If there was any medication for bipolar and anxiety that are preggo safe."
7802,"I would be more than thrilled if I can do this without medication, but I have spent the past four days crying off and on over basically nothing."
7803,"And the therapist said she could refer me for medication, but I want to at least try therapy first."
7804,I am deciding to fuck going to my psychiatrist tomorrow and stop taking my meds (I have been slowly decreasing my dosage over the last week) and I also am feeling a little manic.
7805,"Haven't seen my doc in a while, she wanted a drug test, mainly for adhd meds I was taking last year, but I just hate those tests and haven't gone in."
7806,So there weren't much use for medication.
7807,I've tried quite a few types of medicine but did not have much success with them.
7808,"I either started to feel all emotionally numb and without passion, or they gave me with unpleasant side effects which, combined with the fact that I dislike the thought of medicine, lead to me stop taking it."
7809,"Last time I really gave medication a try, and told myself that I needed it, was with the mindset that I had to because I was ""sick and wrong""."
7810,I was not ready to start taking medication back then.
7811,I got such many doubts about medication.
7812,"Also they have started me on new meds and I don't feel any different, is that normal?"
7813,"Up until I got on the right meds, I seemed to start the spiral into mania every November like clockwork."
7814,Are my meds finally losing their magic?
7815,"I absolutely hate the meds, but I've done really well on my current cocktail."
7816,"With the medication, I'm happy to say that I see flashes of the color coming back."
7817,"Not many people say this about life, about what they are looking forward to when it comes to medication, but I can't wait to laugh again."
7818,"My psychiatrists said they never expected them to because I didn't have clinical depression, I was bipolar, and either legally or through my insurance, whatever, they could not prescribe medications to treat bipolar for anyone under 18."
7819,We tried changing my meds half a dozen times to no avail.
7820,I'd love to hear from anyone who has successfully overcome the delusional aspect of the disorder and come back to a happy productive life on meds.
7821,"My doc had left town and I was supposed to find a new one for meds, but I hadn't."
7822,I'm currently not in a position in which I can get meds.
7823,I started medication for the first time this week.
7824,I recently stopped taking medication (bad idea on my part....) but I do believe this is only a further step to getting better.
7825,"When im on my meds im not depressed too much other than just general apathy, but i never go manic."
7826,"I work out, take medication, and try to sleep as well as I can."
7827,"The meds are helping, but of course still have issues."
7828,I'm on medication and I go to therapy.
7829,I am also wondering if my medicine is making me a little TOO numb.
7830,Any one else have experience with cheating SOs and medication numbing effects?
7831,I struggle with alcohol as a means of self medication.
7832,"Be prepared from Drake (he's a hallucination), get 9 hours of sleep at night, do not take a mess of meds at one time (no self medicating)."
7833,"I hate the idea of medication of youth unless absolutely necessary (due to the fact that most psychotropic meds have not been clinically tested on children or adolescents, yet often have very different interactions with the underage brain), but I'm agreeing to the Welbutrin because a)it isn't an SSRI, and b) nothing else is working and I can't stand around and watch him deteriorate further."
7834,So at the moment we are in the phase where we are trying to get my meds to the correct dosage.
7835,I’m not happy being on the meds but the doctor said just like my dad I will get brain damage due to the fact of the mania that releases to much dopamine which literally fries my brain and that leads to brain damage.
7836,"I spent 7 years without medication, and was doing really well!"
7837,"I spent some time in hospital to get some meds sorted, started therapy again and had a wonderful husband who supported me through all of it."
7838,"The only meds I have found that quash the hypersexuality force me into a depression, so I can't see that working out too well for my doctors."
7839,I slipped the medicine she refused to take in her food and coffee.
7840,She began to take her meds and decided she wanted to return to Vancouver – and me.
7841,"My current meds: Seroquel (150 mg at bedtime), Lamictal (100 mg every morning), and Klonopin (1 mg up to 4 times a day)."
7842,"**edit: added more ranting so tw for brief mention of self-harm**

i've been under a lot of stress from school and my family lately in addition to a weeklong streak of not taking my meds out of laziness and despair."
7843,"I was doing a lot of spiritual practices at the time and having suspected the psychiatrist had no idea what he was talking about, I went off my meds a week after getting out of the hospital."
7844,I am completely off all meds now even though my doc said I would lose it and wouldn't come back to reality if I ever went off them.
7845,I believe this is due to medication because if I skip a day of meds the sensation goes away.
7846,"It really makes me want to quit my medication, I feel like this could possibly be giving me nerve damage or neurological damage."
7847,I know I should probably just try another medication but I just can't believe that taking something that affects your brain everyday won't have some sort of consequence on your brain or body.
7848,So basically all medication scares me because of the possible mind crippling side effects.
7849,My girlfriend is very much opposed to me going off my medication because she can barely stand me when I'm depressed or manic and cried when I told her I didn't want to be on my medication anymore.
7850,Should I go off my meds?
7851,Have any of you successfully gone off meds and found a way to live a balanced life?
7852,Any tips for staying balanced while off my meds?
7853,She also said she would go back to the doctor and ask if she can be put back on medication as she refused medication in the past.
7854,"I do in a sense enjoy the ""stability"" that my medication offers but I feel too NORMAL now."
7855,"Is this medication just not the right one for me, or does it take a while to take effect?"
7856,My meds reduced the amount of attacks I get significantly.
7857,But my meds helped reducing the suicidal thoughts.
7858,What none of the meds help is my afraidness of the future.
7859,"Now that I'm on meds again and I've had the chance to look back, I'm sad."
7860,I was recently put on Adderall to see how it affects me (because I am usually in a very low depression rather than manic phase) after no success with other medication.
7861,"I stopped taking my meds last summer, which included depakote."
7862,"Really, it was my psychologist who convinced me and helped me to find a doctor to prescribe me medications."
7863,"I'm taking my medication correctly, I'm exercising 5 times a week, I cut out alcohol, I lost 25 pounds and I'm at a normal weight, I eat healthy, I have a regular sleep schedule, I take multi-vitamins, I try to socialize everyday and I got a pet because I read that it helps with depression."
7864,"So a little backstory: I was diagnosed two years ago (though my symptoms started about a decade ago, as a teenager), and it took me some time to get on the right meds &amp; dosages of said meds, but I've been stable for months now (yay!)."
7865,"I'm definitely going to mention it to my psychiatrist, but I'm not sure if she can do much since my medications have been balancing me out quite well as of lately...maybe talk to a therapist?"
7866,"This is mostly in relation to finding the right medication but also just in general... getting better, being ok enough to get a job, or else it being ok for you to NOT have a job in this modern society..."
7867,"If so, I think it's safe to say that what you are currently experiencing anger at the audacity of such a definitive ""label"" slapped on you, fear and distrust of the medications and side effects (not to mention the very idea of taking them for the rest of your life), and perhaps most painful of all, the idea that these things will steal away that which makes you, *you."
7868,"I would agree to try the medication, with the understanding that I would be in control."
7869,"* 

It took a long time to slowly titrate up enough to feel the effects of the medication, but I stuck with them."
7870,"I an unmedicated, except for anxiety medication."
7871,"I have been off bd meds for over a year, and not by choice, so please don't lecture me on that."
7872,I've been off medication for a year and I just hit the 2 week point of having started again.
7873,I'm self medicating at this point too by taking high dosages of whatever I've been able to find in my medicine cabinet.
7874,The only thing different in my life is my meds (I was non-compliant with meds until last year.)
7875,"I went through like, seven different fucking medicines from april to the end of july, and i took saphris from the end of july to middle of august."
7876,"My mom only bitches at me to do shit, my dad is going through extreme medicine changes and is going out on disability again and he's doing in-patient treatment this time."
7877,Been traveling so haven't started any meds.
7878,"I find it so much easier to be single, because the constant paranoia I feel (goes away only when I take meds, which I'm not on right now) shifts away from outlandish conspiracies against me to the myriad of terrible things happening to my SO."
7879,"so i know that the obvious solution is to get back on a tranquilizer, but i am wondering if any of you are currently living without medications."
7880,"right now my meds are okay, except for the mania of course, but i am wondering if i will be able to ride this one out."
7881,there is never going to be a time when i am supported in coming off of medications.
7882,"like i said, right now i am just seeing if can ride this out or if i will have to go back on my meds."
7883,"This time he wound up in jail for a month and then after that the family took care of him and were able to convince him to see a therapist and to take his medication, abstain from marijuana, etc."
7884,"for some reason, the fact i can maintain a job makes me feel like im not 'bipolar enough' 
 for example, during a particlarly up week lately, i stole some money from my work which i then spent on otc medicine."
7885,I've been on and off medication since now because I had struggled to come to grips that I actually have a disease that needs to be treated and taken seriously.
7886,I didn't get into the psychiatrist to talk about meds until 2 months after that initial appointment.
7887,"Now, my daughter and I go to the same practice (family medicine)."
7888,"We later went back to the main doctor of the practice and he apologized for her behavior, but he wasn't willing to write out something saying he ""okayed"" me taking the meds while BFing for my Psychiatrist because lack of research."
7889,Lately I have been having more issues with anger and I know I need to get back on meds.
7890,She has her 12 month appointment next week and I want to go in there with research on several medication options for the doc to look at.
7891,"I'm hoping that by showing the research on several options, showing that I'm attempting to mostly wean (so she wouldn't be taking in much of the medication), and willingness to have her tested to make sure it's not affecting her, that he might finally write that note."
7892,"It's especially important that I get on meds as well because, if any of you *have* BFed and weaned before, you know that weaning causes havoc to your hormones and causes major mood swings, which I know I won't be able to ""handle"" unmedicated."
7893,"So, my question to you:  Who here has taken meds while BFing."
7894,What meds do you recommend?
7895,Did/Does anyone go through this with these meds?
7896,Did you switch to other meds and have noticed a major change?
7897,I also worry that I might have to go off my meds during pregnancy and fall into depression or mania.
7898,Stopped taking my medications about 3 days ago.
7899,On all of that today i woke up feeling pretty anxious probably because i stop taking my meds i am on lexapro and seroquel and hydroxyzine for anxiety(doesn't work at all).
7900,Could this be because of the meds or due to the fact that im under alot of stress of repeating another year of school.
7901,"So for years off and on, I've taken antianxiety, antidepressant, and sleep medication to manage the symptoms but I saw a new psychiatrist today who is prescribing me Tegretol as a mood stabilizer."
7902,I've been frustrated with my meds for a long time.
7903,I don't want to be on a bunch of things but I can't seem to get it through to her that the current meds aren't working.
7904,"My thyroid levels were on the low side of normal, but not enough to warrant medication, as of January."
7905,"They have cut my hours from 25 to 10, make completely unveiled jokes like "" oh, I mucked that up, I'll blame my pills"" ( just had a major medication change so I made mention that it was making me lightheaded)  when I'm
In the room."
7906,"My cycling was getting out of control again for the first time in two years, and my pdoc wanted me to take time off to focus on adjusting my meds and get help through a partial hospitalization program."
7907,I'm not on meds or seeing my doctor but I'm doing everything I can to get back to that.
7908,"This is why I'm off meds, etc."
7909,I need my meds adjusted.
7910,"The meds I'm on have kept me from slipping into depression, but the intrusive thoughts have become overwhelming, I'm giving up........."
7911,I was reaching a clear phase and slipped on my meds.
7912,"I have not been forgetting my meds, though I have been smoking weed and drinking, which usually isn't a problem."
7913,I've been off my meds for about a year and some change now.
7914,Does anyone have any experience at all with getting off this medication?
7915,I know a lot of people on here are not going to agree with my reasoning to stop taking my meds (especially the way I stopped them) but one day I woke up and just felt too.. stable.
7916,"With my ptsd I still occasionally (if the right circumstance brings it up) will have panic attacks or flashbacks, but I noticed that they just fade away really fast, they're less intense, and I feel like the meds just numb me."
7917,I stopped going to therapy once I started my meds because it honestly became pointless.
7918,"I think a lot of this is withdrawal symptoms (even though its been a couple weeks), but the thing is, I really don't want to start meds again and feel like I've failed myself."
7919,Please don't ask me to get back on my meds because I'm just not going to.
7920,Her medications control the outbursts and anger but not the spending.
7921,I made it to my goal dose of medication and it's working well.
7922,"Those of you that feel you're on a good mix of meds, do you still have depressive, hypomanic, and/or mixed episodes?"
7923,"If so, I have a few questions about your experiences:

How do they compare to episodes you had when off meds (or were on the wrong meds)?"
7924,I've been trying to find the right sort of medication and dosage since I was diagnosed type 2 at the start of the year.
7925,"Hey everybody,

I was recently (within the past 6 months) diagnosed with bipolar and put on Lamictal and have been tapering up with the medicine since (am now on 150mg)."
7926,"I didn't feel anything at first, so my doctor and I discussed adding another medication on and said that Abilify would be her first choice."
7927,"Before I was diagnosed, I had a dear friend who was taking a rather large amount of medication in order to treat his bipolar II."
7928,"With all the misery it caused his body to miss one dose, I questioned whether having medications is actually worth it."
7929,"Then, after I was diagnosed, I immediately opted to begin taking medication in attempt to stabilize my own bipolar II without considering how dependent I could become on them."
7930,I told myself that my friend was a special case; I wouldn't become addicted to my medication and I'm not taking nearly as much as he was.
7931,"So, here I am, hopelessly chained to my medication like he was."
7932,Taking medication is a sacrifice for those with mental illness.
7933,"Saying it like that, it honestly doesn't seem like a terrible trade- but strangely I've found that I ""miss myself"" and feel slave to my condition now more than I was without the medication."
7934,"I've tried therapy and medication, and it seemed to make things worse."
7935,Taking all meds.
7936,I was on meds when this all started which makes it even more scary.
7937,"Also, I'm currently not on any medication."
7938,I'm still working with my psych to figure out meds that work.
7939,I have had issues with my medications and feel they need a lot of work.
7940,TLDR i have issues with medication.
7941,I'm not on any meds.
7942,"I do like my meds, and they keep me from mania (not something I enjoy, but I recognize that I shouldn't be manic, leads to bad things and all that) but does anyone find their lows are lower due to their medication (mine being from weight-gain, though there probably can be other reasons."
7943,I know sometimes I feel lower because I feel freakish for needing to be on meds in the first place).
7944,"But, always, there
were those new corners and - when feeling my
normal self, beholden for that self to medicine
and love - I cannot imagine becoming jaded to
life, because I know of those limitless corners,
with their limitless views."
7945,"I'm on meds, seeing my therapist and all that good stuff--but it's still hard every day."
7946,Is it any wonder that bipolar people are so susceptible to self medication and addictive behavior?
7947,As a woman living with bipolar disorder there are a few side effects to my medication I am not too thrilled about.
7948,For three years I was off meds.
7949,Then for two years we were trying to find the right meds.
7950,For about a month now I've been on medications that seem to work.
7951,Does anyone else taking lamictal notice fewer or no orgasms during sex since taking the medicine?
7952,For the past couple of months I was under the impression that I would be able to phase off of my medication.
7953,I knew this wouldn't be quick and I expected to wait a year or so before gradually weening off of the meds.
7954,"IE, I'll be on my meds indefinitely."
7955,Does the fog lift after a prolonged period of medication?
7956,She started seeing a psychologist last couple months and started on new antidepressant medicine gaining in dose as time has gone but she lost her job in February and been stressed on job searching with no prospects in sight.
7957,Finally spoke with her doc who recommended higher dosage antidepressant meds to see if helps lessen the dark thoughts but I feel she may want to speak with someone (like a therapist or another doc to see on meds) to help her through the change and job search.
7958,"And if so, what medication is it?"
7959,I have been off meds for quite some time and not seen my therapist for several months now.
7960,"I feel better when I'm around my doc but I have a hard time following our agreed schedules, meds and plans when I'm managing things on my own."
7961,Well for at least 2 months I have been in a bad place - no meds - my insurance changed and none of my doctors where willing to see me until a new evaluation - why when you change insurance they need to reveal is beyond me - and the reveal is a wait of 4 to 6 months!!
7962,"So here I am = no meds - was on Tegretol and Mirtazapine - haven't had either in months - I have been self medicating myself - like I did in the past to get threw the day - with VOCKA - and no one in my family knows - they cant tell because it makes me ""normal"" - sleeping a lot - went to the hospital and was told unless I am suicidal or willing to get put in the syc tank - I am out of luck
Tough times - 3 years since my dad died - feel like a failure in life - hate my job and myself-
Thinking back - everyone thinks I am a great person - wears my heart on my sleeve 
But I feel like a mess - a failure - was once a really confident and go getter - now just second guess and bow to everyone - 
helps to vent - cant tell my family - I am the rock - but if they only knew-
I am the ""guy"" - my family wants for nothing - I take care of everything - wife doesn't work - all responsibility is on me - I get it done = but feel like I have failed in life - 
Thanks for listing"
7963,"I just started Lamictal, only at 50mg a day, and while I had issues with hypersexuality before I started the meds, now that I'm on it, it's just getting worse."
7964,It's a book about the history of psychiatric medication in the United States and the rise of mental illness.
7965,He also found that children who were placed on these medications at a young age and were on them for long periods of time went on to develop Bipolar Disorder and even Schizophrenia.
7966,I'm not telling anyone they should go off of their medication or not get on one.
7967,I just hope that maybe some day they can figure it out and create safe medications that can cure it and make it manageable without causing other problems or worsening pre-existing ones.
7968,"Btw, here's an example of a peer reviewed article talking about the chemical imbalance myth:

http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020392#pmed-0020392-g001"
7969,His mother believes he hasn't been taking his meds.
7970,They asked him to take his meds in front of them and he threw the bottle on the floor and then took 7 at once.
7971,Does this warrant a trip to the hospital or if he actually starts taking his meds his mood will stabilize on its own?
7972,"Hello, I am about to try to get on Bi-polar meds again, the thing that freaks me out is that I work as an artist and even when I take Zoloft in low doses I develop a tremor that makes it hard to work."
7973,I understand that Bi-polar meds can have the same side effect.
7974,I was just diagnosed with Bipolar II Disorder by my doctor and am waiting to see a psychiatrist before starting medication.
7975,"Between the meds and the pain that made exercise impossible, I gained a lot of weight."
7976,I'm now terrified that I will be put on a medication that makes me gain even more weight.
7977,Does anyone have advice to keep losing after I start a bipolar medication?
7978,Are there meds that don't cause weight gain?
7979,Her doctor wants to try to stabilize her and get her on medication and get her in with a better counselor.
7980,"My meds stabilize me most of the time, but sometimes I just explode and it's so embarrassing."
7981,"I'll get tested shortly for it, and am working with a therapist to tackle the tendencies without medicine as well."
7982,But thia was happening before the medicine.
7983,"4.going to a therapist once a week and medication management once a month is essential for my survival
5. hot bath with bubbles or essential oil"
7984,"After stopping the medication and treating the rash with benadryl, the symptoms began to disappear."
7985,Were you able to find a different medication to improve your depression?
7986,I think I need to start taking my meds again.
7987,What medication has worked best for you and why?
7988,But I'm not on my meds because they're not working and just make me worse.
7989,"Now before you ask, I have an appointment with my pdoc, but the first available time is two months from now, that means two months without working meds."
7990,"And benefits I might have realized while practicing, disappeared 

Is there a reason for a bipolar person to make that kind of investment in meditation and the path when all of your efforts will burn to the ground every time your meds stop working or get switched or you stop taking them altogether."
7991,"**

I was sidelined for a year and gained 80+ pounds due to the meds."
7992,Anyone else get acne from their meds?
7993,And recently after having brain zaps for 4 years (despite not taking meds that can cause it) I always thought there was something not right.
7994,I was promptly put on thyroid medication to help with my tiredness and on the side I took my non-prescribed Adderall.
7995,I realize now that I should not have taken medications not prescribed or overseen by a medical professional.
7996,I feel completely tranquilized emotionally and it's like some new kind of sadistic twist since this has been the first time in my life I've been on this medication and it was hyped up a fair amount.
7997,"Also, good alternatives to lithium (i'd need the medicines active component as I live in sweden and the names are a bit different here)."
7998,Have a long history of awful experiences with meds.
7999,So i took myself off the meds.
8000,Last July I decided to go back on meds because the constant mood swings were becoming difficult to handle.
8001,"My new meds took away the mania, but I was constantly depressed and as time went on it just got worse."
8002,I went into crisis and all my psychiatrists office did was refill my meds and say they'd pass on my current state to my doctor.
8003,My meds were adjusted a little better.
8004,At the same time my PCP took me off of thyroid medicine that I needed in order to feel better physically.
8005,I have been weaning myself off my meds.
8006,At least off meds I was functional.
8007,This past year on meds I've been so consistently depressed I've been completely useless.
8008,Have never had good experiences with them or meds.
8009,My meds were recently changed but I'm finding myself becoming manic (since this past friday) I see my pdoc tomorrow.
8010,"First of all, how do you deal with medications and how would those medications affect the baby?"
8011,I was diagnosed with Bipolar II about a year ago after a year or so of trying different meds for anxiety and depression and a short stay in a psych ward for suicidal ideation.
8012,"After a year of trial and error, I seem to be on the right combination of meds, but I'm still having some notable short-term memory problems (for example: I can't remember names for shit, which is embarrassing), which I think my doctor said might be linked to Lamictal, but also could be because of depression."
8013,"I'm not depressed anymore but I'm having trouble figuring out what the cause might be, and if it is the meds I'm not sure if I'd want to go off of it just when I got everything to work."
8014,"When I was on my medication, it was a lot easier to wake up."
8015,After that it was pain with no meds until I started screaming after 7am.
8016,TLDR; Docs didn't give me pain meds until I was screaming because I told them I take lamotrigine for BP2 - aka I'm another bipolar drug addict looking for a fix ... ah yeah!
8017,"I've been seeing my GP and psychiatrist regularly, and have kept trying new meds to try and control my mood."
8018,"I'm seeing my GP in a week, and I want to ask him about changing my meds, but I'm becoming pretty exhausted with the whole process."
8019,"I hate being depressed, I hate medication."
8020,"I heard meds, lifestyle, and talk therapy are good."
8021,"I have twice, about three years apart before I was diagnosed and put on medication."
8022,"I am on a very tried and true medication regimen that goes a long way to making it easier for to manage my cycles, but I am looking for some kind of supplementary diet to make it even easier."
8023,"Tell us what are they, how did you realize they were delusions, how did they affect your life, and how did your meds affect them?"
8024,"After that I had a long period of very unstable care, literally no continuity even though I was put on medication (which led to a few points where I was just left without a prescription for a few weeks, and one where it was taken away due to being contraindicated - I was on Depakote, and I'm a ciswoman of childbearing age)."
8025,When I finally got a regular psychiatrist/care co-ordinator he expressed that he wanted me to get to the point where I was 'recovered' enough to not take meds.
8026,"I know I bring some issues to the table, I am very self critical, and easily depressed (and have recently started medication for anxiety/depression) and all these issues bother me a lot, since I enjoy physical intimacy very much, and the fact that he can't even kiss me is hugely distressing, but I have largely given up trying to get him to do anything physical at all."
8027,"He's very good at managing his bipolar, to the point where I forget that he has it (he is also not currently on any medication, his doctors know this), but it dawned on me today that this whole messy situation, which is basically him having a hard time committing, may be accounted to, at least in part, to his bipolar."
8028,I am in adjustment period of meds trying to come out of a deep depression!
8029,"It's now been a week and a half since starting these new meds, and she's getting to the point where she can't go out in public, or interact with her family without going on rants and becoming aggressive ."
8030,"Is this normal to have this adjustment period, or are these bad reactions to these meds?"
8031,"TLDR: I was accused of a crime, protected my friend by pleading the 5th, was charged, jailed, not given medication, bonded out, saw my lawyer, saw my P-doc, and I'm aye-okay now."
8032,"So to start off, let me say that it has been quite a while since I've even taken my meds... Two years ago, my mother died, and I chose to deal with her death naturally, rather than drug myself up and feel nothing..."
8033,"You see, I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2, Depression, Anxiety, and OCD about 5 years ago, and spent the first three on 2 different medications."
8034,"He has added two new medications to the mix, and I'm very nervous about it because...

* I've never heard of these two medications (Abilify &amp; Vyvanse)."
8035,"* I don't know how these will interact together, along with my other meds."
8036,"Here are the names, dosages, and uses of the medications I have been assigned...

* **Sertraline 50mg ; Take one capsule every morning."
8037,"My main questions are...

* Has anyone ever used some, or all, of these medications in combination?"
8038,* Did you have any problems with the medication?
8039,"TL;DR - Was prescribed two new medications by new psychiatrist (Abilify &amp; Vyvanse), on top of existing prescription (Sertraline &amp; Trazodone)."
8040,"Nervous about interactions/interferences, as well as side effects, and effectiveness of medication + combination."
8041,"I'm being patient and from what I've read and discussed I understand that it's most likely medications it's just that when I bring it up I.E. """
8042,"She won't take medicine like previously and now thinks that the disorder is just POOF, gone."
8043,"I'm currently taking Lithium and Gabapentin, but I can't tell if things start to get better because of my medication, or because it's situational until I stop taking them because I get manic."
8044,He has straight up asked me what meds I wanted to take.
8045,"One, I do not want to be on medication."
8046,"So I'm without medication (save the worthless Welbutrin that I was only taking to ""wake me up"" from the Seroquel) and it's really starting to get to me."
8047,"I suffer from migraines, so he's also trained to bring me my medication and a bottled water."
8048,I cant afford therapy/can never commit and I feel like my medication isn't working.
8049,i'm bipolar and for a while was loaded on a lot of meds that started to interfere with my life with their side effects.
8050,"i was so glad about my progress with the withdrawls i tried to get off my antipsychotic, which is next on the list to get off anyways (im not getting off my lithium or my seizure meds though) but i got no sleep and really couldn't function at all today."
8051,"She's having me stay on the meds I'm already on for now, but it was just such a frustrating appointment... How have any of you guys dealt with a new doc questioning your diagnosis after only one visit?"
8052,"She fucked up her meds and didn't even tell him and he's sitting here being guilty about ruining her life telling me how ""if he knew about it he would have resolved the breakup sooner."""
8053,"* Current dosage is 100mg (last three and a half weeks), about to go to 150mg
* Started noticing positive (best medication tried type) results at five and a half weeks taking it."
8054,I'm consistent with taking my everyday meds.
8055,I know its personal preference but how flexible are you when it comes to switching meds to save money?
8056,"On 1 potential plan, one of my current meds would cost me $300/month."
8057,I discovered that it should be taken on an empty stomach(2hr before or after eating) and my other medications tell me to eat with them with food so I've been delaying taken the synthroid so that my body could absorb it better.
8058,Was it me missing the meds that caused the flare ups?
8059,I stopped taking meds for it when I was 19.
8060,"I'm afraid to seek help or take meds, but do you think it's a good idea?"
8061,"I was just wondering if there are any other resources on the internet where I can discuss my meds, mood swings and all things disease related."
8062,"I was diagnosed and put on a medication, but it seems to be losing its effectiveness."
8063,Is there anything I can do to alleviate the symptoms while I try different medications?
8064,Here's my dilemma: I'm low on certain medications (a few of which I need a written prescription for) and my psychiatrist is gone for the next week.
8065,How do I get medication in a different state?
8066,"Since I started medication (about a month ago), things have become a little clearer and I've stopped bouncing from idea to idea, but I still lack a consciousness of time."
8067,"I am on Saphris and Lamictal, do either of these medications have this affect?"
8068,"I am also a recovering alcoholic &amp; am known to enjoy any medication which gives me a warm &amp; fuzzy feeling inside, so needless to say I have to be extremely cautious."
8069,I use nicotine patches for adhd since stimulant meds make me a monster (apparently) and I am wondering what interaction nicotine might have with abilify.
8070,"Now, three months later, I'm taking meds, FINALLY successfully holding down an internship (!!!"
8071,Nobody would tell me why my medication was being fucked with.
8072,"Or I change things and have no one to watch over me if I
react badly to new meds."
8073,"And of course the answer is that getting the right meds will fix
issues like what I'm dealing with."
8074,"I can't tell everybody about my bipolar diagnosis but it's hard to hide the medication and side effects, especially if you live with them (hint: Asian parents)."
8075,"I will definitely keep pushing for help, but as I'm so desperate to avoid a full cycling of hypomania and the inevitable depression afterwards, I can't help but be drawn to self medication of some kind should it get to that point...."
8076,Even though I've been having some difficulty with the medication I feel like I've improved immensely from just understanding whats coming from what and knowing now that I just need to *force* myself to be what I want.
8077,The other meds stayed the same.
8078,"My boyfriend of three years recognizes changes in my behavior but assumes I am not taking my meds, or my sleep schedule is off by my choice (it's not by choice) and that's the issue."
8079,What do you other rapid cyclers or ultradian bipolar sufferers talk about when your meds poop out on you or aren't helping you?
8080,on top of that i had to leave my pdoc and went without my meds for some time.
8081,i've just found another doctor that i think i like and have just started back on my meds but i'm not even up to the full dose yet.
8082,I stopped taking my medication about a year ago mainly because it I no longer have health insurance and it stopped working anyway.
8083,"Now I don't know if its the disease that is causing my cognitive ability to degenerate, or if it was the prolonged exposure to the medications that I was on."
8084,"I do understand that everyone has different reactions to different medicines, but I don't want to worry myself into a frenzy.)"
8085,I still have 10 days before I can get on meds (for the first time ever.
8086,The medication seems to be working sometimes.
8087,There's so many things I planned to do when the medication were to start working.
8088,UPDATE: slight meds adjustment as well as a commitment to work on some of this stuff in couples/premarital counseling by both of us.
8089,"Thankfully, the meds are making these episodes much shorter, but fuck the brain fog."
8090,"And she doesn't do counseling, just meds and stuff."
8091,"I've been on 300mg XL for about 2 weeks now and feel even more sleepy and unmotivated than usual...my doctor said it was supposed to do the opposite, but I know meds effect everyone differently."
8092,"And yet I'm on no medication (except smoking a bit), I'm up and down, but not way up or way down, just dabbling between them daily."
8093,"If I go on meds, I become more stable, but lose a piece of what makes me, me."
8094,"Go on meds, become a zombie, but ""better""."
8095,"Go to GP, new meds (Sertaline), 2 weeks of work to adjust."
8096,They change my meds.
8097,"I research myself, I am getting fed up, 6 Years, No Diagnosis and could potentially be on the wrong meds for 3 - 4 Years."
8098,"I swore at my teachers, I stole stuff from school, I used to skip school regular.... Just impulsive reckless decisions

I really need a diagnosis so that i can get the right meds...."
8099,I also fairly certain that regular therapy and meds need to be a part of my life.
8100,Reading posts about people being hypomanic or manic or depressed got me wondering to what extent everyone's meds are working to keep them stable.
8101,"Do you still get cycles of (hypo)mania and depression despite being on meds and if so, are you trying to find a better dosage or med cocktail?"
8102,I'm fairly well medicated myself but still get bouts of depression and wonder at what point one has to just accept that medicine can't cure everything.
8103,But when i came home i saw what meds he prescribed and they are: Carbamazepin and Paroxetin.
8104,"""has your gp put you on medication?"""
8105,"A fact that may or may not be helpful is that he's not medicated (for reasons involving past experiences and reactions to medications), but he's fully aware of the disorder and how it affects his mood."
8106,Should I consider meds?
8107,"Hey :)

I'm not too sure where to begin, I stopped taking my meds (Lithium, 250mg) about 4 weeks ago and have just started taking seroquel (25mg) for the past 5 nights just before bedtime."
8108,"I'll be telling you about my experience with bipolar disorder and my views on it, along with my views on medication, and then asking for you points of view."
8109,He took a lot of meds that onle made his condition worse (i refuse to go down that road myself).
8110,"So now i ask you reddit: What do you guys think about the prophecy stuff, my views on medication, and the general view of the bipolar situation?"
8111,"My medication is Seroquel 100 mg and Seroquel XR 200 mg.

Do you have any experiences with bipolar disorder, Seroquel and LSD/MDMA?"
8112,I've never had nightmares on meds before so I'm not sure if the dose is too high.
8113,"I'd always be told to compare how I was pre-meds to how I am now, and I can see the difference, but I realised today.."
8114,"Anyway, we decided screw it, to not change my meds."
8115,What will it feel like when my medication is working?
8116,I sit up and open the computer and immediately watch an entire season of a tv show I've seen before like a zombie--even forgetting to take my meds.
8117,"When I was manic, I was getting very paranoid but I was also drinking a lot and really inconsistent with taking medication."
8118,3 more days in hospital due to an allergic reaction to the medication.
8119,"I've never really had proper treatment, or been on medication for an extended period."
8120,I am off a lot of the meds I was on and I have made a complete u turn.
8121,My seizure medication is now two instead of one.
8122,"The doctor today, who I sought out based on experience working with women on medication, basically started telling me how damaging the meds could be while giving statistics that are wildly different than anything I've read or my psychiatrist has given me ( the OB said  10-15% chance of side effects from lithium and that lithium and lamictol are some of the worst choices)."
8123,The stats I've come across are much lower and the literature states my medications as some of the better ones.
8124,My psych had hesitantly said she would help wean me off meds if I felt strongly about it.
8125,I scheduled an appointment with my doctor to evaluate my medication.
8126,Finally with a combination of the right meds and therapy I stabilized and was able to start working at as a one-on-one instructor at a school for children with Autism.
8127,I took one medication and had never been in any serious trouble.
8128,Taking four different meds that keep me from losing my mind or becoming actively suicidal.
8129,"We've been friends since high school, I don't know if it's the medication or just the disorder that has changed the personality."
8130,Sometimes she'll just stand and stare at nothing and takes forever to answer a question (I think it's because she is afraid of getting judged bc of what she says and probably the meds).
8131,been on meds since.
8132,"So, I really don't want to take another medication on top of what i'm already taking right now."
8133,I knew something wasnt right so I went to a doctor and started medication.This was the most terrifying experience I've ever encountered but I still managed to graduate from college with a degree in engineering in 2009.
8134,"I'm 27, not on medication, male and have been single since the beginning of 02/15."
8135,"I know there are plenty of people with bipolar who don't take meds and can function without them, right?"
8136,"Could be my meds, could just be me, I don't fucking know."
8137,Is this a normal reaction to starting up on timereleased meds?
8138,"three years on different meds,
one year without any friends,
two years with one friend,
weeks at home playing video games,
days close to drop out,
years of social phobia,
two years close to collapse,
months of anxiety,
years of fucking up,
times of fun,
moments of happiness,
I got through it"
8139,"I felt this before starting it, but I was hoping the medication would solve this issue."
8140,I will share some articles of how I'm managing my BP I with minimun medication.
8141,medications.
8142,Now I know that since the manic episode she stopped taking her meds because she decided they weren't working.
8143,"When he was diagnosed, his psychiatrist immediately stopped that medication and started him on a mood stabilizer (lamictal)."
8144,For the record I DO NOT EVER CALL MY PSYCH because I dont like changing meds.
8145,Is there anyone else with Bipolar 2 rapid cycling NOT taking any meds where things are going well?
8146,I've had a horrible experience the last 2 years taking medication trying new medication mixed phases induced by medication and have STOPPED taking medication once again.
8147,Every doctor I talk to insists that I have to take medication to have a chance at living with the illness... but up until 2 years ago I lived with it WITHOUT medication.
8148,I didn't know who I was when I was taking the medication and felt like a emotionless thing just floating though life.
8149,She is pregnant and therefore off her meds.
8150,Do you have any advice on how to help her manage her illness while she's off her meds?
8151,"(this is all pre-medication)

The passions dwindled after a few months of obsession and too much money spent."
8152,"I'm noticing random spurts of feelings, to varying intensities... but in general I'm just still really off and I feel like it could be the medication still affecting me but I'm not sure."
8153,And I haven't felt like myself at all since I started the meds.
8154,I am not on medication since I don't do well on them.
8155,"I came closest to ending it when I was on medication, and its not a place I really wanna go back to."
8156,"When this started, my doctor changed the Lamictal to 2x a day and changed the dose, he said if it didn't help, I've had no luck with other meds, my only options are to try Lithium or another anti-psychotic."
8157,After the weight gain (and recent loss of 70lbs) I have other health issues that I'm concerned about and afraid changing meds will exacerbate them.
8158,"(Just as an aside, he has seen me since changing the meds, but it's during relatively stable times and I feel fine) 

I started therapy and really like the therapist, I've only gone three times, but we are making progress to where I am at least cognizant that there is a problem and can recognize some of the early signs."
8159,My main question is if anyone has had noticeable improvement or if I should go see about trying different medication.
8160,I AM still on my medication.
8161,My boyfriend is stopping medication today.
8162,"No meds, no insurance, long story, but really no options med or therapy wise."
8163,Or have you had any unexpected rashes while taking the medication?
8164,"See the thing is, is that I know my body and once every 3-6 months my meds quite on me and I don't know why might be biology."
8165,I'm VERY sensitive to meds as is I'm on Lamotrigine its been raised from 150 to 200mgs.
8166,My main question is does anyone else have the problems with the meds?
8167,"Hey everyone,
I'm a freshman college student (USA), and lately I've had some bad bouts of depression even though my meds would typically handle it."
8168,"I don't seem to go abnormally manic, so I'm not convinced that it's my meds that are affecting me."
8169,"I stopped the medications, thinking the doctors were wrong since the meds didn't help."
8170,I was prescribed medication after medication.
8171,I'm really worried shes going to think i'm taking a small dose of lithium and be stricter on my meds or take them away my ambien or ritalin because she thinks i'm irresponsible with my meds.
8172,"I'm currently on medication (200 lambipol, 10 sycrest (asenapine), 150-300 seroquel)."
8173,"There are a lot of reasons I don't want kids, but possibly having to go off my meds, post-partum depression, etc., factor highly for me."
8174,"and if there is humility in that approach and I’m using medications, what is there to fear?"
8175,I'm getting pretty good at controlling things without meds or therapy (10+ years now)...
8176,It's been 48 hours without my meds about.
8177,And I forgot to take my meds when I should have this morning.
8178,"PS&gt; Im diagnosed as BP2, medicated and strictly following my medication, and I am and will (definitely, no bs) start CBT ASAP."
8179,Someone please tell me that this anxiety is from the medication and that it'll get better and there is a chance that I will be okay.
8180,Our insurance only covers 50% of most mental health meds - so we are looking at between $350-400 monthly.
8181,If I stop taking the meds I feel agitated at literally anything my S/O says.
8182,"Some advice, please: A dear friend of mine is going through her first manic episode (unknown if it's bipolar or just medication-related break) and has been hospitalized."
8183,"She's been admitted to psych hospitals over 30 times, has been on so many different meds over the years."
8184,He had been falsely diagnosed as depressive beforehand and had attempted suicide as a result of the incorrect medication.
8185,"Now, he's been getting (unfortunately very little) therapy and psychological evaluations while imprisoned, even been deliberately taken off his bipolar meds at times."
8186,Im angry that hes gone 8 years without medication management or theraputic services even though he knew he'd been cycling.
8187,"So, I was thinking maybe we could have a FAQ section that's highly visable about symtoms, treatments, medications and a strong recommendation to get help, maybe even a link to a clinic finder."
8188,Lately I've been really worrying about medication.
8189,That too worked for a little bit but exacerbated symptoms as well as horrible side effects and I took myself off of the meds in March.
8190,"To be honest, the best was when I was off of all meds, aside from the psychosis."
8191,"All the medication that I have been on the past 4 years has either not worked, worked for a little, or work but have such bad side effects it makes me stop taking them."
8192,I'm on medication and going to see my doctor on Thurs to get them changed (I've literally slept for more than 17 hours).
8193,I talked to my GP and got an appointment with my psychiatrist for a review of my medication.
8194,"I've been without medication(due to moving, so not my fault) for almost 3 months now and I thought I was doing good."
8195,Or are these just commonly prescribed medications?
8196,"I can't get into see my psych for a few weeks still, and I'm sure he would be more than happy for me to lower the dose (I'm sensible with my meds, never miss them etc."
8197,Be careful with meds from now on.
8198,"I'm mixed, I think I had forgotten to take my medication this morning so I jumped on that."
8199,"I have been medically compliant, reaching out to friends and mostly abstaining from the activities that I was told would interfere with my meds."
8200,I dont like medicine when I am manic because I feel like I am being robbed of my gift (I see bipolar as a gift more than a curse because of art) and at depression times all I want is to be doped up..
8201,oh shit i forgot to take my meds.....
8202,"I'm currently on medication, and have been for a few years, but I still have my good/bad days... are there any tips anyone could give me for dealing with people when I can't get away?"
8203,I told her I've built my life on fighting this disorder in every day and in every way (meds and years of intensive therapy.)
8204,I have been diagnosed and on a variety of meds.
8205,I'm on medication to help me not become manic.
8206,I'm trying to find ways to cope with my bipolar until I can get an appointment to get real medication.
8207,"She was nice, it was fine, but right away I knew she wouldn't be able to prescribe medication or make the official diagnosis."
8208,"I don’t think I expected to boom get medication today, but I had hoped to get some sort of direction."
8209,"I think that’s fantastic and I’m doing it, but I feel impatient to get on medication."
8210,It will still be a process to find a new doctor and restart meds but I am not sure I will get to the end result without making a few rash decisions before that.
8211,"I really think it can help with my anxiety and control issues, but I also wonder if I would get into this kind of relationship if I was on meds and in therapy."
8212,"So, I was told to discontinue the meds - Christmas day I finally felt whatever normal is for me."
8213,"I hate the thought of being on meds the rest of my life, but I suppose it's better than checking out early..."
8214,"I went through the usual denial of diagnosis based on my response to certain meds, lack of depressive feelings, and having a normal sleep cycle."
8215,"""I'm pretty normal right now, I don't need to worry about triggering anything with these ADD meds!"
8216,You also have no clue how hard it is to function with something like this without medication.
8217,Now I know it is the oldest and really the most successful medication for bipolar disorder however I'm not so sure if it helps and if I even like being on it.
8218,I'm being kicked out of my house unless I go back on my meds but I don't want to live my life being bipolar and having to take meds and see that stupid fucking look on peoples faces when I tell them what I am.
8219,"I keep wanting to go off the meds to stop limiting my range of emotion, and I'm resisting the urge to go back to old habits like using coke to get up."
8220,What are your experiences with going off meds or using substances to influence mood shifts?
8221,"So many things in my past make much more sense, and hopefully my new meds, once titrated properly will help..."
8222,When did I last take my meds again?
8223,But is it the meds or am I just a whiny little bitch?
8224,"Well the year in between had been stressfull due to not being on medication, and it didnt really get any better or worse."
8225,I have both but since adding Seroquel I feel like my ADHD medicine isn't working as well.
8226,"**Tl;dr medication stopped working, bouts of overwhelming suicidal urges."
8227,My recent PMHNP just prescribed me Trazodone on top of my daily medication of Geodon (Ziprasidone) and Buspar (Buspirone).
8228,"For example, I am undergoing ECT and taking a TON of medicines."
8229,I have been fine for a long time and have not taken medicine (lithium) for about 6 months now.
8230,Is it my meds?
8231,This week I hit some fininacial hardship and was choosing between buying medication or doctor visits.
8232,"So when my parents gave me a loan for both today, I called CVS to find out how much it is to transfer the medication I was told $112 for 30 pills!"
8233,I'm lonely as hell because I don't know anyone here and despite still taking my meds I am starting to crash into a depressive state.
8234,"Last night however, even after taking the medication which knocks me the heck out, I was drawing up plans, searching online for gear to use and doing research on how to murder this guy I used to know."
8235,I'm just wondering how these two types of medication compliment one another and what effects each is supposed to produce.
8236,"So I had an appointment with my psychiatrist today, and I told him this: ""I'm concerned about the long-term side effects of the medications I'm on and after talking with my family and my wife I'd like to be weened off my medications."
8237,"I was expecting pushback, but instead he just helped me come up with a plan to slowly reduce dosages of each of my medications in turn over the next several months."
8238,"I was finally put on the right medication (Lithium, Lamictal and Invega) and ended up passing all my classes."
8239,We're slowly changing my medicine to reduce side affects.
8240,"That said, I'm on meds to prevent my fathers side from bleeding through, or at least to minimize such."
8241,"I prefer being the real me (read: ""me"" on meds + alcohol = counterracted meds = real me)."
8242,I say apparently because even last night after being back on his meds for 7 days he think this has all been blown out of proportion by his family.
8243,"I don't particularly enjoy taking medication, and my psychiatrist knows this."
8244,"She would remind me every week to take my medication, but I'd just consciously ignore her advice."
8245,"This may seem ignorant or irresponsible, but I'm just really not too fond of medication."
8246,"I just visited her today, and she's forcing me to go back on medication."
8247,"I asked her why she didn't force me a few months ago, and she said that taking medication needs to make sense to me, and be meaningful to me."
8248,"And if that meant struggling for a few months to realize that I truly do need medication, well, she let me struggle and just watched me to make sure I didn't land myself in the hospital."
8249,I was recently off meds for 6 months for the first time in my adult life and it was too much for me.
8250,"I am lucky to have the introspection and support system to have realized it an gotten back on meds, I guess."
8251,"Is there a medication for bipolar depression that doesn't weight gain, libido loss, and does NOT conflict with hormonal birth control pills?"
8252,"I feel awful because not only do I take these medications 2-3x daily, but I cant cry or have the anxiety reaction from my body."
8253,I went on meds and it helped to take away my manic thoughts.
8254,"She's on meds, getting treatment, trying to reduce stress, get regular sleep, eat okay, blahblahblah."
8255,I'm bipolar 1...&amp; on meds.
8256,"He brought along a whole bagful of books and spent the better part of two hours outlining this theory that chemical imbalances don't exist, bipolar and other diagnoses are skyrocketing because psychiatric medications are causing the conditions they're meant to solve, psychiatry is dominated by Big Pharma and is just a bunch of crooks, etc...he's convinced that if I continue to see a psychiatrist and take meds, I'm going to end up manic and psychotic (I'm BP II and have only ever experienced hypomania)."
8257,So what I'd like to hear from you all is your personal experiences with psychiatrists and medication.
8258,I don't have much personal experience because I'm recently diagnosed and have only just started the process of finding meds that work.
8259,"*Month 1:* Hard to fully accept the diagnosis, felt like it fits but could not internalise the consequences of meds, and letting loved ones know about the condition openly."
8260,"Ran out of meds and couldn't sleep, full blown dark period, the worse 24 hours."
8261,"We did communicate some via text message, and she's given me instructions to increase my meds as well as giving me priority if someone cancels before my scheduled appointment."
8262,"First I saw a psychologist, then a psychiatrist - both said I'm bipolar depressive more-so, but the psychiatrist (or whoever prescribes meds) took a much more thorough approach the secondary time around and diagnosed me as Bipolar type 1."
8263,And he even went as far as to prescribe me medication.
8264,"On top of all of this, I haven't had to pay (and no I'm not insured) for anything other than the meds."
8265,"I constantly go off my meds, and I blame it on forgetfulness, but I don't know if that's even really what it is."
8266,My pdoc got me on the right medication and my therapist has help me combat things day-to-day.
8267,I've started on new medication and I really hope it works.
8268,"My moods have drastically changed in the past month and I feel like my meds are not working anymore, slowly."
8269,"And I'm very wary of psychiatric medication, since it is such a hit-or-miss-in-the-dark kind of thing."
8270,"I present to you... *tiny drum roll please halt*

(Somewhat) **[organised meds!"
8271,"My meds were jut scattered across desks, and I usually had to hunt to find the unopened ones."
8272,"Next up - labels reminding me to get my repeat prescriptions (I forget every time - oh you need three workings days to get your extremely important psychiatric medication, but your severe psychiatric condition can make mindless repetitive tasks very hard (like getting a repeat prescription = YAWN) good planning guys!)"
8273,"He's on lithium, lamotrigine, abilify, gabapentin, and thyroid meds."
8274,"He's tried so many medications and nothing seems to work, and it's discouraging and frightening."
8275,"In my early twenties between medications things would get really bad, but it's kind of hard for me to remember specific incidents as I tend to disassociate."
8276,Eventually I took a Xanax with my night meds and although it's the same dose I always take it calmed me down so much that my words were slurring and I couldn't move.
8277,I'm planning to talk to my psychiatrist but I'd just really like to know if someone else has had similar experiences when starting new meds.
8278,"I started meds about 10 years ago and found stuff that worked a little bit after 5 years, then changed those and added more.. you know the drill."
8279,So basically I've been off meds since mid-december.
8280,Now usually getting off my meds would set me off and I'd get super depressed or manic but so far nothing like that has happened.
8281,"Seems to me like telling a doctor ""Yeah I feel fine you know, but I should probably take those meds anyway"" isn't really gonna go too well?"
8282,"I take medication but I still smoke a fuck ton of marijuana daily to numb myself, nobody understands me, so there is no point in talking to anyone to make myself feel better, and they will just judge me."
8283,"I mix other things with my meds too besides weed, I LOVE kratom, caffeine, energy drinks, and I take adderall for school too."
8284,So I've been depressed for months lately especially since I started meds.
8285,"I feel sad that it took three medications to make me functional and that they made me gain a lot of weight, but I'm moving in the right direction."
8286,"I love the apartment I live in and my roommate couldn't be more awesome, and my medication works."
8287,"Fast forward through a number of up and down cycles I didn't really understand anything about (given that I hadn't received proper knowledge of what was happening to me mentally and the consistent changes to medications) my wife and I had left for the city for potential job opportunities; and I had the bright idea to stop the Zoloft cold turkey (Why not since I was getting it through my mother, whom had it prescribed to her for stress and I wasn't going to be getting it from her any longer, right?)."
8288,"Two months in with no medication, no therapy, no job and our savings dwindling I experienced what I believe to be an emotional or mental breakdown."
8289,After a few months at my job I found a counseling center my insurance covers (the one good thing about my damnable job) and have been seeing a therapist once a week and psychiatrist once a month for medication.
8290,"**TL;DR**: Diagnosed with OCD &amp; Bipolar Disorder in teens, was fed drug cocktails until 20's with intermittent therapy, moved to city for potential work, plans didn't work out, had breakdown, got job, got weekly therapy and medication, re-diagnosed with OCD &amp; Cyclothymia, trying to figure out how to deal with the cycles, looking for other people who may have advice."
8291,"I used medication up until three years ago, when I decided to stop because of the way they made me feel."
8292,Is it possible that maybe a medication change could help with the hot flashes?
8293,"As a final good thing, thanks to the pain medication I'm going to be able to start going to the gym with my mom a few days a week and that will do even more for my body and mood."
8294,My medications knock me the hell out.
8295,I also think I am on the wrong medication for my true diagnosis.
8296,And I certainly think going away to an RTC for six months (average) just for medicine change seems a bit drastic.
8297,"My psychiatric nurse practitioner just prescribed me Rispersal, because she didn't think my insurance would cover other meds without me trying this first."
8298,The only other psych meds I'm taking is Depakote.
8299,This is just a note for all yous guys on medication.
8300,"As I'm sure you already know, it is very unwise to drink alcohol while on many medications (antidepressants, anti-anxieties...etc."
8301,"If you are at all unaware just how bad the effects of drinking on your meds can be, and you are or have thought about having an occasional or casual drink, **don't do it**."
8302,"My SO has type II and had a moderate amount of alcohol on New Years, while also on his meds."
8303,"There are a lot of things that he said and did that I don't feel the need to detail here, but I will say that drinking *any* amount of alcohol while on your meds is not worth the risk."
8304,"So after three months of counselor, psychiatrist, and psychologist meetings my parents have been willing to accept that I'm someone that needs medication."
8305,"After missing some of my meds for a week, having a best friend have a new baby when I'm desperate for one and after a recent termination (complicated), helping her move out of a potential dv situation while counselling the partner aswell, another friend shooting up ice, and my mother thousands of km's away while I'm in a tiny island community with only one sane friend /ex bf /carer, and an extremely busy pdoc on the mainland Im not surprisingly not coping."
8306,"When I get a chance I will write more about being bipolar, I am terrified to go on medication, I've only tried lithium."
8307,"Geography, geology, biology, chemistry, sociology, anthropology, physics, medicine, psychology, etc all hold a deep seated interest ... for short periods of time."
8308,Right now I'm off meds.
8309,"I've been as depressed and suicidal on meds as much as I have been off of them, though I did notice a big, but short-lived, boost in mood from my last go around with Effexor (75mg)."
8310,It's great to hear that people are also finding the right medication for themselves (though I'm not saying other meds aren't equally as helpful to other people).
8311,"I'd like to share my story in the hopes that people who are just starting medication can feel comfortable with the decision, as a way to commend those of you who are staying vigilant on your efforts to stability and living a healthy life style, and a little bit of self-affirmation, because we deserve to pat ourselves on the back sometimes."
8312,Throughout my life I've been placed on various medications.
8313,"Some with horrible results (anti-depressants that induced hellacious manic episodes), ineffective treatments that made me averse to the idea of taking medication (atypical anti-psycothics that induced a ridiculous appatite and dulled me too much), and others that had benefits, but weren't entirely effective."
8314,"After years of ups and downs, never feeling comfortable with meds and a general dismay towards the idea of better living through medication, a doctor recommended I give Lamictal a shot."
8315,"My father kept the bottle on the kitchen counter, just as a reminder that they exist, and that he is supportive of me taking meds."
8316,"I begin taking meds for my condition and end my life as a ""natural"" person."""
8317,I didn't want meds and bi-polar disorder to be my reality.
8318,Starting meds is a difficult journey.
8319,I'm having tough week...ran out of three medications and couldn't get them refilled for four days.
8320,"I am on a large regimen of medications, but I also have extreme symptoms and have been disabled by this condition."
8321,Not sure if I'm just maturing or this is due to the meds.
8322,Been hardly able to work- meds make me sleep so much 10-12 hour days are impossible.
8323,I know I have some unresolved issues and what not but its never been this bad until my meds got screwed up.
8324,"Then he found some pills, and the next thing I know, he hates the way his medication makes him feel so he's not taking it anymore and we can't afford for him to keep spending $50/wk on therapy."
8325,Even though there is a possibility that the meds might not work for you the best thing you can do is try.
8326,"I live each day tentatively reaching for the next space in front of me, stretching just a little past what I know as I test a mind that is restless, held at bay by the meager chains of medication and the regimented schedule I adhere to in order to insure stability."
8327,"I've started medication a few weeks ago, finally got a straight diagnosis."
8328,The medications from psychiatrist never work.
8329,"So many sleepless nights that seriously messed up my medication, but I pulled through."
8330,"I knew there would be a lot of all nighters, so I had my doctor we in me off of my meds."
8331,As soon as I was put on meds (for depression) I ballooned up.
8332,I stopped taking my medications and went down to 230 and have maintained that these last few years.
8333,Have any of you had weight complications due to medications?
8334,He said the doctor gave him meds awhile back but he doesn't like how they made him feel so he stopped taking them.
8335,The medication is called Olanzapine.
8336,He is acting strange and he says the medication makes him tired when he takes it.
8337,"He said it was for further assessment there, and perhaps an extended stay to get my medication corrected."
8338,"But now that I've spent several days out of being in the ward, my suicidal ideation is back and I'm hatching ""departure plans"" (for lack of a better term) such as writing notes and selecting the medication to overdose on..."
8339,I don't want to disappoint him in a way cause he's been trying to find the right medication combo for almost 3 years now.
8340,"TL;DR: Spent 2 weeks in psych ward after being sent there for expressing suicidal feelings, got some new meds added, now suicidal again and at a loss of what to do."
8341,"Living on campus because I don't drive)

I don't know if this is a problem with being in a new situation, or if I need to have my meds adjusted."
8342,At least I can try a different medication and hopefully one that will help.
8343,"I talked with a nurse today, told me I could talk to someone tomorrow, most likely sending the meds by that evening."
8344,I want to try a 30 day challenge to helping my sanity and I'm gonna write about it what I do and how it is effecting me while being off medication.
8345,During this time she also ran out of her medication and withdrew into herself.
8346,My therapist thinks I need to see my doctor so I can get back on some kind of medication again.
8347,I've tried so much medicine that I have permanent damage to my body.
8348,My doctor is grasping at straws because I just seem to be getting worse but I've tried every medicine I can.
8349,"I'm going through a rough time again, and so many medicines just aren't working so I have had one session and half a total of 10 scheduled."
8350,"(just now sticking with it) But now reading these posts in combination with new medication, I realize I've had many manic episodes."
8351,"Anyway, we've decided that for now I'm going to remain medicationless aside from a little ativan for when I notice a rather bad manic episode coming on, and treat this with CBT."
8352,Then comes winter break; she's on new meds and our sex life pretty much disappears.
8353,"Follow up to this:
http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1a96fv/update_girlfriend_of_seven_years_is_trying_to/

A brief background: Girlfriend was diagnosed with BPII, tried different meds for a few months that zombified her."
8354,"Basically I'm holding strong, doing well on my meds, all that fun stuff."
8355,I was diagnosed five years ago but I don't take meds except for a period of around six months when I just went absolutely ape-shit and was rapid cycling.

8378,"Before the diagnosis and subsequent medication, my life fell apart: I destroyed my academic standing and left university, lost a job that I loved, and did some serious damage to long-standing relationships."
8379,I still experienced mood swings and hallucinations but I had the added sense of shame when taking my medications.
8380,So I stopped about a month ago.I feel more stable now off my medications than I did on them.
8381,Only my best friend knows I'm off my medications.
8382,I don't mean to say medication is bad or shameful.

I'm just wondering what (if any) tactics have worked for you in coping with the lack of concentration and lethargy brought on by medication side effects?"
8392,I know it's a common side effect of sodium valproate and I know I need to look for a balance in medication but I have only just started seeing my new psychiatrist (only had my first appointment with her so far) so I haven't had a chance to ask her about it.
8393,I can't stand it when people (jokingly) suggest that I adjust my medication.

8401,"I might give it a try, but I'm feeling completely overwhelmed right now despite having been in and out of therapy for almost fifteen years now -- I figure I've been to so many therapists without progress that medication probably has the best chance of working."

8405,I attend therapy regularly and am medication compliant.
8406,You take medication every day.

8410,Edit;  Can't get into my doctor to change my meds soon and I know that the trileptal I'm tapering off of is making it worse.

after looking about it more I found a study that actually used the side-effect and found out that humans have a set [tone perception](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16181754)

I'm still taking the medication because it's helping... and after awhile I got used to it."
8417,"(another long story)

8420,"I was taking 5 mg of Abilify and 160 mg of Lamictal, but I stopped taking my medication because I felt like I could function without it and my boyfriend (who told me he ""doesn't believe in bipolar"" and ""doesn't think I am bipolar"") said I didn't need it and that it made me crazy."
8421,And how do I go back on my medication without my boyfriend knowing-if I even do (he'll freak out about it because he thinks the medication will make me break up with him...)?
8422,"I have to deal with this disease for the rest of my life, no medications make me feel any better, and honestly I'm always operating from a mean less than 0, so if death is at 0, no suffering, just nothing, is there really any reason to stay."
8423,"I've been doing much, much better with my medications lately."
8424,"I got diagnosed 8 months ago and I was doing good, after trying a thousand different types of medication, but now I stopped going to therapy forgetting my meds and today I called a rescheduled my dr. apt knowing I may not have enough meds to make it."

8441,"I have reached a point in my life where I understand that I need to consistently take my medication to keep me sane, grounded, and stable, but while he knows I suffer from mental illness, I don't think he will actually believe it until he sees it at its worst—or at the very least unmedicated."

I know the meds are the way to go, but sometimes it is not enough."
8461,After being here for a while I've seen the panic in people's posts when they accidentally run out of medication.
8462,"Either the pharmacy messes up and doesn't fill it in time, your insurance denies it for some stupid reason, your doctor forgets to fill it, you can't get in to see a doctor, you miscalculate, or a hundred other reasons that end up with you missing doses of your meds."
8463,I find myself hoarding meds that I'm on by filling Rx's of other strengths.

8468,"In between October and a few days after the episode, I had visited my counselor around 4-5 times asking if he was sure that I didn't need medication, solely because I assumed that all people with bipolar were supposed to be on it."
8469,The risks of medication did not outweigh the benefits.
8470,The last time I saw my counselor was the last time I asked about medication.

8473,Never have changed my meds.
8474,"I have been cycling rapidly for the past 6 weeks, I have cut all ties with my psych and therapist, I take my meds regularly but I feel like I am going to stay manic permanently."
8475,I was in the hospital last week - my meds weren't working and the anxiety and mania were out of control.
8476,And got taken off some meds and put on a few others - including lithium.
8477,"If you feel your medication - for WHATEVER - isn't working, or that a class of drugs isn't right for you, be open and honest, and don't be afraid to insist on trying something else."
8478,"But since then, I've changed medications, been able to stop drinking, and generally just started doing all of the stuff we keep getting told to do (but often seem to not do)."
8479,"I think I'm feeling alone and just need to talk to someone - 

I am hyper-sensitive to all medications and substances (trust me, I'm the last person you wanna smoke pot with..I get super weird super fast)."
8480,"If a medication has a side effect, I experience it, even on the lowest dose possible."
8481,"It's hard to find specialists or get into see them where I live, even though it's a major city, but I feel like I should trust this guy as an internal medicine doc because he is very willing to listen to me and tweak medications, plus he's been doing research on medications to help figure things out for me."
8482,"Thus far, we've tried four different medications over the course of six months and the side effects are far outweighing the benefits each time."
8483,"I'm finally realizing that I NEED medication to function throughout my day and be successful in my life, but I always feel like I'm fighting a losing battle with the meds.. 

**EDIT: I realized just now that the rules have changed and I'm not supposed to be asking for medication help.."
8484,"like a doctor would, I'm trying to facilitate a discussion around being frustrated with medications and building a community through the ""I feel ya bro"" sense."

8488,Been trying meds and therapy for about 2.5 years.
8489,"I was diagnosed ultridian bipolar 7 years ago, was struggling with it for 7+ years before that but was prescribed Effexor XR which sent me into a spiral that nearly ruined my life and pushed me towards suicide, 6 years after that instance i sought treatment from a psychcologist who brought me back to the idea i feared that i needed medication."
8490,"My mother and I went over it 100 times before this that starting on an anti-depressant would not be a good idea and she should not let this GP prescribe that as her first option, yet this has become doctor knows best, even when this is a doctor that is not suited to be prescribing this medication and doesn't have the knowledge that this is 30+ years of symptoms and she has no idea that the other side is physical violence and verbal abuse to everyone in our familly."
8491,"And don't you worry, my pdoc is fine with my consumption of alcohol while on meds/therapy/etc."
8492,I'm EXTREMELY medication-sensitive (25mg/day of Seroquel had me sleeping 16 hours a day and hungry all the time) and I told my doctor this.
8493,The bad thing about being perceived medication when you have several psychological issues is how easy it is to abuse the numerous drugs you are prescribed.
8494,"So I have bipolar II just like the title says, and I forgot to take my sleeping meds, and was awake for a long time."
8495,I'm on meds and stable now but I keep having this intense craving for mania.
8496,It just never occured to me that this insanity i was feeling was possible caused by my medication.
8497,"And I don't want to go off my meds to spiral into mania, cause last time I did I was paranoid beyond recognition of reality."
8498,I can just move on with my life knowing he is a pedophile as well and try to stay happy with my SO until I get insurance for my meds and therapy.
8499,"I quite recently (three-ish weeks, I think) quit taking meds altogether."
8500,"They immediately sent us two to get me more medicine at the hospital, which turned out was some sort of ""tranquilizer"" and to come back to Mental Health."
8501,"So, I was then back at home, without any meds, and giving college a go with my new government college money."
8502,Happy I don't have to take bipolar meds anymore but a little angry at how much the misdiagnosis affected my life.
8503,"Even stable (because of medications), I'm on edge because I'm not the type of person who can be stable or sober and handle it."
8504,"I'm so much more stable because of the medicine and therapy, but I can't handle stability so I'm afraid that I'll never have a meaningful relationship with people again."
8505,"I'd like to seek help but im scared; my anxiety skyrockets; of what the medication will do, how much treatment would cost me (i have very low income,) and if medical treatment has come to a point where it isnt just try a dose and see what happens."
8506,"However, I've just moved home to my drug-addicted boyfriend and he pointed out that I relied on my medication in the same way and for the same reasons that he relied on the drugs."
8507,"The medication wasn't working anymore, the side-effects of starting the drug were so bad that I was afraid a re-evaluation would mean more drugs, and he was right."
8508,"I haven't told anyone, as coming off of a different medication before was a ""nightmare"" for my family and friends worrying about me, my actions and the roller-coaster ride we were all on."
8509,"I am overly aware of how substances effect me... drugs, medication, caffeine, foods..."
8510,"Unless anhedonia is a side effect of the meds, this sucks."
8511,But it could be the meds I'm on (Abilify and Lamictal).
8512,So I ran out of my meds paxil and topamax 2 days ago.
8513,I have been on sooo many medications.
8514,"(getting actual meds in a week, fucked for now.)"
8515,I've been on tons of medications.
8516,i don't think meds can cure me really.
8517,Just curious to hear how others have reacted to this medication firsthand.
8518,I'm about to go back to my psych and talk to him about me possibly having bipolar and getting some medication for it.
8519,I know there are a bunch of different meds but what kind of meds have you all had the best results with?
8520,"Before medication I was rapid cycling, and now I just feel lifeless and numb/dumb all of the time."
8521,I'd give my fucking arm just to be OK without medication.
8522,My sister is Bipolar II and is on a therapy programme and meds but has been drinking and taking drugs while out with her friends which sends her out of control.
8523,His diagnosis was that I was borderline ADHD and therefore could not get medication.
8524,"Ok, so, I've been at university studying my degree in paramedicine in another state from home (staying on campus) and I have only just started second year."
8525,meds).
8526,"I don't want medications as they just make my life a whole heap worse I had side effects from the depakote mostly - hair loss, memory fuck up, brain fog, sedation, constant tiredness, tremors and twitches."
8527,Abilify perhaps... but I really don't want psychiatric medications for the rest of my life after trying depakote/seroquel.
8528,"Apparently I have a ""severe mental illness"" and needed my meds either changed or upped."
8529,"In all seriousness, I just moved and am trying to find a pdoc asap since I'm out of my medication."
8530,I had to go without medication for a very big chunk of time because my insurance change made it impossible for me to see a psychiatrist or therapist for a bit.
8531,She was a total bitch to me because I refused to spend $900 a month on a medication my insurance at the time wouldn't cover.
8532,"I believe this is somehow due to medication in that it is keeping me stable but at the wrong level, I don't have highs any more at all it seems."
8533,Would this mean the medication I'm on isn't really working?
8534,"After switching to a couple of different meds, I would up on Buspar 30mg BID (max daily dose) and Atarax 50mg BID."
8535,"I have found recently that the Buspar doesn't seem as effective and discussed with my GP changing my meds to Xanax XR, which she didn't feel comfortable doing based on the respiratory suppression and potentially addictive nature of benzos."
8536,"She mentioned the possibility of putting me on Lamictal, which I read in an anti-seizure medication used to treat BPD."
8537,"The doctor said she'd refer me to a very good psychiatrist, but who knows how long it will be until I can get an appointment with him.....in the meantime I'm up the creek and on the max dose of a medication that really isn't doing much, if anything, to help me."
8538,"Right now, I'm taking meds, and I'm afraid I'm taking them for nothing (risperidone/epival/diphenhydramine)."
8539,"Other meds haven't worked out for me so far, so I'm thinking about asking my doctor what she thinks of Lithium."
8540,"I have a job, I'm getting a car soon, I'm on my meds and have my life pretty well together."
8541,"Okay, I had to go in for a job capacity assessment for my disability support pension today, which meant I sat down with a psychologist and told them everything, how I'm feeling how the meds are, which I know I was going to come out of feeling really crapy and emotionally drained."
8542,on meds years ago.
8543,hate meds.
8544,"If so, did you switched meds or did it fade out with time?"
8545,"needless to say, i did not take that medication again."
8546,"i had remembered something similar in my childhood from this medicine, persistent sleep paralysis, and a couple of those fainting occasions, and informed the doctor before taking it, but she said that i should anyways, and so i did."
8547,I hate being bipolar and I hate taking meds because I feel like it's admitting that there is something wrong with me.
8548,"If so, did changing meds stop them from happening?"
8549,This after not taking the meds for a week.
8550,"(To give context, I take all of my medicine, I'm type 2, and my big Spring mania is over already.)"
8551,I'm being phased off my current meds (effexor) to vybrid.
8552,I'm hoping that this new medication will restore my processing power.
8553,Let's hope that medication can take me out of the loop.
8554,"I don't like starting new meds, but who does, and I don't usually have too bad of side effects, but I'm still worried."
8555,My meds do work pretty well and I've not been that out of control  again...but I do fear it happening again.
8556,"He has even in fact, booked an appointment with a private psychologist in order to find a correct term for what I believe is some form of bi-polar, and offered even to come with me and help me understand my medication and treatment better."
8557,* What should I read first if they do recommend medication?
8558,"I always thought I'd have to take medication for the rest of my life, and I've been diagnosed with bipolar for the past 5 years so I'm pretty confused."
8559,Has anyone found a medication that treats rumination / obsessive thoughts?
8560,I'm hoping that if I continue both long term I can consider cutting back on some meds or (maybe) even getting off some of them.
8561,"There is another consideration involving medicine; though as I mentioned earlier, if you accept Western medical beliefs I am not suggesting that you suddenly forsake all doctors."
8562,This perspective is a very welcome change in the way we look at things like manic episodes and medicine.
8563,"Lithium is the 15th medication I've tried (for Anxiety and Depression, possibly Bipolar II) so I feel like I should try to stick it out but there have been zero positive effects and it's making me so uncomfortable."
8564,One of my goals was to stay off multiple meds.
8565,"Saying ""she's off her meds"" is not helping."
8566,"PS: if anyone could give me some basic info on anxiety meds (if you take them regularly or not, what kinds of meds etc.)"
8567,"So I'm already on medication that I need to survive, and constantly paranoid about not being able to get it."
8568,I’ve started my own therapy and she’s asked me for at least six months to get her medications dialed in and her own therapy a chance to work….but I don’t know if I’m already too far gone.
8569,"Unfortunately, because insurance companies are corrupt, she ended up on a medicine that allowed her body to absorb the lithium at a higher rate."
8570,What medications do you take?
8571,"My meds have been doing wonders for over a year now, so the fact that I'm so wobbly at this point is confusing me."
8572,I truly believe that without my medication I would have eventually committed suicide or have made a poor decision from impaired judgement.
8573,"With my psychiatrist's permission, I went off all my medication due to side effects."
8574,"I have been completely off my medication for over a week now, and have been having a rough go of it."
8575,"the dishes are crusted, laundry is piled and smelling like the trash, I look over at my meds and consider taking all of them."
8576,"Anyways, this most recent semester the meds I was taking stopped working and I started cycling again."
8577,The doctor is going to try medication first.
8578,"Just wanted to check in with everyone and say that just because you aren't in full on crisis, don't be afraid to change meds to get you to a better state of living."
8579,Getting a second opinion on my medicine has made all the difference in the world.
8580,"My meds are the only thing keeping me from having the suicidal ideations that would feel like slipping into a warm bath, comfortable and familiar."
8581,They changed my meds this week and i think thats why... they doubled my snri's without regulating my mood stabilizers.
8582,Am I the only person here who was diagnosed early (third grade) and put on medication that actually helped?
8583,"I am (mostly) stable, and have been off my medications for nearly a year, but I only got to the point where I felt secure enough in my head that I could find out what would happen if I went off my meds because my family supported me and sacrificed a lot to help me get and stay stable."
8584,That the medicine and therapy will be successful and I will go on to lead a less effed up life.
8585,"Hello people…
Recently I took the drastic decision to stop taking my medicines by my own."
8586,"I took many medicines together during the last years… Like litium, quetiapine and paxil… Among others."
8587,"Guys I really want to get away from these medicines, I’ve been taking pills for depression for so long, I got fat and kind dumb."
8588,I know depression is a disease like others and need to keep in treatment and maybe I will never will be like other people BUT medicines no more for me.
8589,Is there any other meds that i should ask my doctor about to help fight this depression?
8590,"Anyway two weeks ago I was referred to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with Bipolar 1, however said I needed to be referred to a group of doctors and nurses that could help me more, well efficiently I guess, along with being told they will put me on a couple of meds."
8591,"I ended up drinking a bottle and a half of wine last night, whilst on all my normal meds and painkillers, and apparantly I was a different person."
8592,I don't want to turn to alcohol every time when I can't control the mania; I lost my temper BADLY with several people last night and I seriously seriously debated just taking all my meds and taking the easy way out.
8593,"i've been off of meds for so long, i'm not sure how it will go."
8594,I know I need to stop taking drugs and stay on top of my meds.
8595,Anyone have any tips on working out on these medications?
8596,"He didn't recommend any meds or anything like that, just tracking my hypo/depression moods like I'm already doing."
8597,I have had to change up my meds a bunch and I have developed this nasty sleep eating disorder (working on it through cbt.)
8598,"I haven't taken my meds in 2 days, and am about to go to a concert."
8599,"I've been taking my meds and getting enough sleep...

What do you guys think?"
8600,"All my stabilizing meds stopped helping me about two Decembers back, and it's been massive trial and error for new medication since(And a suicide attempt/hospitalization in between 'em.)"
8601,"Based on my responses to hospitalizations, various sorts of therapy and medication, I've been looking for long term mental health facilities for a month or two long stay in hopes of seeing my hunch on potential improvement form a reality."
8602,* Does ADD medication work for us?
8603,Will ADD meds help?
8604,"Today I'm super jittery, partly because I made up for that lost sleep and missed a few doses of my anti-anxiety meds and another for realizing what I did...Not even sure what I'm going to do with that sex toy that ordered... ."
8605,"I do not abuse any substances, and take my medication on time, 98% of the time."
8606,She recently stopped taking her meds and has been very hard to deal with lately.
8607,"Since I know about her not taking her meds I do my best to keep my emotions in check, (I have slight anger issues that cause me to lose control of my actions) and I have been able to do so very successfully in comparison to how I've been."
8608,"A day it hit me (6 months ago), I knew I was bipolar and got this mania from ssri, but I didnt want to quit the med, I tried to control myself but failed, so 3 months ago I decided to go to the doc again, diagnosed bipolar disorder, dropped all my meds, gave me quetiapine which made me useless and sleppy for 1.5 weeks, so my dosis was lowered and now have it only to sleep, and then Lithium which Im currently taking, now the problem is, the doc doesnt want to give me sertraline yet, I believe I cant live without it, I can say all my anxiety problems came back, obviously I can handle them way better, but its hard for me, I dont like to be in crowded places, cant make a presentation, and im depressed, bread tastes like shit, I can't study, music sucks, its hard for me to watch a movie, nothing makes sense, and I feel alone, thought lithium would help me feel better, not cure my anxiety, but at least feel happy with my life, the thing is I dont think I will ever achieve stability, its like Anti depressants or not (mania or depression), my doc wants to try sertraline and lithium once i get 0.6+ in my blood, honestly I dont think it will work (i will get too maniac)."
8609,Has anyone else had depression episodes while on this medication?
8610,"But being in a depressive swing and halfway through a 16 oz each 6 pack (bad idea for self-medication, I know) its driving me fucking nuts."
8611,I'm on minimal medication.
8612,"The depression is setting in deep, and the new meds are not helping with school."
8613,"Luckily I am not blowing money on alcohol or something for my computer, so at least the meds are taming my hypomania."
8614,So last Monday I visited my pdoc to discuss a change in medication due to day time sedation.
8615,Anyways my pdoc mentioned during this conversation that he thought I might not actually need long term medication because I'm already on a low dose and I haven't shown symptoms since my initial manic episode a year ago.
8616,"Depression lately because I honestly don't feel like my meds are working for that, but that's another story."
8617,"It used to be hypomania often when I was stressed, but I'm pretty sure I AM on very good meds for that."
8618,"In and out of hospitals, clinics, on and off meds, relapse, screwed up relationships, professional and personal, the whole shebang."
8619,"Like when I remember the time I was a giant alcoholic piece of shit (read self-medicating) because I had no idea what was going on, back before I got real meds to help sort me out..yeah that went over well.. there's no need to go into more detail."
8620,"I was on medication twice, and went off them twice, due to lack of insurance."
8621,"This is all fine, but I was put on meds a few weeks ago."
8622,Then I started my meds.
8623,And I'm worried it's because of the meds.
8624,But it is a choice I know I have to make because with my physical medical conditions i need to monitored while trying new medicines.....
8625,I took my meds at 10 PM and was done with everything I had to do by 11:00.
8626,The meds are helpful for the manic symptoms but they've done nothing for the depression.
8627,"By day two off both meds, I became very excitable."
8628,I calmed down a day or so after starting the meds again.
8629,"I feel like it was too soon after stopping meds to go that way, and for it to end so suddenly."
8630,That I want to try other meds I had researched myself.
8631,"Ask me different questions, question the diagnosis and why the meds weren't working."
8632,no more self medication.
8633,"The last few weeks it seemed like my medication wasn't working as I was wanting to kill myself often and being ultra-depressed, so I stopped taking the lithium and I feel great."
8634,I called him out and asked him which one he is diagnosing me with because treatment (medication) is different for depression vs bipolar.
8635,"I am still that same person, and now that I am getting my medicine under control I am operating on a stable platform again."
8636,I quit all my medications about 4 weeks ago and went into an extreme manic episode where I went into delirium.
8637,"After a couple of brutally honest sessions, she informed me that in her opinion I am ""textbook bipolar,"" and that she thinks it is ""imperative"" I try a mood stabilizing medication."
8638,"I'm amenable to the idea of doing anything I can to improve my situation, because I feel like I am losing control of my life; however, I've never really taken a prescription medication other than antibiotics, and I'm pretty scared about how this type of drug will affect me."
8639,Edit:  I probably should've said more than just hitting some of the manic highlights - to flesh out why my psychiatrist wants me to take medication - but I wasn't sure if anyone would want to bother reading a tome about my issues.
8640,"I regained my functionality but I also started risking my sanity again – drinking, mixing drugs, stealing, going off medicine and then going back on right before I hit crisis mode."
8641,"I don't know what part of me isnine, what part of me belongs to my illness, and what part of me is a product of the medications."
8642,"He usually takes his meds, but he needs more help."
8643,"I was wondering about any unintended consequences of doing psyches while on these medications, or just my condition in general."
8644,"After being told the news, and as I am I between coming off my anti depressants and going onto new meds, I have just got home from the worst high weekend I have ever had, I feel really uncomfortable talking about it and I am envious of the courage people have on here."
8645,"I'm not taking anything other meds at the moment, as I was just recently diagnosed as type 2."
8646,"I've normally attributed it to the fact that I've gained 75 lbs in 7 years, but now I'm wondering if the aches can be attributed to side effects of *all* of the medications I've tried, or the disorder itself."
8647,She says she wont do anything to my meds for six months because apparently that's how long I have to fucking stay clean before she can see if there's really something wrong with me mentally and not the drugs.
8648,What she fucking doesn't understand is I would have no fucking problem staying clean if I didn't get depressed and I'm getting depressed because my fucking meds aren't working but she doesn't understand that.
8649,"**Thanks for posting :)

Edit:Edit: Regardless of what trends this post\poll may reveal, always check with your doctor before altering your meds."
8650,"Seeing as lithium is the only medication that I've changed directly leading to this, I have not taken it today ( I will take it again tomorrow at a lower dose and contact my doctor)."
8651,I know that lithium gets a bad rap from many but it does more to pull me out of bad places than any other medication has ever done.
8652,"My psychiatrist said that I am probably (type II) and I got prescribed medication, so this is new."
8653,"I've taken different meds - they seem to decrease the severity of hypomanic phases, but only short term help on depressive side - so it's really better to not take them in order to get a hypo break from the depression."
8654,"I appreciate the care and help here, but I promise this is a choice I've come to over years, even with counseling and medication."
8655,It seems like the medication I'm on is starting to work.
8656,They didn't change my meds (I'm on geodon and valium).
8657,"Can we have a page or a link to a 'before you post, here's a list of standard British/American Medical English abbreviations' because 'BP meds' are *very* different to 'BD meds', and it gets really confusing."
8658,I don't want to have to take medicine for the rest of my life :(
8659,"SO, I've decided that once my finals are done I'm going to talk to my psychiatrist about ADD medication."
8660,"However, I'm really afraid that being put on such medication would increase the likelihood of triggering a manic episode."
8661,"I'm curious about what all of your experiences are with ADD medication and if any of you have been successful with it, specifically those on lamictal."
8662,"TL;DR: I'm a college student taking 75mg lamictal, not doing as good as I would like to in school as far as studying/focusing, and am curious about ADD medication"
8663,I know constant medication and therapy support groups and coping mechanisms and it will get better.
8664,"I've considered popping Aderall as a last ditch effort, but I'm weary of mixing meds."
8665,I wasn't very good at taking my meds in the beginning.
8666,Since being diagnosed and taking medication/therapy I have decided to go back into dating.
8667,"I took the meds as ordered, religously.. even though i fought him on trying to reduce the dose, which he sort of complied with.. but i kept taking them, cuz i said i would."
8668,.. so I stopped taking my psych meds.
8669,"With the intent of ""find a better job, get benefits, get back on meds."""
8670,"I kept a stash of a few weeks worth of my meds, knowing that i'd lose access to them, including antipsychotics and mood stabilizers."
8671,"landed in the hospital.. 

.. found out that by the time i started taking my 'stash' of meds, i was far enough gone that i didnt realize i was taking the -wrong- med.. i was taking the mood stabilizers.. not the antipsychotics."
8672,.. no money.. no benefits.. no meds.
8673,"I'm currently in therapy, and about to talk to a psychiatrist to get meds."
8674,I want the meds.
8675,"But the counselor keeps hitting me over the head with 'you need to take your meds, a lot of bipolar people get better when they take their meds and decide they dont need them.'"
8676,"I want to have, and to take the meds."""
8677,"Sooo... with the ""I'm on a manic swing, but its okay, I can handle it"".. does that mean it's bad enough that I need to start taking my meds?"
8678,"However, today I had a pretty strange strong mood swing that came out of nowhere (just like it used to before getting on meds, except then it was wayyy stronger and wayyy more often)...."
8679,I've just recently gained the funds (and courage) to start medication for my bipolar disorder.
8680,"I've never taken medication like this before, and I'm extremely nervous."
8681,"Was still impotent so I wanted to switch, got put on Seroquel, had some weird dreams, decided in October 2012 to stop taking my medications."
8682,"Since then I have not been taking medications (so ~1 year), and I have debated quite a few times whether to go see a professional because I feel a lot of problems are latent but I do an excellent job of shutting them out."
8683,"Basically I don't really know whether getting help is what I want/need, because for the past year I have been managing OK without meds or therapy."
8684,The meds didn't help.
8685,"I was ashamed that, after all I had been through, years of therapy and different medications, I was still no more a functioning person than I ever was."
8686,"I realized that, as things stood, I was better off unmedicated than I was on current meds."
8687,"After three years of struggling with new medications and the burden of school and commuting daily, I am *whole."
8688,Don't ever give up trying to find the right medication.
8689,"I am on medication, and my manic states aren't usually this bad."
8690,"Anyway, in part due to forgetting to take my medication on a regular schedule thanks to work and the situation with my former counselor I find myself in this endless cycle of uncontrollable rage where I go from freaking out about one minor thing to the next or even freaking out about things that haven't even happened but are purely based on potential situations which could occur."
8691,I took my medication this morning and I'm planning on taking a couple of extra lorazepam to calm my nerves which I know I shouldn't do but I'm stuck on what I can do to improve my situation in the short term.
8692,"As a result, I decided to stay away from meds and try the cognitive behavioral therapy route."
8693,"Anyway, return to my question, does anyone here have experience with this medication?"
8694,"Please excuse grammar and syntax issues if they exist, as I said the medication makes me sleepy, and I'm typing on my phone"
8695,"I see my doctor again in 5 days, but I know he'll just put me on yet another medicine."
8696,Last time I visited him he says i can go down to two medicines which i forgot the name of.
8697,One of my biggest life goals is to get off the medicine or get down to one or two max medicines once a day at least.
8698,I've overcome a lot with my illness and getting the right medication.
8699,"I stopped taking my medication probably over a month ago, and feel more or less the same as I always do, in fact more on the good side most of the time if I try hard enough to stay positive."
8700,"I have some step siblings that have the illness on a much more extreme level as me, but it's easily managed with medications for them."
8701,I've asked their experiences but their medications have a lot to do with it.
8702,"And the tricky part for me is, I'm allergic to almost every medication used to treat Bipolar disorder."
8703,"I've experienced nearly all of those odd and ridiculious side-effects medications can do to you, and one one occasion I nearly died due to the reaction of the medications."
8704,"I tried for around 2 years all the medications my Psychiatrist prescribed, and all were lethal."
8705,"We both eventually decided that medication was not a possibility for me, and I would have to find other ways to manage it."
8706,"Do you live without medications, or what medications worked for you?"
8707,"That is for certain and so is the schizoid personality disorder, OCD personality disorder, ADHD mix type (which without meds is obnoxious....) GAD and a few specific phobias."
8708,I said besides adhd meds yes.
8709,I'm so frustrated because I'm on all these medicines that are suppose to make me not depressed but I still am.
8710,"I was DX'd in 2011 with bipolar 2. after a bunch of different meds  not working (or working for x amount of time and suddenly not working) I'm on the hunt for a new batch (currently on 200mg of seroquel, but need to go up to 300mg)."
8711,I'm on a tight budget so finding meds is getting hard (and getting harder).
8712,and I've checked interactions and crazymeds.us for what they say.
8713,"You can be compliment with meds for many years, but once grandiosity hits, you can stop believing you're bipolar at all, in fact you're super human."
8714,"Family members can call crying begging for you to take your meds, reminding you how much damage mania has done in the past, and all you can return with is a ""Fuck off, you need medication, not me""."
8715,My daughter is supposed to be on medication and going to counseling.
8716,Been on the medication about a month now for the lamotrigine and about 3 for the antidepressants and still feel no different than beforehand.
8717,Been here for a month and slowly but surely my parents are trying to wear me down and convince me to drop the medication.
8718,"I can't take the dosage of medication I need because it causes speech and memory issues, so I have to cope with what bipolar I'm left with."
8719,"I started medication at the beginning of January, first on Lamictal and Latuda, Ativan for anxiety."
8720,Do I even need to be on medication?
8721,"I started taking medication, but my manic episodes were sometimes just a beast no medication could tame."
8722,"Yes, I know change your thoughts change your life, and it does work but when I talk to my friend who is bi polar, ( who does take his medication btw ) It just seems like his life seems to be a little bit less stressful."
8723,She went back to the doctor as she knows something is very wrong and he gave her some new medicine.
8724,She told me a couple weeks ago that she's going to try not taking her meds and I wasn't sure if that was a good idea but didn't question her.
8725,On fixing these symptoms:  I think the right meds and lifestyle can help both of these.
8726,Don't feel fuzzy or anything and no change in meds.
8727,"As i struggle with this my brother has been digging at me for being on lithium, he knows how much i hate taking medication and how hard it was on my ego to admit i needed help let alone take medications."
8728,Can the meds getting use to new doses cause this?
8729,"He should be taking his medication once a day, but he takes it every couple, because he hates the idea of being stuck/dependent on medication for the rest of his life."
8730,"I guess it might seem to him like it makes him a much less able person to do things, than a person who does not take medication."
8731,It may be caused by him not taking his meds as often as he should be (and therefore making him react worse to any negative comment from her side).
8732,I managed to catch up but my money just kinda got away from me and I could no longer pay for my medication which caused me to just fall behind again.
8733,I'm not sure how much of this slip is down to being off medication and how much is down to going from being in a loving environment full of friends to a ridiculously bloody lonely existence.
8734,"I've been cruising on a manic episode since late April, my meds only slightly suppress it as I told my psych I couldn't risk upping the dosage."
8735,"It will never go away, no matter how many different medications we try, it won't ever stop."
8736,Is this a side effect of meds?
8737,My psychiatrist and therapist told me I am bi-polar (and that it wasn't a bad reaction to medication.)
8738,"It seems a lot of people who try to handle their bi-polar disorder without medication fail, but you always hear the negative stories over positive."
8739,I have never seen a therapist for any of this and I don't want to be on medication.
8740,"Since then, I've been more consistent with taking my medication, attending my appointments, and caring for myself."
8741,"I never thought id feel this way about a medication, it shows how amazing it is and the change its allowed me to have."
8742,I made the decision to self-manage my symptoms and go off of all the medication I was on.
8743,I hated the way they made me feel and I really didn't want to be on medication the rest of my life.
8744,EDIT: Going back on medication is not an option.
8745,The paragraph closed with admonishing that the bipolar person (me) is too much for anyone to handle including me (before or after medication?
8746,"Thank you

EDIT: this seems to happen every few days, I do NOT skip my meds"
8747,Since then everything seemed fine as she was taking her medicine daily and we've been happy since (we're together for 5 months now).
8748,Now she had the meeting resceduled for monday morning and she picked up her medicine and I asked if she was going to be okay and she confirmed.
8749,Does it go away after a while or do I need to change meds?
8750,"I was admitted into in a psychiatric hospital, put on tons of meds and miraculously none of them did anything positive for me."
8751,"Ever since then I have refused to see a therapist, refused to be on meds and I have even refused to accept that I have any type of ailment."
8752,I know it's a shit ton of meds.
8753,"That's a major turn-around, and I know I owe it mostly to successful diagnosis, medication, and therapy."
8754,I don't take my ADHD meds when I have no work and since today was a holiday no work no meds.
8755,"About a month ago, my doc raised one of my doses on my medication, because I was extremely depressed and was doing the whole what's the point of living thing."
8756,i know this makes no sense and is probably insane but its how i feel on this medication.
8757,Every time I've been on meds they either don't work or give me horrible side effects.
8758,I feel the pharmeceutical people don't understand brain function enough to develop healthy meds that aren't going to damage my organs in some fashion.
8759,If I take all my medicine will it kill me?
8760,How has medication changed your symptoms?
8761,"Like I got permission to change my medicine a bit, I make myself sleep longer if I'm hypomanic, that kind of thing."
8762,I'm about to tell my parents that I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and am taking medication for it.
8763,"As I kid, I once heard my dad say something to the effect of ""people who take medication just don't want to deal with their problems"" and ""you can't control how you feel, but you can control what you do."""
8764,"I even went to the doctor (thanks to you guys for the help with that), and I got some medication that used to help me sleep..."
8765,"The worst part of this all is that I know once my medications start kicking in, I'll lose this happiness."
8766,So it's no surprise that here on day 2 of the new medication I've broken out into hives.
8767,"Is there a way to tell if this is related to the medicine, or if it's just plain jane hives that I get for any myriad of reasons?"
8768,"So, likely the disability is going to be extended well past my next appt, possibly into March depending on how new meds go."
8769,"I'm open to trying new stuff, but not trying new meds AND working (just because I'd rather be at home where a flipout won't get me fired and my fiancee can watch for bad side effects), so going back before I know the meds work AND don't have bad side effects is the priority."
8770,"Since Welbutrin is evidently out of the picture now, not sure about Abilify, and others I've tried are obviously out, any suggestions on new meds?"
8771,"I'm taking my medication, but I'm just so damn tired."
8772,"I""m also off my meds, which I know, bad move.The only positive is that I've been going to group and individual therapy for the past year, so I think it's taught me to have a better hold on not being impulsive and binging on alcohol or drugs like I used to."
8773,"I read that the 'negative' (1 of the 2 categories) symptoms of schizophrenia- which ""blunted (or) flat affect"" falls under, are incurable and there are no meds for it."
8774,"And this is exactly what being in the depths of a horrible depression felt like, before my meds."
8775,"I know I can live around this, with proper help and medication."
8776,The unpredictability makes it difficult to treat effectively with medication.
8777,"So, due to some staffing changes at the clinic where I get my medication, my prescriptions ran out and I was off Effexor for 3 days."
8778,I'm starting to get frustrated about these meds and the side effects but I also try to remember what it was like not to be on anything (crippling depression at times and then easy irritable other times).
8779,I stopped all meds 2 months ago.
8780,"I've only recently been diagnosed and due to the fact I don't get manic and have only wanted to actually die a couple of times in the past few years I've decided to stay off medication, but I've started really doubting my career choice and if it's even possible."
8781,I moved out of state so I no longer qualified for state benefits and went off my meds.
8782,"After the first month it wasn't so bad and everybody around me said I was doing better off the meds and I felt better, even during the down swings, so I believed them."
8783,I started taking it again in April after a miscarriage because I KNEW my brain was not going to be taking this well so I got on the medication the next day.
8784,"Also, since SJS weakens your immune system I got bronchitis and my doctor doesn't want me to begin a new medicine until I get over this and quit taking antibiotics."
8785,Basically they were only allowed to talk treatment options because my mom understands the medicine better than I do and what will or will not put me in organ failure.
8786,"Looking to meet up as firstly a catch up with other people in similar circumstance and secondly to investigate together therapies, meds, lifestyle etc (yes I am anti med, and no it wont be a group advocating this, different strokes for different folks!)."
8787,I've gone a year so far without bipolar meds.
8788,I haven't taken ADHD meds in years because they exacerbate my bipolar symptoms.
8789,"My psychiatrist says he thinks I'm okay, but I think I might need medication again."
8790,I'm not sure if I should continue taking this medicine.
8791,No medication.
8792,Same thing for my medicine.
8793,To answer the preemptive question on why not try another medication: because it works for my depression and I would rather chop it up and snort it than have the side effects I've had from the alternatives.
8794,"(And in case you would like to know my meds I am on lithium 1200, lamotragine 100mg.)"
8795,"She takes her meds now, a vast improvement from when we first met, but she is still somewhat unbalanced, although I hesitate to use that term."
8796,"I'm prescribed these medications:

Lithium - 600mg, once a day

Lamictal - 200mg, once a day

Seroquel XR - 150mg, once a day (at night, obviously)

Effexor XR - 225mg, once a day (doesn't bother my stomach)

Xanax - 0.5mg, as needed"
8797,We have been together for about 4 months and I have been good at hiding it when I feel down/have been pretty stable on my current meds.
8798,"I have been ill since 2009, and from 2010 I've been constantly taking medications - anti psychotic Olanzapine is the only one of them that hasn't changed in the course of time."
8799,"My regular meds seem to fail, even though I have just been put on SNRI this week, and while on holiday I felt the difference."
8800,After 3 or 4 years of the same medication working moderately well why does it all of a sudden feel like I am not taking it anymore suddenly?
8801,I have an alarm and take it nightly and have to fight thoughts that my pills aren't real pills or there was a mix up and my medicine is all placebo or I'm being tricked so everyone can see there is nothing wrong with me to there also being nothing wrong with me and my medication is what is wrong after all and I'm killing myself with it by fooling people into thinking I have an illness.
8802,my doctor has adjusted my medication as of yesterday so I suspect it will be better but why after years of a shakey alliance with my illness is my body like screw you pills were gonna do what we want?
8803,I'm usually very good without any medication but it's becoming to much right at this moment and I don't want to break.
8804,"""You're bipolar and need medication."""
8805,"Tomorrow I start a job I'm way overqualified for (first trigger), which means dealing with new people (second trigger) and it means putting my kid in daycare for the first time (third trigger), all the while being on the lowest doses of medicines in years (we're slowly scrapping the playbook)."
8806,"I can function at work, go out with friends to non trigger places, take my meds and stay away from drugs/alcohol."
8807,"He's a lot better now, and they've found some medication that, at last, seems to work (lithium) and he's finally actually *got* a diagnosis (3 years of undecided doctors)."
8808,"I had to say yes, and then you, you fucking douchecanoe piece of shit forgot my fucking meds."
8809,"Meeting with my doc on tuesday to overhaul my care, I need new meds and a new treatment plan, I know that."
8810,"Something about her doesn't sit well with me, and she's not very open to taking medication requests from patients."
8811,I have tried many meds and SSRI's work best for me.
8812,"I knew he was going off his meds, asked if he talked to his doctor first, he said yes."
8813,"I know the medicine was really expensive, like $800."
8814,"I want to ask him if he's okay, how he is without meds, and if he'd consider going back on them?"
8815,"So, when I got out of the hospital I left with a fifteen-day supply of the new meds they put me on."
8816,"I went a month without medication once, despite submitting myself to the hospital charity pharmacy with the prescription in-hand, because I didn't have paperwork proving I'd tried typical antipsychotics before going on an atypical."
8817,Since the medication started working.
8818,"I've just been prescribed Seroquel and I know meds affect everyone differently, but I'm curious about peoples experiences with it if anyone wants to share."
8819,Put me on meds that I didn't really want but I was really pressured by family.
8820,"I regularly take my medication, been doing so for over 5 years, but while they work (kinda, for the most part), I still struggle every day."
8821,My pdoc is wanting to try me on a non-stimulant ADD medication.
8822,"The doctor who will be doing the procedure says that there should be no danger of going under while on the meds, and I'm trusting her on this and trying to keep anxiety down."
8823,Has anyone here had surgery while on their meds?
8824,I am still taking my meds (that have been giving me a constant migraine for about 5 months) and I am going to try to start doing shit to control my anger but I'm SO depressed.
8825,Does anyone else have experience with this medicine and how did it affect you?
8826,I was medicated for 2 years (had my strongest mania ever during that time) along with some counseling at the end when they removed the meds.
8827,If the medication might make me more 'normal' I am entering a whole new world and kinda need to re-learn myself.
8828,Then add all my as needed meds if I get sick.
8829,Going to try tonight without sleeping meds.
8830,She was diagnosed right when we started dating and has just recently changed her medication.
8831,"After 2 and a half years in college, 5 days in hospital from one of my worst episode, dropped and failed couple classes, and gone through a lot of meds (Prozac, Celexa, Wellbutrin, Lithium, Risperidone, Ativan, and Lamictal) since February to find the right combination on September (Depakote and Vistaril), today I got a notice that I got 3 As, and a B this semester, which is the most successful semester since I started college."
8832,This is the first time my mind hasn't been racing...it could be the meds are stabilizing me...it could be the liquid codeine.
8833,I thought I had more refills left on my medications but they ran out about 2 weeks back.
8834,I've been having a hell of a time without my meds and I've been trying to get an appointment with a new Dr in the area but trying to work with insurance and scheduling has me freaking out a bit since it seems like the earliest I'll get an appointment is mid-August.
8835,What can I do to get back on my meds faster?
8836,I know I need a med review anyways (I've been slowly getting worse over the last year or so) but I really need to be back on my meds ASAP to be even vaguely functional.
8837,i know of a place where i could get diagnosed but i would hate counseling (because of the social anxiety) and i think having medication might trigger suicidal thoughts (overdosing).
8838,Now I am recently unemployed and there was a HUGE mix-up with my GP and my medications.
8839,I have all of my meds and I didn’t have to go without.
8840,I am just not sure that now that I have all this time to think about these things that I am spinning myself up or if I am breaking through my meds and on the way to a breakdown.
8841,"I recently found out that my dad, who I haven't talked to in about two years, at some point in his life was diagnosed with what my mom, sister, and I believe to be bipolar disorder and was receiving treatment for that for around a year until he decided that he didn't want to take the medication anymore."
8842,The only thing we have to go on were his rapid mood fluctuations and the medication he was taking was a mood stabilizer.
8843,"I got so caught up in the greatness of life and how good I felt, that I began forgetting to take my meds."
8844,"I quickly got back on my meds schedule, but it was too late."
8845,Lately I feel that things are getting worse so I just want to see if any of you think maybe this is worth getting a formal diagnosis and start medication.
8846,"As for me, I am a 22 year old male to female trans person that have been on hormones for over a year so I've been relatively ""stable"" medication wise, and a lot of these things have been happening at least until my senior year of high school (about 4-5 years ago)."
8847,"I've been on medications before (Clonazepam, Wellbutrin, Buspar, Abilify, Lexapro) and honestly I am absolutely TERRIFIED of taking medication."
8848,Doc said after another 18 months he'd consider recommending coming off the medication.
8849,I've been anti-medication since my diagnosis and have been trying to come off it.
8850,"Seroquel used to work great for balance, but ever since I truly accepted myself, I realized I just can't take certain meds that make me introverted and lazy."
8851,"I'm actually not on meds but I have an appointment tomorrow, and I do not see a therapist but I would like to."
8852,"I am on medication,  but they hardly work, see psychiatrist and psychologist but it hardly helps."
8853,"I have problems where to find help often times, and a lot of questions unanswered about my illness, medication and what not."
8854,Another thing is I have a sentence by law to follow my medication and my psychiatrist advice or there will be used force against me to do so.
8855,"My psychiatrist kind of exploits this threatening me to do stuff like do the new meds or have me hospitalized, I am dead scared of this much more than going to jail..."
8856,"Recently I ran out of meds, I'm between psychiatrists."
8857,Things get under my skin more easily when I'm off my meds so I only brought this situation up to my circle recently.
8858,You need to take your medicine.
8859,"I have had awful reactions to meds (depression, suicidal voices, etc."
8860,"I never fully believed that I had bipolar disorder, but I would rather be safe than sorry, so I always took my medication."
8861,I decided to wean my self off of my medication and test it out for two weeks.
8862,After those two weeks I would decide whether I should go back on my medication or continue without it.
8863,It's been about four and a half months since I last took my medication.
8864,* Note: Prior to stopping taking my medication I had been stable (no depression) for 9-10 months (September 2012 to June 2013).
8865,"* So I'm wondering:
Should I tell my NP that I stopped taking my medication?"
8866,"I'm generally fairly compliant - i take most of my meds, though for some reason stopped my lithium, and am pretty good about going to pdoc appointments and taking their advice."
8867,"I know a few other people with bipolar who aren't compliant at all - reasons ranging from 'can't be bothered', 'won't help', 'want to do it without meds' etc."
8868,"First let me state my diagnosis and medications to clear that one up Bipolar I, PTSD, 600MG Seroquil, 1500 MG Depakote .5 mg of Kolonopin twice daily for 30 days."
8869,"I just got my official diagnosis a few weeks ago, and just this past Monday agreed to get on meds."
8870,"Anyway, my question is, once you guys went on medication, did you find it was easier to stick to a routine?"
8871,I go to the shrink tomorrow and while my meds are working is it wrong to mention that financially I want to try something else?
8872,"But I also have other concerns about my medication, how do I bring it up?"
8873,"Sometimes we'll get an angry customer (I work for your least favorite wireless company) and my coworkers will joke, ""she must have forgotten her bipolar medication"" and it makes me shudder."
8874,But lately I stopped taking my meds.
8875,And so I got back on the meds.
8876,"Now, my life changed a shit ton in those 2 weeks, and even on the meds that confidence still kind of lingered."
8877,"So, after about a month of being on the meds it was back to zombie mode."
8878,I don't know if it's because my medication stopped working or it's just me that became...this.
8879,I am an ex-qualified paramedic and still studying medicine right now (retrieval) by distance.
8880,"I just feel so discouraged, I've tried so many different medications but none have been able to keep stable for long."
8881,"(also tried several antidepressants before my diagnosis and those made thing MUCH worse) My pdoc mentioned other antipsychotics (risperdol,geodon), but I am so afraid of those medications."
8882,"Anyways, they diagnosed her and the first meds they put her on, put her into a downward spiral."
8883,"Now she is on a different medication, and she is doing MUCH better, but still has constant suicidal thoughts."
8884,She told me (while on the first medication.
8885,"There have to be others out there that have felt this way and then found the right medication and ""everything changed""."
8886,I think my meds are about to get adjusted...
8887,I am finally mentally free with my medication that I take everyday.
8888,Has anyone noticed their grades improved after medication?
8889,"I feel like if I could get a therapist and monitored meds I could probably right the train, but it's dangerously close to jumping the tracks and I can't afford to eat at the moment, let alone seek medical attention."
8890,"I have spent time inpatient, I have had mental health evaluations, I've worked through meds, it's been a long battle that I'd love to see through, but I can't afford any sort of healthcare at the moment...I feel backed into a corner

I was told by a medical professional that I am very likely manic depressive type 2 (with definite PTSD from childhood) when I had my evaluation and I've been through a wide variety of meds, but I'm not sure if I've ever been officially diagnosed as manic depressive, or if such a thing even exists, and I feel like I need a new look to see if that is the only thing going on, because I've almost completely lost my ability to self motivate in a productive manner."
8891,I am 28 and have been on and off medication since I was 14.
8892,A couple years ago I was seeing a medication manager who put me on Lamictal.
8893,"It worked so great that the reoccurring ""I don't need meds anymore I feel fine"" hit me and I stopped taking meds."
8894,The past two years has been a roller coaster from hell (as usually happens) and it's only when I am depressed do I know that I need to get back on my medication.
8895,About a week ago she lost her meds and has not taken them since.
8896,"Her mom pays for them and she said she was going to try and go without meds, because her mom would be mad that she lost them."
8897,I remember what it was like before I got the right meds.
8898,"Well, I am yet to be diagnosed with anything (as my psychiatrist wasn't 100% sure if it was bipolar or just plain depression) but I do not really care even if I'm diagnosed and end up taking medications the rest of my life."
8899,I'm pretty sure now that I'm getting 6 hours on average that I can quit the meds and lose the weight.
8900,"In case I need to get back on meds, what med should I ask for that will control my mood and not make me fat?"
8901,"Part of what caused this, I later discovered, was being put on the wrong medication."
8902,"I have been put on a few different medications, most recently Abilify (starting about 18 months ago, ending 10 months ago)."
8903,"I'm looking to make an appointment with yet another psychiatrist but I'm a bit hesitant because:

-I'm worried I will be put back on meds that will adversely affect me sexually."
8904,Since then I have been on a lot of different medications.
8905,I cut down hard on the number of meds I'm taking and things are going great.
8906,"As a result, I forced myself to never feel guilt... Is it possible that my medication is causing a return?"
8907,I'm fairly vocal here about the fact that I choose not to stay on meds.
8908,"I know this doesn't mean everything is over, I still want them to change my meds... maybe not take so much seroquel, but start a mood stabilizer too."
8909,Having had enough of “comfortably numb” he went off his meds without asking his doctor even though I begged him to at least call the doc.
8910,"Hi r/bipolar,
I'm bipolar 1 and I'm not currently on medication or in therapy (I have an appointment with a new person tomorrow, the last person I saw diagnosed me but told me I didn't need medication and I was totally fine, when I went to him literally begging for help)."
8911,"I know that factor is huge in how I'm feeling generally, but I just wanted to see if any of you had felt this way with or without medication."
8912,"I've been with my boyfriend for almost a year, and he's amazing and totally understanding of all my stuff because he has MDD and speculative PTSD (he's on medication but not in therapy)."
8913,Prob doesn't help I've gone off my meds.
8914,I need to find a psychiatrist because I know if I talk to my Doctor about changing medication she'll just recommend more vitamins.
8915,I prob should start seeing my psychologist again and get a psychiatrist to prescribe me new medication.
8916,"So I guess I generally have way more manic episodes than low ones, although my medication for the mania is constantly being increased so it's somewhat under control."
8917,Two are anti seizure medicine and one is to stop the tremors associated with Parkinson's.
8918,I can submit the medication I'm on to give a better idea.
8919,I've been working closely with my pdoc and my therapist trying to find the right balance of meds and to figure out what needs to change in my life.
8920,I work in a pharmacy and talked to my boss about it and she thinks my doc may have just started me out on too high of a dose but I was wondering if anyone else has had trouble with this medication so I can tell my doctor if I wanna try a lower dose or just try something else for mood stabilization.
8921,"Also, I think I should tell my psych about this mixed episode, but I know it's going to consist of me having another medication thrown in, but I didn't have good reactions to the last two I was prescribed."
8922,I have been diagnosed for and taking medications for the last several years.
8923,But while high I must have taken about two weeks worth of medication at once and then cooked some dinner.
8924,If my medications had not been so subtle some real damage could have been done.
8925,I should not have taken the two weeks of medication the way I did.
8926,"I have been taking the medication like a good little patient, but still felt that my symptoms were derived more from my environment than my psychological wiring until today."
8927,Even back before my diagnosis and medication I found mornings tough- the quiet and the alone just make my brain want to turn off.
8928,"On medication, going to counseling, back in school."
8929,On medication.
8930,Lose my job so I am no longer on medication.
8931,Can't afford so you don't have medication.
8932,I get on my medication and them I'm sitting here and there is a clear moment where I can remember my whole life and what I did.
8933,Has anyone else experienced this problem since being put on meds or being diagnosed?
8934,"He takes medication for his depression, but it doesn't stop these monthly slip-ups."
8935,"I'm on meds, but you know, they work sometimes and sometimes they don't."
8936,No combination of meds is going to make me feel wonderful all the time.
8937,At the moment I'm not on any medication but have a psychiatrist appointment a week from Monday to get that changed.
8938,"I can cope relatively (pfffttt) well with my symptoms which are somewhat constant, but before Christmas they took a turn toward the manic side which resulted in a change in medication."
8939,I am apprehensive about medication turning me into something that I can't handle.
8940,"My parents don't believe in medication for mental illness, so I can't ask their help."
8941,"Obviously my first step is to see a professional, but has anyone managed their bipolar without medication?"
8942,"Even after the pregnancy with them and between my last pregnancy, I avoided medication and at this point I can't really even give a reason as to why I did."
8943,I ran out of meds and am back on day 3 after being out for about a week.
8944,It's been really hard to control it being off my medication &amp; dealing with withdrawals.
8945,"I want meds, but it looks like I will be waiting 3 or 4 months before I can get a prescription."
8946,"He was diagnosed 7 years ago, in his mid-20s, and been taking meds (lithium, abilify, and recently: adivan)."
8947,"I've always known that he sees a shrink and took meds, but I didn't know it was for bipolar."
8948,"**

But now that he's not drinking anymore, and taking **more** meds, it's like he's such a *different person*."
8949,"**When he's taking meds, and I they affect our relationship, is it nosey or selfish for me to tell him how I feel about them?"
8950,"Or, is the fact that the meds are helping him, enough of a reason for him to keep taking it, regardless of how it makes things between us."
8951,"I now know that's because of either the meds or the bipolar, so I can't it personally."
8952,Has anyone had a similar reaction to this medication?
8953,"I'll be seeing my doctor on Tuesday to let her know how I'm feeling, and discussing alternative medications."
8954,"I'm not sure what to do to help, she doesn't want to get back on meds or see a Dr. /ramble"
8955,"I was already struggling with depression when I went in and she decided to change my meds, I've told her I had suicidal thoughts in the past, and every medication I've been on so far has given me MASSIVE side effects."
8956,I'm just sensitive to medications.
8957,"The past two years have been a huge journey of acceptance, proper medication, recovery, and stability and then POOF, this wonderful dream girl shows up in my life!"
8958,"I had no say in what he prescribed me, until my excuse became ""No, sorry, I cannot afford this $600 a month medication!"""
8959,"I have never been medicated before him, even though I have been prescribed mental meds in the past for 'bipolar tendencies'."
8960,I got to a point that I realized and researched enough to know that I needed medication and that's all that could help me get through life.
8961,"How do I approach a doctor, not being ignorant to my issues and the medications I know are available to me that would help, and him take me seriously?"
8962,"**

They have since decided that I must absolutely have 90 day prescriptions or they will not cover my medication costs."
8963,"The problem is that my pdoc wants to switch me to lithium, and we can't exactly do a quick ramp down over 3 months of meds at a freaking time."
8964,"In short, Aetna is holding me hostage in a medication so that they can have more money."
8965,"Sometimes I smoke pot, drink, stay up late, and take my medication."
8966,"**NONCOMPLIANCE**

Noncompliance is incredibly high for bipolar medication or behavioral health."
8967,"This is because the medication is worse than the symptoms, when taken perfectly according to schedule."
8968,The meds turn us into someone we're not and our behavior is restricted even outside the hospital.
8969,Maybe we stop taking our meds because we don't want to be walking zombies.
8970,"No meds, but I want to get on them."
8971,"However, when I brought this up to my mother, she flipped her shit, and went on a rant, telling just about everyone about the meds they gave me and how they don't prove anything and how I can't be bipolar."
8972,She mentioned her medication stopped working.
8973,I've considered lying about it just so I could access antipsychotics/anxiety meds while I wait for my appointment with a treatment team.
8974,My advice is to get meds and stay on them.
8975,So far after 4 years I am finally starting to find the right meds.
8976,"My medication was useless, and I drank for three years."
8977,So does anyone have anything to report regarding 1) later-life hormonal shifts as they affect the need for medication and/or 2)  intellectual capacity returning with a cessation of Lamictal?
8978,"My doc has been pretty useless so far with advice about the time change and when to take medication, or anything Bipolar-Travel related."
8979,Stupid doctors should had checked into my mental state more before they gave me meds.
8980,I've seen a second Psychiatrist who agreed with the initial diagnosis and prescribed me medication.
8981,"This is my first set of medications to see if they work:

Depakote 500mg ER 2x day
Pristiq 50mg ER AM
Klonopin 1mg 3x day
Trazodone 50mg as needed for sleep

I'm still reeling from everything."
8982,"The Psychiatrist is the one who deals with diagnosis, further treatment options and medications, the nurse is more of a ""therapist"" or ""social helper"", just wanted to explain this is how things are over here in case of confusion."
8983,"As I now know, Bipolar is a lifelong condition and for him to say this to me has really scared me, if I need medication for many many years to come, which seems likely, then how can I be written off their books?"
8984,"Only Psychiatrists can deal with these medications, general doctors just aren't qualified to deal with this."
8985,"Doc says drinking coffee shouldn't be bad with the medication I'm taking, but I've noticed that it sometimes makes me feel very anxious and unbalanced."
8986,"), I've found myself stalling taking my medication, getting some withdrawal symptoms and headaches, and having a small burst of creativity where I can paint or play around with an instrument."
8987,"I don't think I was asking any questions, I just wanted to type this up before I took my medicine, heh."
8988,I've been on and off meds for a long time.
8989,"I followed with many different kinds of meds, tegretol, topomax, Seroquel, depaokote, the list goes on...."
8990,It seems like the meds just aren't helping with this.
8991,"My current doctor won't let me switch back to my old medications (topomax, seroquel and valium) and instead im on a cocktail of lamictal, geodon, risperdal, lexapro and klonopin."
8992,I really feel like five medications is too many.
8993,I recently moved and have been on the same medication for a while but I was running low and needed a refill.
8994,Can someone tell me about why episodes can happen when on medication?
8995,I'm aware that they can just happen but does the medication lower the duration of an episode?
8996,"I'm reconsidering the idea of going back on meds, but I would rather be struggling and lucid than vacuously alive and happy."
8997,What are your experiences with choosing to abstain from or with taking certain medications?
8998,I want to start taking my medication at night instead of in the mornings.
8999,"and after all the shit i've been through with hospitilizations, medication withdrawls, job after job lost because of me, i feel like a true loser."
9000,I saw her today for the first time since August to start medications again.
9001,"My symptoms aren't horrible right now, but the point was to start medication before they got worse."
9002,He stayed on meds for only a couple months.
9003,"If I want a diagnosis or medication suggestions, I will go to my GP."
9004,"I've attained a great deal of stability through education, self-management, and medication."
9005,- I am pro-medication.
9006,"Yes, psych medication can be a scary thing."
9007,"For some reason, there seems to be this collective amnesia about where medications came from in the first place."
9008,"(Really high self confidence, crazy amounts of goals, ideas, energy) [Like last week, I wrote a 9 page essay on the development of consciousness and the ego for the heck of it] I just saw a psychiatrist and why are trying to rule out if it is medications I take (SSRIs) or anything else that is causing it."
9009,I am totally not advocating drug use or self medication I'm just wondering what some peoples outcomes were both positive and negative.
9010,"Anyway, I've been hypomanic for about 4 days now, and have not been able to sleep, even with meds."
9011,He followed me and proceeded to lecture me about my sleeping meds and various things I should be doing to get to sleep.
9012,"Obviously I need help, that's why I take meds &amp; see the doctor regularly, etc.!"
9013,"My psych said the diagnosis isn't 100% until the medicine works, then we'll know it's a definite diagnosis."
9014,But on the other hand if I wait then I risk getting too emotionally attached just to find out the person is severely antimedication or is just an ass about mental health in general.
9015,It's been almost 6 months since I've been on any meds and while I'm definitely in what seems to be a 'depressive state' I have really begun to try to make myself feel better.
9016,Even debating trying meds again to help me out of this funk.
9017,"I don't feel like that's the right medication for me - my symptoms are almost all manic, and latuda is mainly for treating depressive episodes."
9018,"I feel like she cares more about ""selling"" the right medication instead of what's best for me."
9019,"Between work being horrible, and the stresses of school, and not even knowing what medication to suggest to my psychiatrist, I'm at a loss."
9020,"* It's OK to encourage, and even expect me to take my medication."
9021,* What my medication can do is important to our peace of mind.
9022,Having a bit of a situation and trying to get back on my meds.
9023,"I am turning 20 in august and have had to move back into my parents house, have no car and am trying to even out my medications."
9024,"** So far I have not had an episode, but there's been times where I would have two episodes a month, and then there's been times where I can go a month or two without 1 at all (this being before I started medication)."
9025,"* I do feel the medicine is working, though, there have been maybe 2-3 instances where I was in a very intense situation that would have normally either caused me to have an episode, or I would have burst out in anger/depression, and instead I was able to (I know this sounds crazy) actually use reason, breathe, and figure out what to do."
9026,Being bipolar II has little to offer the individual in terms of incentive to stay off medication.
9027,"I wanted to also say, that although I was extremely leery of the idea of taking meds forever, not to mention highly skeptical (of the efficacy of the meds, of the diagnosis itself), I have to say I'm glad I stuck with it."
9028,He's decided meds almost drove him to suicide.
9029,"(For those who read my last post, I start medication tomorrow, I'm enrolled in mental health services, and following through with my tests."
9030,I thought I could just remember whether or not I took my medication.
9031,I think I even had an episode due to inconsistency with the meds.
9032,Just being able to have the confidence of glancing at it and knowing I took my meds takes a HUGE weight off my shoulders every day before I leave the house.
9033,"I might have to go off my meds for a couple of months soon because of lack of insurance, but I think I'll do just fine."
9034,Does anyone else feel like they're taking meds for no reason?
9035,What medications made the difference for you guys?
9036,"This year I stopped taking my meds around february, and I feel awesome."
9037,"I study math and before, when I was on the meds, I felt stupid, like I couldn't do math anymore."
9038,"I'm supposedly bi-polar but I don't my medication and I feel totally fine, with no crazy mood swings."
9039,"On another note, I missed a dose of meds and didn't get much sleep last night and now I'm hypomanic as shit."
9040,"The idea being that it interacts with my medication, and also hypothetically interferes with my schoolwork."
9041,"It's not interfering with school, I'm not going manic, I'm taking my meds... why should I have to stop drinking with my friends?"
9042,"He asked me a bunch of questions and prescribed me Depakote, I've been doing lots of research on this medication just so I know what I'm getting into."
9043,"For the same reason that I'm scared to find all of this out, which is that my entire family is completely a part of the social stigma that people don't need medication, that it's for the weak, that anybody can control their mind through willpower alone... etc."
9044,"She is a large part of the reason I have been terrified of even considering medication, even attending therapy was seen as a major sign of weakness, she is organic everything, thinks everything can be solved with prayer, etc, but this year I decided once and for all to get help no matter what form that took."
9045,"Although I want to get better, after reading about this medication I am very scared of the side effects."
9046,"I have been very sensitive to psychiatric medication in the past and have a tendency to get the rarer side effects while skipping the ""common"" ones."
9047,I got some meds switched around yesterday and that ended up with me getting Ziprasidone added into my already confusing mix.
9048,I'm really scared because I've tried some anti-psychotic meds before (Seroquel and one other that I can't remember) and they made me gain about 80 pounds which I still haven't lost.
9049,I wish I could be completely off meds and waking up with no worries at all.
9050,I'm currently not on medication and it will take a while to get back to a psychiatrist for me.
9051,I never went to school for medicine 10+ years.
9052,my way isn't experienced enough in medicine.
9053,She does not take her medication for this condition.
9054,I was diagnosed with depression in 2006 and since then never really found the right medication.
9055,"In December 2011 I suddenly stopped taking my medication, which triggered a manic episode."
9056,"But it makes me wonder whether you can have a manic episode such as this without actually being bipolar, simply because you quickly stopped taking medication."
9057,"I have been 100% since then, and that could be due to the medication I'm on now, but there is a tiny piece of me wondering if I'd be ok without my medication because I wouldn't do anything to trigger another episode."
9058,"Don't worry, I'm not going to stop taking medication without the approval of my doctor, it's just something I think about."
9059,"If he's suicidal, he will blatantly attempt to overdose on his medication, and he'll sit in the living room in his underwear and cut himself."
9060,"The medications made me worse, it seems."
9061,Maybe take my meds first.
9062,"As someone put it on a thread of mine a while ago:

&gt;For me, being stable means I'm on medication, and I can go to do the day-to-day activities that most people have no trouble doing."
9063,"TL;DR - since being on meds, I haven't really felt emotionally present."
9064,"I read through the meds master list before my appointment yesterday and made a short list of what I'd be willing to try, and eager to avoid."
9065,* The right medication is like a good song on the radio.
9066,"The doc says that the medications go more towards prevention, not relief of current symptoms, and I've been severely depressed since early October."
9067,I've been on and off medications for anxiety and depression for 15 years.
9068,"My doctors tell me it's all in my head and that meds don't just ""stop working"" and to keep taking them and come back in a month."
9069,"My medication isn't working, I'm not able to get in to see my Doc until March."
9070,I'm a full time student and the meds not working is deeply affecting my attention span.
9071,"I was just wondering has anyone been told by a doctor or psychiatrist that in addition to the medicine they currently take, they should take any type of vitamins/supplements?"
9072,"Like I asked, has anyone else been told to try things like this in addition to their regular medicine?"
9073,Mind you these two friends know that I'm bi polar and that I have issues with moods even through my medication.
9074,"My psychiatrist is thinking of changing all of my medicines, which I really don't want to since my body is already adjusted to the medicines I am on."
9075,Will we get a proper balance of medication and kill her sex drive off?
9076,"She abuses medication and now since she is off medication, she has started drinking again."
9077,"She has had many doctors and has been on many, many medications."
9078,I'm afraid to take meds because I hear people lose themselves.
9079,I'm in college to be a neuropsychologist and I'm worried if I take medication or go to therapy that I won't achieve my dreams.
9080,She is from the school of thought that it may have been medication induced and there for different from non-medication induced.
9081,However I had been on the same dose of meds for years when the symptoms appeared.
9082,The psychologist said it was depression and sent me to a psychiatrist for medication.
9083,I weened off the medication and stopped talking to the doctors.
9084,Now I was extremely terrified of taking medication.
9085,"From here, I went a good while without trying any meds."
9086,"I stuck to the medication for a bit, but I was very unstable."
9087,"I weened off medication again, but I held on to my xanax because my anxiety had now gotten to the point where I would have panic attacks and it was the only thing that would help... even though it would usually put me to sleep."
9088,"By the time I went to follow-ups, they were telling me medication was imperative and that it's a matter of time before I self destruct."
9089,"It sounds like this is going to be tricky on their part due to the contraindications in some of the more popular meds (Adderall conflicts with bipolar etc)

Has anyone here been diagnosed with overlapping issues?"
9090,Thoughts on meds for someone so young?
9091,I'm going to try to see if there is a medication that treats both ADHD and bipolar because I'm beginning to feel agitated.
9092,"Don't get me wrong it helps me get stuff done and is a non harmful way to motivate myself, it just messes up my observations for medication."
9093,I have been stable with my meds for about 4 years now.
9094,"I'm now trying to fit meds into my life of eating right (most of the time), exercise, and getting rest at night."
9095,Can I get help without taking medicine?
9096,"I came out with a BP1 diagnosis, a medication regime and my pride shattered."
9097,"I have the help of the medication, a stress free life living  at mum's, a cat that loves me."
9098,I have to wait until monday to get my meds.
9099,I picked up some pharmaceuticals so I can actually sleep tonight and get my meds first thing in the morning.
9100,"About 4 years on current meds (a complex combination), overall I'd say I'm doing pretty good but the bad days.. the bad days."
9101,I've been through 25 unsuccessful and extremely awful medication changes and I don't think I've got another one in me.
9102,"I think this is as good as it gets, medication-wise."
9103,Substance use also interferes with sleep and may cause dangerous interactions with your medications.
9104,- Be cautious when taking any medication.
9105,Certain prescription and over-the-counter medications can be problematic for people with bipolar disorder.
9106,"Other drugs that can cause mania include over-the-counter cold medicine, appetite suppressants, caffeine, corticosteroids, and thyroid medication."
9107,"I wasn't entirely sure it was the medication, but it does seem I've been eating a ton more."
9108,(I just started taking the meds a few weeks ago.)
9109,"Hey all,

You might remember my post a month or so ago, complaining about the various side effects of coming on and off medication... well, I had a good, long heart-to-heart with my doctor, and we decided to change our approach, pharmaceutically speaking."
9110,"Time for my meds...


*gulp*


Wish me luck..."
9111,"After months of tapering down off her lithium, 2 weeks ago was the first time she's been totally off her medication in many years."
9112,"*

TL;DR  What can I say to someone, who is off their medication, going through a swing that'll help them open up and let them vent?"
9113,"I also have ADHD and thought I didn't need my medicine and once my mania ended and I remembered that I do need my medicine, I was  too embarrassed to ask for a refill."
9114,Any one else have experience on this medication?
9115,Next come the chaos of finding the right meds and dosage again.
9116,Back to the psychiatrist tomorrow.. maybe they'll find the right meds for me.
9117,"I've tried about a half dozen different meds by now, and the next one my doc wants to try is depakote."
9118,Basically I haven't gone psychotic for two years ever since I got on meds that calm my mania down not eliminate it.
9119,"She always spouts the classic ""it's all in your head, man"" and ""you don't need those medications, they're just big pharma messing with you"" and ""you just need to snap out of it, stop being a cop-out""... you all know the script."
9120,He is a long term user of anti psychotic drugs and though his psychiatrist has recently changed his medication to hopefully mitigate this he knows that the nerve damage may well be permanent.
9121,"And I still get depressed sometimes, my meds don't do shit for the depression."
9122,Everytime I come off my meds I see how much autonomy I'm giving up.
9123,I'm not promoting going off your meds unsupervised.
9124,I've been diagnosed for 4 years now and been on meds and for the most part feel normal.
9125,"Even though thinks went from bad to worse, I wanted to share that yes, I'm back on meds until this episode is gone and my doctor and therapist agree it's safe to go off them again (or will be soon, I haven't decided about the seroquel yet) and that I really appreciate this sub."
9126,"I've always taken my meds as prescribed,  except the night of my last suicide attempt (over two years ago)... but last night I took my nightly handful of pills and was getting my morning and mid-day doses ready for today, and I just started sobbing."
9127,"A year ago, I was trialed on a few psych meds for a crisis/manic episode."
9128,"The crisis got under control BUT after a certain combination of meds (lithium and doxepin), my emotions **completely flat-lined**."
9129,I feel good about the medicine and supplements I take and I feel confident I can finally maintain this.
9130,"when i was on bad meds, and when i was at my worst i ruined like 4 relationships, then last year was added to that, so 5 total, and i feel like i am kind of a loser and i suck."
9131,I'm on meds.
9132,"I've tried various combinations of over a dozen SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers, and anti-anxiety meds."
9133,I was just prescribed ziprasidone for bipolar disorder and was wondering if any of you have had experience with the medication that you could share.
9134,"However, I'm not sure if this change is mood is due to my normal bi-weekly mood swings or if the medicine is starting to work."
9135,Since my moods change so fast I have a really hard time determining the effectiveness of medication.
9136,I am seeing my psychiatrist on Tuesday and plan to tell her I need to come off the medicine.
9137,"pretty much everyone i know knows (because of my own actions), and they probably think i'm some kind of unstable freak or something


i recently stopped taking the meds i was prescribed, which was only 5mg abilify anyway."
9138,I agreed and we maintained monthly appointments to monitor my condition and at my May appointment she concluded that I may not need meds after all.
9139,She stated that she felt I do actually have BPD because therapy helped me SO SO SO much and the meds seemed to make no difference.
9140,I've asked for a referral back to a psychiatrist to see if I can try a different medication that maybe doesn't pack on the beef as much.
9141,Has anyone else had a similar experience and can recommend some medicines that I could discuss with my doctor?
9142,"tldr: Zyprexa makes me fatty fatty boom boom, alternative meds you can recommend?"
9143,I'm reading up on other meds and they're all so risky and the side effects are terrible no matter what.
9144,"I have tried many meds over 15 years, and nothing has seemed to help on the low end."
9145,"This works, unless it gets out of control too fast and I stop believing I need medication, or that I'm bipolar at all."
9146,Now to the reason I want to come off my meds.
9147,I just went on vacation to my friends cabin this past weekend and I had such a good time I felt like myself for the first time since I've been taking my medication.
9148,"So, my question for you is do you think now that I'm sober that I can come off my medication and just feel like I used to throughout my youth, without having any serious manic episodes that require hospitalization."
9149,My doctor changed the dose of my medication and I was just starting to get better but then I started to get hit with stress and anxiety.
9150,"If there are any ideas to help me out that don't involve putting me on more medication, they would be very much appreciated."
9151,"A few days earlier, a new psychologist had really changed up my medications (in what turned out to be a very good way)."
9152,I feel like throwing in the towel with my medications just so I can have mania just to feel good for a bit.
9153,"My therapist has casually thrown around that diagnosis after observing my long term cycles between perceived mania and depression, but never explicitly given me the diagnosis- nor have I been given/accepted any medication."
9154,"There were a multitude of thoughts that raced through my mind when this first happened, some of which included:

- My life is changing in so many known and unknown ways for the rest of my life

- No one will want to have sex with me ever again

- This really fucking hurts

- Oh, that's why I've been sick for the past week

- Just went to the bathroom, time to scrub the skin off of my hands out of a fear that I could spread it to another part of my body

After a doctor's visit, a trip to my therapist, starting medication, and a week to accept what had happened, I began to feel a little better."
9155,My meds have been working things have been great.
9156,I have been diagnosed with bipolar 3- irritable mania induced by antidepressants and medications.
9157,Ive been on soooooooo many meds and med changes.
9158,I have no idea if it was from anxiety or if it was coming off of the medication.
9159,I just don't know what to do with this medication.
9160,I feel like my meds are helping.
9161,"I felt, over the past few weeks, that my meds are working and now I just feel confused and angry."
9162,I feel my brain function has decreased a lot in the past few years and I wonder if this is a medication can help with that.
9163,"These ""episodes"" do get severe enough to be put on medication for a short period of time and then I am ""fine""."
9164,I've gone a week and half no mixing meds but I want to so bad....
9165,"I managed to sleep, and when I woke up, my grandma (who I live with) and I got into a small argument where she started blaming my irritability on the medicine, and saying she's going to take me off it."
9166,and then miraculously I feel better (without meds) but that lasts 2 weeks and then BOOM I feel awful again - it's like a reset button I have little to no control over.
9167,Are there any meds you'd recommend asking the doc about?
9168,"F, bipolar 2 here
No meds at the moment


So
I was wondering..."
9169,"I stopped taking my meds back in early October, just because the tremor in my hands from Abilify would not go away, even after a year and a half of treatment."
9170,I'll just feel like such a failure and think that I havent made any progress at all... That I need to go back to meds.. which I really don't want and refuse to do.
9171,I can't go back to meds.
9172,"I used to take my first dose of medication in the morning, 40mg Celexa and 200mg Lamictal at around 4 AM each day, but I would feel extremely lethargic at around 1 PM."
9173,So I decided that if i had to pay $160 a visit then I wanted to see a psychiatrist who could monitor me and my medication and knew what they were doing.
9174,It has been two weeks and this medicine is making me feel like shit.
9175,can i just stop with the meds and stop visiting him?
9176,I have medication to take TONIGHT!
9177,I have gained 8 lbs in one week and I probably lost some then gained some (I went a few days without medicine and I suddenly stopped eating during the days because I wasn't hungry.)
9178,I'm going to call my doc ASAP and talk about my meds because I don't think they've been working.
9179,Is this how these medications make you 'feel' to control the mania?
9180,They give him some meds to help him sleep.
9181,"He's against medication because when he was little he was put on some ADHD meds that made him suicidal and understandably, he didn't like that."
9182,But I heard a similar case where a very small dose of meds were given and helped life return to normal.
9183,In my teens I was prescribed a few medications that only made my symptoms worse or just completely numbed me into a walking zombie.
9184,"Quick question, is it possible for marijuana use and alcohol use fuck with medication or your mood in negative ways?"
9185,"when i want to start dating again, start a band, just have a life again, i have to be myself i dated once when i was loaded up on meds and i think i scared the girls cause i came across as an emotionless zombie."
9186,"this goes along with what my current psychiatrist, who used to be my old one before i switched to a private practice psychiatrist so i could see my therapist before the whole thing with my psychiatrist giving me the wrong fucking directions on getting off an antidepressant, ...sigh

he said ""i think your on too much medication"" i was like ""YES!"
9187,so...that's two meds i've got off of.
9188,the next step to being myself again is getting off this zombifying medication.
9189,Does anyone take vitamins along with their meds?
9190,"This may be stress of having Bipolar I,  Generalized Anxiety, meds or just life."
9191,I've been on medications solidly for the last 7 years.
9192,"Anyways, I think it may be something to do with my meds (lithium, lamictal, latuda)  I stopped taking my meds for about 2 months and it went away and I just started taking them again and suddenly it's back."
9193,"It's not couples therapy, just a meeting to explain the behavior of people with mood disorders and the effects of medication, etc."
9194,"What motivates you, I'm looking for a reason other than to take meds."
9195,I almost feel as if I need to just have a drink and my meds right beside me when I wake up because I don't have enough motivation to walk over to the bathroom to get them.
9196,I haven't been put on any medicine as of yet because I've been bounced around so many therapists that they haven't had the chance to do much.
9197,"The sentence I am referring to is in your second paragraph and reads as follows, **""They never take a day off, and they're constantly off their meds."
9198,"I believe the exact words Huckabee used were, **""[he] apparently needs medication for schizophrenia."
9199,So I tell him about what I've been feeling and he changed my meds a bit...and idk what I think of that.
9200,"Anyways this is what my meds are now:

Lamictal 200 (was at 100)
Lexapro 20 (same)
Xanex .5 twice a day (same)
Wellbutrin SR 150 twice a day (new)

I feel like that's a crap load I antidepressants."
9201,I was just perscribed medication after being unmedicated for nine years.. how long before you saw results?
9202,"“I can't tell my family.” “I don't want them to take away my kids.” “I don't want to take medication.” “I don't want it to affect my job.” “I don't want to be thrown in the looney bin!”

(In the U.S.) You cannot have your children taken away from you solely because you are mentally ill. You will not be forcibly incarcerated solely because you are mentally ill."
9203,"On the question of medication, no one is going to force you to take medication if you don't want to, except in extreme, emergency circumstances where a shot may be used."
9204,“Talking to a professional” does not mean you're taking meds.
9205,I have some caution when it comes to medication as I have previously had very bad experiences with SSRIs (but I am on benzos for anxiety with a lot of success).
9206,My therapist knows and is supportive of my wariness of meds.
9207,"She asked me if I'm totally against taking meds for bipolar and I said I definitely don't want to be on lithium but, I'd have to think about it as far as any others go."
9208,Please share your experiences with either or both medicines.
9209,"I just hate being bipolar sometimes especially when it gets paired with my pms and hormones and no meds, oh and being stressed about baby making."
9210,"The thyroid medicine has apparently started working, and I have received a ""normal thyroid test"" and ""normal iron and blood count."""
9211,"And it's not like I'm stupid, I was undiagnosed ADHD and got a 0.3 then after going on medication got a 3.83 over two semesters and since I started developing bipolar systems and got diagnosed I've had a 1.94 and god knows what this semester will be."
9212,...4 weeks into it...stick to the meds.
9213,"When going through depression my meds are 45mg Nardil, 400mg Lamictal."
9214,"* I take my medication daily

* I sought out help

* I decided that I am moving across the country...because I want to, and I will not let someone else's wants persuade me differently."
9215,"Either way, it doesn't seem to matter because I am on meds, and they mostly help."
9216,"But I'm afraid to be on meds again, I still have side effects from the ones I was on, I don't trust my body to take medication well."
9217,"I don't know what I'm really asking, but I just need to sleep so badly but not have the problems meds have caused."
9218,"Anyone else have this issue in general, with any meds?"
9219,"I think about it every day, I wish I wouldn't, but like I said, the last 4 months (3 of which I've been on meds) have really taken my good spiritedness and turned it into an anxiety-ridden agoraphobic racist mooching taker."
9220,"After I stopped taking medications I felt more ""normal."""
9221,Didn't have to feel shame for taking medications because I was diagnosed with Bipolar-I.
9222,I have a question about meds and the flu.
9223,"Now, if I empty my stomach everywhere, do I take my meds again?"
9224,"Last night, I forgot to take my medication, and so I got at most four hours of sleep."
9225,"I fear that I might start seeing things like the other night I was late on my meds, when I thought that lightning was flowing into my palms and giving me a godlike power, and the sky looked like a rich purple and blue, pulsating."
9226,It was like a dream...I did not know it wasn't real until I woke up from it (when I took my medication).
9227,"It got better once I interacted with people, and I quickly went back to my dorm room to take my medication."
9228,So it is not any medication i am taking.
9229,"Previous post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/t63gc/im_sick_of_taking_my_medication/)

I was discharged about a week ago and am generally feeling more stable."
9230,"My medicines were switched, I stopped the Prozac, started Zoloft, and am on a higher dose of the Lamictal."
9231,We are still observing how my meds work and there is a possibility that they will change soon.
9232,"For those who have tried different mood stabilizers, how would you describe the differences in your medication?"
9233,"My parents have to live with me for financial reasons but unfortunately my father stopped taking medication for years due to his beliefs as a Christian (specifically, he believes God has ""healed"" him."
9234,So I'm a rapid cycler and tend to still have (mostly) minor episodes while on my meds.
9235,I was on a low dose of lithium for the first half of the year or so but I stopped taking my meds.
9236,"If I'm on meds, then I feel I'm just your average run-of-the-mill person."
9237,"Sure I suffer, I am right now, but who am I truly and how does medication take away from that?"
9238,"My parents are supportive these days, but my moms first answer to everything is ""medication."""
9239,"&gt;I went to another doctor today on the same hospital, trying to question the diagnosis and medication."
9240,He barely looked at my previous chart and said that the other doctor was right and the medication isn't having any affect yet.
9241,"I know this won't last and I'll need medication in the future, but apparently what I'm passing through now is a manic episode in the doctor's eyes."
9242,"Clearly manic, here your meds."
9243,"If you took the medication anyway, how do you think did this affected you?"
9244,I'm really scared to start taking medication for bipolar disorder and fuck up my depression more.
9245,"I've been off medication for a year, my last depressive episode was four months ago, and it was pretty mild and short (about three weeks)."
9246,I have finally gone back to the course that I really want to do and after some trouble with medication I have had to drop down to only studying one subject this semester.
9247,"Even if I have taken my medications for the day and am having a great day, if I lose something it instantly consumes my attention and emotional energy until I track it down, or give up and spend the rest of the day depressed."
9248,I am willing to try any medication because I'm so tired of this.
9249,"Quick Bio: So I'm not on meds, I'm BPII, and I didn't like the way they made me feel."
9250,Taking deep breaths and one moment at a time until either the rise stops or I admit it's gone too far up and throw in that meds towel (currently off meds with close monitoring by my psychiatrist).
9251,Edited to add: anyone have experience with these meds?
9252,"This started a period of 10 years searching for relief from traditional medicine, only to find out that the cure was too often worse than the illness."
9253,Psychiatric drugs tend to treat the symptoms other people want suppressed while leaving the patient suffering from both the emotional load of the disorder and side-effects of medication that are often worse than the underlying illness.
9254,"I know, take every experience with a grain of salt because we all react a little differently to medications."
9255,I lost my meds during a camping trip 2 weeks ago and my psychiatrist took forever to refill my perscription.
9256,"I finally got my meds today, but I feel like crap."
9257,"I know it's because I haven't taken my meds, but that doesn't make me feel any better."
9258,TL;DR: Lost my meds and I feel like shit
9259,"I know it's heavily discouraged to share prescription medication, but would there be any harm with having him take 25mg?"
9260,"He's already asking for alcohol, and of course we said no and removed it all booze from the house, so I doubt he would be resistant to taking prescription medication."
9261,This is the only reason I don't want to be on my medication.
9262,I'm on a lot of other medication and she doesn't want to drop any of them so I'm also worried about just continuing to add more.
9263,"To preface, I take medication, I meditate, and I see a therapist."
9264,"I'm doing the best that I can, trying to help out around the house, cooking healthy meals, exercising, getting regular sleep, taking medications, not drinking doing drugs etc."
9265,"All of this is very important, self, because the meds can do just so much."
9266,The psychiatrist hasn't given me any medication yet.
9267,I ran out of meds and went without them for a week and now that I'm back on them I feel so fabulous.
9268,Am I doing harm to my brain by not being on meds or not?
9269,"After a few weeks of trying ""coping mechanisms"" alone, my therapist referred me to someone else for an evaluation for prescription medications."
9270,"I know that everybody is different and medications affect them in different ways, but I could just use some reassurance that this is going to be worth it."
9271,"It was a choice between eating to live &amp; meds to survive, or co-pay."
9272,"I'm lucky enough to have at least one more refill for all my meds, but after that?"
9273,My meds clearly aren't working and I'm losing my insurance at the end of the month and don't know what to do.
9274,"I'm definitely amenable to the idea of doing whatever I can to improve my situation, but I have never really taken a prescription medication in my life other than antibiotics."
9275,"I've been off of my meds for a while now, I know i shouldn't have stopped, but the more depressed I got the less of a point I saw in taking the meds."
9276,* **History**: was diagnosed twelve years ago and have been on various medications over the years as well as cycled off of all medication for some years.
9277,I was wondering if any of you have it with your bipolar disorder and if you do do you take any meds for it?
9278,How are the meds?
9279,"She takes her meds regularly, takes good care of herself - the entire time I never saw anything I would identify as bipolar."
9280,It seems like the best way to fix things is a medication adjustment.
9281,I am not citing the medication because side effects are very personal.
9282,"So Mary goes in for her second appointment with the psych, asks her if she should be changing meds and what she is supposed to do if she escalates again."
9283,She got the meds and dosage right first try and they were never unwell again to her knowledge.
9284,Finding wellness and stability with a medication does not mean the war is over; it just means the theater of battle is over.
9285,But that's also assuming that the person finds the right medication on the first try.
9286,"Fuck, I'm on my 40-somethingish combination of meds."
9287,"Like recommended supplements, not to replace meds, but for improving things like sleep, lack of energy or ways to slow down, articles, books, gadgets, etc?"
9288,It seems like I was finally seeing some good results from meds but now I am in a tailspin.
9289,She doesn't want meds and doesn't want to go to therapy.
9290,we feel good and stop the meds because we think we don't need them and then we're talking suicide and self harm and all kinds of nastiness.
9291,But I haven't taken my meds in weeks due to chronic nausea from before i had my gallbladder out last week... and i feel fine.
9292,Update: ok.. y'all convinced me to take my meds last night for the first time in a couple months.
9293,Outs obvious that the chronic nausea was a combination of gallbladder and meds.
9294,So scared though because these meds have been the ONLY ones that have worked for me...
9295,"Basically, what I'm asking is should I change meds?"
9296,"I've spoken to my support worker and I'm set to go on lithium but can't see the consultant until next week so I think I'm stuck with risperidone until then, as he's the only one who can change my meds.Is there anything I can try naturally to aid with the hypomania?"
9297,"I was diagnosed as bipolar when I was only 12, and as I've gotten older the symptoms have only gotten worse (now I'm 24) When I was first in the psychiatric hospital after an attempted suicide at 18 years old, I finally began taking bipolar medication but hated the side effects."
9298,I eventually just quit everything and now I find myself constantly lying to my current psychiatrist because I don't want to be placed back on bipolar medications.
9299,Is there any good stores or medication combinations that anyone feels helped them more ultimately?
9300,So i stopped taking the medication for my neck and another problem i have with my brain an the migraines it causes.
9301,Because it feels wrong to take medicine to be...stable.
9302,Before the meds I concealed the depression through a mildly cocky attitude and a dry wit.
9303,I definitely have issues with sleeping and go hypo/depressive when I dont' sleep on a medication.
9304,"I have bad adhd, have been on depression meds since age 14, have dealt with ocd, panic attacks, and social anxiety."
9305,"I will talk to my psychiatrist and doctors about this, and also never eat right before going to sleep to see if that helps ... however, I'm wondering if it could be medication related."
9306,"A lot of the descriptions online are really loopy ""medication as a last resort focus on spiritual healing"" people."
9307,Now it took me 10 years to get on the right meds and someone can take them out of my cold dead hands.
9308,"I'm on a large mix of medication, I don't have a steady regular doctor, and my meds make it so I can't take a buch of other meds (steroids, pain killers etc."
9309,Other than that she is on meds and is seeing a therapist.
9310,"My condition is treated with medicine, but if I do not sleep well and am quite stressed, then my symptoms can surface."
9311,"While I've read the rationalization that if bipolars are taking their meds, then they aren't really responsible for their actions."
9312,"Here's the different antidepressant medications I have tried, most at different milligram dosages."
9313,"I got furious, because I knew that once again, another medication I was on was making me cycle and I wasn't feeling happy."
9314,"I'm only 21 years old yet every one of those medicines I have tried (at many different doses, mind you) never worked for me."
9315,"As weird as it sounds, my medicine made my disability far worse than my condition ever has treated me...lithium is the only thing that hasn't fucked me over somehow.."
9316,Call the doctor he finally calls in some medicine.
9317,Shes been seeing a therapist and on meds now.
9318,"However, I've been off the meds and haven't seen a doctor in a little less than a year and a half."
9319,I made an appointment with a new doctor at the end of the month and wanted to know what I can do to get back on the medicine.
9320,I don't want the doc to only think I'm there for the meds.
9321,"She is not making nearly enough to pay for her meds and her mortgage, and needs to find a new job with health benefits being a priority."
9322,"Moreover, the meds she takes make her very out of it in the morning, and so she looks and talks like she is drunk or high for a few hours after waking up."
9323,"She doesn't want to change her meds though, being as this is the first time she has been stable in a very long time."
9324,I don't want to take meds anymore.
9325,These meds are all placebo effect.
9326,Before I started the medicine I didn't have as nearly extreme side effects as I've experienced while on it.
9327,"This is all making me question whether, or not I should stay on the medicine."
9328,"I know that if I stop taking the medicine my moods won't be as level, but I'll start feeling like my old self and I'll have a piece of my humanity back."
9329,"Look, I'm on medication for this."
9330,4 Years ago a psycho bipolar bitch murdered my sister because she was laid off and didn't have access to meds.
9331,"I started taking meds again, lamictal, during the two weeks of depression, but shouldn't my mania have lasted longer?"
9332,"So I'm starting school again after a semester and summer off to fix my meds and just get my act together (I was failing all of my classes, barely sleeping, etc.)."
9333,"I now have meds that work, have evened out my sleeping schedule and have even been promoted to supervisor at my job."
9334,"When you are taking daily doses of bipolar medication (in my case 200mg of Lamotrigine + 50mg Seroquel), do not accidentally forget you've already taken it and double the dose (400mg and 100mg for me)."
9335,"So be **extra** careful with your medication people, that stuff needs warning labels in flashing neon."
9336,"Finally get meds adjusted, and there's some variation over the years, but not much changes until last year when I tell my shrink I've been getting bouts of euphoria."
9337,"She stopped taking the medication, which I read Is common with bipolar, they think that they are ok, and stop taking medication."
9338,"There's been lots of reckless behavior, such as quitting her job, binge drinking (and driving), and cheating on her boyfriend with some weirdo from twitter who is encouraging her to embrace her mania and bipolar and not take meds because pharmaceutical companies are evil."
9339,"She told that she's fairly certain I have bipolar disorder, but wants to hold off on making diagnosis and any medications until she is sure."
9340,I am changing medication (on the advice of my *doctor) an I am trippin like colours and stuff and weird dreams about scary lists.
9341,"Although I don't think my medicine in helping the way it should, I do honestly believe the diagnosis is correct - I am on ritalin, but adderall was way too much for me to handle."
9342,"Also I do take my meds and listen to my doctor about this stuff, it would just be nice to

 talk with you folks about them."
9343,I have been reluctant to take medication although maybe my reasoning may be flawed.
9344,I've been taking my meds but I still get this way occasionally.
9345,"I'm a 25-year-old woman (26 in a couple of weeks) and I've been dealing with bipolar 2 (but I have manic episodes with certain medications), binge eating disorder, and some bizarre menstruation related depression bulls**t since I was 17 or so (diagnosed then but dealt with it for about 6 years before that)."
9346,"My medications are a clusterf**k. I don't know if what's going on with me is the hypothyroidism, the bipolar disorder, or some menstruation related depressive disorder."
9347,"It sucks enough to need to calibrate psych meds, but now I'm calibrating synthroid and birth control pills with all of this while struggling with binge eating/weight issues."
9348,"I have a follow up with my psychiatrist tomorrow and I think if I wanted to try other meds he would switch, but I just wanted to hear other experiences with seroquel or other meds."
9349,"I've been in outpatient over a year and the first time since being diagnosed 6 years ago I've committed to taking my meds, seen my psychiatrist, therapist and attending group weekly."
9350,"Ive gone off and on meds over the years, and i get it - ive battled with them."
9351,"Going through the rituals of 600 mg of Sequel a day, not to mention the Zoloft and other meds I'm on, it wears a guy down."
9352,"It's important to remember, even when things are at their worst, and your meds make you feel like vomiting for days straight, when you're alternating between hypersomnia and insomnia, when people look at you funny when you're struggling with things that aren't really there, when you feel yourself slipping into depression, we all need to support each other."
9353,I had my first medication prescribed to me.
9354,"I have taken many medications, and they have each resulted in terrible side effects and many have had effects that last longer than a month."
9355,One thing I look for in medication is that my cognitive ability isn’t hindered.
9356,My fiancé asked me to stop taking the medication because he didn’t want to be with someone who was high all the time.
9357,Both he and I agreed that it would be best for me to stop taking this medication.
9358,"**Prozac**– Certainly the best of all the medication I took, except for two problems."
9359,"I realize that not all medication will give me terrible side effects, but I’m not eager to try anything else."
9360,"As it is, I’m as functioning as a bipolar can be without medication."
9361,I’ve been trying to look up some sort of way to deal with this without medication.
9362,"I’ve been told that this is an illness, and for every illness, you should take medication, but this is a part of me."
9363,"What are some ways you’ve found to cope with this without using medication, or is this a doomed pursuit from me?"
9364,i can't afford meds(already talked to my therapist).
9365,After a surgery last year my meds seemed to completely quit working.
9366,"Then I found a civilian dr who put me back on the same meds I was on before, unsuccesfully."
9367,"He agreed the old meds were not helping any more, and put me on lurasidone."
9368,"The meds did nothing to help it, and when I woudl cycle up all I coudl do was hide in my house until I calmed down."
9369,Is this the meds?
9370,Well I am out of meds.
9371,"So I am now 3 days without meds, looking at possibly another 5 days without."
9372,I was also not on meds for the whole of last year.
9373,"I still haven't met with my primary care doctor, so I don't know which meds I will be taking."
9374,"Besides getting too detailed, here is a list of medications/therapies he has already tried: 

* Depakote
* Sarafem 
* Zolof 
* Celexa 
* Effexor 
* Topamax 
* Abilify 
* Lithium 
* Seroquel 
* Geodone 
* Lamictal 
* Tegratol 
* Latuda 
* Propranolol 
* Also has had ECT and rTMS."
9375,I'm kind of freaked out by the idea of taking meds.
9376,Is your creativity still going strong while on medication?
9377,I absolutely cannot be off my meds.
9378,"As long as you take your bipolar medications faithfully, you should be in no fear of suicidal thoughts or actions."
9379,"Hey I have lately been wondering if maybe I am in need of some more medication due my to many, and severe down swings."
9380,She got lowered to a small dosage (she's somewhat comfortable talking about meds and doc appointments) and then on her on volition decided to stop taking meds because she doesn't like they way they make her feel.
9381,"I know meds react differently in everyone, but has anyone else had bad experiences with mood stabilizers?"
9382,"I told my doctor and instead of switching meds, she kept increasing my doses."
9383,It got to the point where I knew the meds were doing more harm than good but I trusted my doc's opinion.
9384,Wondering if anyone has any advice on what medications to discuss when I get a new doctor.
9385,I am currently not on meds (don't crucify me) because my therapist taught me a lot of coping mechanisms for when I feel a depressive episode coming on and I feel better than I have ever felt while on meds (I have been on antidepressants and other psych meds since I was 16 and I'm now 22).
9386,I've been stable for a year; I just needed to switch meds so that's why we can go so slowly.
9387,"I was afraid of medication, so I stopped going to see him."
9388,"I've been through the medication rounds, hospital stays, and therapy."
9389,"I'm not on medicine, I was fine without it for a couple years, but I was in therapy."
9390,"She has been healthy, happy and stable for over 10 years with medication (which is altered every now and then of course) and has been through so much."
9391,**TL;DR:** Going off for a week was the longest I have been of my meds in four years.
9392,Also...How the hell am I supposed to afford another appointment and my meds?
9393,YMMV big time...everybody has a different reaction to meds.
9394,"I guess my point is, don't discount the affects that the right medications can have, and if you've been on your meds for a while and are not happy, think about changing meds, if not doctors."
9395,I wondered if anyone would share experiences living without meds.
9396,In particular travelling while not taking meds.
9397,Please note however I don't want to encourage people to stop taking their medication!
9398,"I was diagnosed with BP (no idea the type, been told 'mild' with 'early psychosis') about a year and a half ago, took the meds for about year, then was kind of taking them, then stopped altogether."
9399,"I have had mild episodes that pass, I became aware of them pretty quick and it all went away just as it would have on meds, even quicker."
9400,What strategies could I use apart from meds when overseas?
9401,"I am still working with my docs to get the medication right, and I want to apologize before I slip."
9402,I'm not going to be able to find a family doctor and get an appointment before my medication runs out.
9403,"I don't want more help, I don't want more medication."
9404,"I *always* remember to take my meds, but last week was very stressful for me and I started to forget things."
9405,I was told go to the sliding scale clinic to get medication.
9406,"I sought help and it has been a fucking battle with doctors, meds, and family."
9407,Or should I look at going on another medication?
9408,I had been on ADHD meds long before I got back on lithium and zoloft.
9409,"So basically, I don't know if the combination of those types of meds don't mix well or what."
9410,Is anyone taking meds for their bipolar as well as medicine for ADHD?
9411,We have a 10 year old girl who had been diagnosed as ADHD but the diagnosis was reversed because of her reaction to the several medications they tried.
9412,Does anyone have children who have been prescribed this medication?
9413,I am a little worried that she is young for antipsychotic medication.
9414,For years i really thought i was just depressed but i started looking up my medications after my dr mentioned my family history with bipolar and started thinking about my past and the way i acted.
9415,"When the meds hit, the depression returns."
9416,"I need someone to tell me that if I don't smoke pot, take my meds, sleep well..."
9417,I'm just so tired of the self medication of  my horrendous scars of not holding a job for more than half a year..  For quitting college shut-off of time.
9418,I know it is a double edged sword but I don't want to do meds.
9419,Also the fact that the medicines have made my symptoms worse she said her oath is to do no harm.
9420,Was it helpful in getting the right meds?
9421,"Not too stoked about that visit, I've missed like 4 appointments in a row now, and haven't been on meds."
9422,"Don't take more of your medications, especially if you know they will mess with you."
9423,"I had a 2-3 month supply of medication, planned ahead for moving and settling in."
9424,"(i've been on cymbalta, lexapro, wellbutrin, paxil, adderall, benzos... i dont remember) I was just wondering when you knew...I know I have depression but I'm wondering if bipolar meds will help me more."
9425,"The VA tried putting me on several medications, each of which either had terrible side effects on me or flat out didn't work; I had an alergic reaction to Paxil, and passed out randomly, busting my face on Abilify."
9426,I stopped taking all medications and stopped going to my appointments with them.
9427,"I went to an in-patient center for a week where they gave me some meds and monitored me, then I was discharged and returned to the VA, although I was homeless once again."
9428,"For now, I am taking a handfull of medications... Buproprion (Wellbutrin), Buspirone (Buspar), and Rispdone (Risperal) at the moment, but I am still working with my doctor to adjust those, as I am more stable now than ever, but still could use improvment with things like anxiety and my possible (and untreated) ADHD."
9429,I'm mostly frustrated because this was all brought on by incorrect medicine.
9430,So I am med free and do not plan on using medication again ( not recommending this to any one as I think meds are needed for most people with BPD to remain safe ) because meds left me damaged and sick.
9431,"I can't see my Phyc dr about this as he will no doubt force medication on me as he has done in the past, but at the same time I feel my self getting to a bad situAtion where my frustration may be turned on my body or god forbid, some one I love."
9432,"My meds haven't changed, my diet hasn't changed, my life hasn't changed (besides getting engaged)."
9433,I have a friend who is professionally diagnosed and is supposed to be on medication.
9434,"However, I only recently witnessed him in a manic state that was, by his own admission, the worst he's had in a while; all because he stopped taking his medication for a month."
9435,"Even today when he's back to normal and he has assured me he took his meds because he was horrified by the episode, I'm still shaken and scared."
9436,Help me to not be scared and help me to impress upon him the consequences that the people around him face when he is not taking his medication without alienating him.
9437,"I'm on meds, I probably more stable than 80% of people I know."
9438,"So I've gone through a full cycle recently (manic/hypomanic in early May, depression second week of May through all of June and early July, started taking anxiety medication...which only really pulls me from ""suicidal"" to ""life sucks..."" So now I'm in a relatively normal state, but I drink all the time."
9439,"I haven't been on medication for anything in over 2 years, so im a little nervous but glad im finally doing this."
9440,it was a little embarrassing though when i asked her if i could get something to treat my anxiety... she went on a long rant about not wanting to give xanax to someone with a history of drug abuse when i was actually trying to say i wanted to know if there was a more daily type of anxiety medication i could take... ahaha.
9441,"My question is, could these be medicine side effects that are happening late in the game?"
9442,"Through these programs, ongoing therapy and medication - I can proudly say that I am now completely reality based and stable."
9443,I have asked my psychiatrist and 2 pharmacists if the cause would be my medication.
9444,The second pharmacist told me it would likely be caused by my medication.
9445,Do you believe the cause to be the medication?
9446,I have thought about ceasing taking my medication by gradually by tapering it off to see if it is the cause ( my doc is willing to do this with me if i choose it).
9447,Her meds ran out and she decided not to come back.
9448,During the three weeks I was not there she was off her meds.
9449,"Two days ago, she got her meds adjusted finally."
9450,I know it can take up to two weeks for the meds to kick in fully.
9451,I started a new medication just yesterday and I smelled popcorn in the microwave when it was lemon ginger tea heating up.
9452,It's funny because the increased dose of meds is supposed to combat this I guess but it's only gotten more intense like I can't slow down or stop or anything.
9453,Are there any alternatives to medicine that I could use to possibly slow down right now?
9454,"I was never offered medication, and in all honesty I'm not sure I would accept them if I were offered, so when I met a psychologist who said he didn't believe I needed meds, I of course jumped straight to his methods."
9455,Been a while since I've had an episode either way and I was taken off medication to see how I did.
9456,It's not even from any meds.
9457,"I posted on here because I hate doctors and meds and such, but I've been so turned around in my own head."
9458,"I convinced myself I had ADD/ADHD my freshman year of college, took Vyvanse for a year (the same 30 mg dose), and towards the end of the year I started having freak outs, and I looked it up and vyvanse can apparently trigger these disorders or worsen them, which is why I really dislike meds now."
9459,"Before my episode, I was at the high end of the normal BMI range, around 25 kg/m^2, but ever since I have gone on meds I have been overweight."
9460,"I have thought about joining Weight Watchers and stuff, but I don't really want to tell other people about me being bipolar or gaining weight because of meds."
9461,"The first year was difficult due to not having a clear diagnosis of what I had and finding the “correct” medications that worked for me (antipsychotics – risperidone, aripiprazole, haloperidol all caused significant side effects)."
9462,"So my question is, does anyone know what will happen if I just start taking it at bedtime with my other meds?"
9463,They think I'm going to go manic if I continue smoking but I keep telling them that because of the medication I'm on that it won't happen.
9464,Then they're telling me the psychiatrist said to stay away from weed because it interacts with the medications.
9465,"I've recently had a new girl move into my apartment, and she's told me briefly that she's bipolar and schizoaffective, but cannot take her medication because she's pregnant."
9466,I cycled through several meds of antidepressants and antipsychotics while finding an effective treatment for the PTSD.
9467,"Although I know the diagnosis itself doesn't change anything (I'm not any more bipolar just because a doctor diagnosed me with it), but I am really concerned about the side-effects of whatever meds they are about to put me on and how they will effect my ability to function."
9468,"I can't get in until June 2nd and my chart is closed at my previous clinic, so I have absolutely no way of getting my meds refilled and I'm scared shitless."
9469,"I thought this might be helpful since I've seen some questions come up in regards to ""the rash"" that can happen from meds like Lamictal."
9470,"The rash is fast growing, and even with stopping the medication you have to just let the reaction run it's course."
9471,"oh and if anyone is curious what I normally look like, with out the swelling and marks, LOL here's me [Normally..](http://i.imgur.com/0QhEp.jpg)


eta - I'm not posting this to scare anyone away from their medication, but to ease peoples worries about the rash."
9472,"SJS is very rare - about 6-7 in a million get SJS, and it can be caused by hundreds of different medications."
9473,"However, having said that, for some unknown reason certain medications - like lamictal - tend to have a higher rate of SJS/TENS than other medications."
9474,The only other medication that has a higher rate is sulfa based antibiotics like bactrim.
9475,"Not everyone who has a rash from medication like Lamictal will go on to getting SJS, but there are signs to look for so you can get treatment right away."
9476,"I applied for the free meds programs at Astra Zennica, and haven't heard anything back either."
9477,No medication.
9478,"Still haven't started meds, if any of you are wondering because insurance is a bit of a b****."
9479,"He's on lots of meds and sees his psychiatrist weekly, and is working on getting stable."
9480,"So I've been really controlled as far as managing my bipolar 1 for the last several years and while that level of hyper vigilant care (consistent sleeping, eating well, taking meds consistently, ministering my moods) isn't possible 100% of the time."
9481,"Im on medication right now, and have been for a couple of weeks."
9482,Edit: I'm not taking any kind of medications.
9483,"I don't have a doctor here yet, but I do need to go on meds soon."
9484,Any of you have weight issues while on meds?
9485,"My psychiatrist has prescribed the relevant medications, etc., but I just don't know what is real?"
9486,"I have the right meds, support system and people in my life to get by."
9487,"The meds were all prescribed by a primary care physician without much talk about my specific symptoms other than ""I feel depressed/anxious frequently."""
9488,I'm weary to try different meds because of the nightmare that is paxil withdrawal.
9489,Is it a good idea to keep trying new things and dragging myself through the mud with the wrong meds until I find the right one?
9490,Should I seek a psychiatrist to help with meds over my general physician?
9491,"Lately, I've been very stable, even without meds but again got dumped out of the blue."
9492,"She doesn't like taking meds (she's tried Wellbutrin, actually what I'm taking for mild depression) because she feels it makes her too flat and turns her into a different person."
9493,Maybe it takes awhile for the meds to settle in?
9494,I've had my boyfriend lock up all his guns (he works in private security) and have asked him to check with me each night when I take my meds to be sure I'm taking the right amount.
9495,Then I stopped that along with meds and went back into chaos.
9496,"I still haven't gotten back on meds, all I take is suboxone."
9497,Trying to smoke less and eventually completely stop so I can take meds without having my brain feel all fucked up.
9498,"I was diagnosed about 15 years ago, and we all know that medication can't fix everything."
9499,"When I say sober I just mean not drinking, she still binges on weed for days or weeks at a time with pauses in between, in an apparent self-medication attempt."
9500,"She is not on meds, I believe she tried them but being a student in a creative field, she didn’t like how they changed her."
9501,My concern has to do with the medication issue and general reality-grounsing.
9502,I have a feeling that if I describe what I'm feeling to my psych he'll strongly recommend putting me back on medicine.
9503,I feel like the medicine is currently numbing emotions I need to learn to deal with.
9504,"My greatest hesitations right now lie in the fact that I want to support her making positive choices, rather than be nagging her to take her meds on time and to not go out and be irresponsible...

Any tips from your experiences would be greatly appreciated!!!"
9505,"I'm not sure if this high, or not as the internet is inconclusive... :-) I have been on the meds for six weeks."
9506,"My most prominent symptom, for years, was an unending migraine that did not respond to any kind of pain medicine or therapy."
9507,* “You shouldn't take medication.
9508,I have yet to see a medication that has worst side effects than untreated Bipolar Disorder.
9509,I treat my psych medication like a loaded gun.
9510,At least with medication I have some idea of what MAY happen as opposed to an unwell cycle which could slam me out of nowhere.
9511,I'm starting on a new medication in a bit... Abilify.
9512,This is probably the 6th or 7th medication that I've tried in a year and a half.
9513,So yesterday at lunch me and my coworkers got into a discussion about the use of medications in the treatment of mental illness.
9514,"Of course the normal ""I've heard those types of meds change you if you take them"" ensues, and I start getting that familiar aggravated feeling in the pit of my stomach when I hear the same old typical misconceptions of mental illness."
9515,"Then another coworker says, ""Of course it changes you because you are just taking a medication and not actually dealing with the problem""."
9516,"To which I replied that is the only the case when you just have doctors throwing pills at you and not coupling it with therapy, and that the actual point of the medication is to lessen symptoms enough so that therapy can work."
9517,"I've been on a couple of different meds over the past year or so and I'm weaning off now, but I hate to think what would have happened if I had never been on them at all."
9518,My medicine choices are limited and even my pdoc is getting frustrated with how things are going.
9519,"I never disclosed my bipolar, I quit taking all my meds because they told us during orientation that we would be getting blood tests and they would be aware of any medications we would be taking."
9520,"I am on meds for major depression, I was given 300mg of wellbrutrin and then lowered to 150mg but they dont work."
9521,Im sick of medications.
9522,"I saw a psych and told them my meds werent working because I have racing thoughts/suicidal thoughts, he just upped my meds and advised to let him know if it has any adverse affects.."
9523,I get meds and start to do better.
9524,"After a while I feel so good I am like I'm fine,  I don't need any meds."
9525,"When I said she could get help, talk to a therapist or try a different medication she said she'd been trying these things her whole life and didn't want to start over again."
9526,"Just to be clear, I'm still encouraging my wife to take advantage of all the help offered, including the group therapy she's avoiding and I think as she stabilizes and starts new medications she will be open to it."
9527,"She is strong and with help and medication she'll be back to it, I'm sure."
9528,"The good news is that I can still have that pathetic excuse for a doctor write me refills for my meds (if she can manage to write them correctly...) without having to see her, but I'm still fairly stressed, hoping that the most recent changes to my meds keep me stable, since I won't have a pdoc I trust to go to if they dont."
9529,My mom tells me that it's all in my head and that I can get better and control it with meditation and vitamins and that I only want the medicine to have something to constantly take.
9530,When she said this I understood that I only wanted the medicine to get addicted.
9531,I have NEVER been able to constantly take any type of medicine without wanting to stop taking it or just forgetting about it.
9532,"Oh, you can try and outrun it with doctors, medicines, new technologies."
9533,"He is rapid cycling, and I'm not sure if he takes his medication regularly."
9534,Not for actual treatment (meds) but for occasional homeopathic use.
9535,"I stopped taking medication 8 months ago and have been using CBT tools, mindfulness and meditation."
9536,I'm planning to start seeing a therapist again soon but want to stay off medication.
9537,"I know the ins and outs of the illness, have large toolbox of coping skills from extensive dialectical behavior therapy training, and have experienced extended periods of stability on minimal medication."
9538,The quiet-brain meds aren't working today.
9539,It's something that wouldn't affect a normal person but I've been a bit anxious for a while and my meds haven't been working well so I started getting depressed.
9540,But this time stable on the right meds.
9541,"Also, if there are meds out there that are safer for bipolar and have helped any of you without any physical side effects (I need to run)."
9542,"I am sure that I am on day four of having the flu and didn't take my ADHD medicine today has a lot to do with the anger I am feeling, but regardless it is still there!"
9543,I listened and just said I may be going into an in patient treatment eventually to get meds regulated.
9544,I am just angry and scared.... And not on my medicine today....
9545,I stopped taking my medication and moved to Denver and saw a new psychiatrist (note- psychiatrist) who told me I wasn't bipolar and that the written test I took was bullshit..she gave me lexapro and I took that for a few weeks but I couldn't afford it.
9546,"I was in very good shape, working out daily until these meds."
9547,"I went off of Welbutrin, after my mom convinced me to try and deal with my depression without medication."
9548,"Junior year of college, I was diagnosed with PCOS and my endocrinologist learned of my previous medications, and he convinced me to go back on Welbutrin XL."
9549,"I saw him every few months, told him it wasn't working and he'd add another medication."
9550,"With all this medication, I’ve been researching the differences and whatnot."
9551,"tomorrow I will be taking Prozac, I need to know is this a good medicine to take, and has anyone had any side effects."
9552,And can people share their experiences with anti anxiety medication?
9553,I was prescribed medicine for it and they stopped.
9554,I can't sleep at all if I don't take my sleep medicine (doctor prescribed me ambien a few months ago).
9555,I don't want to be put on more medicine right now.
9556,It seems like now we just try to curb the symptoms the best we can with meds.
9557,My therapist just told me it could easily be two months before I can see a psychiatrist for meds.
9558,"It's my absolute last choice anyhow (thyroid issues in family), but especially for a short term medication!"
9559,So now I have to wait months to get medication while my work and school suffer in the meantime.
9560,"DVLA (UK) annd bipolar

I just discovered I might have to tell the DVLA that I have bipolar and that I'm on medication."
9561,"I'm taking this medicine to be able to function better after all, right?"
9562,"Being the genius that I am (not), it didn't occur to me to, oh I don't know, *take some anti-anxiety meds along just in case*."
9563,"It wouldn't be some cloaked sickness that was all in her head, something that could be ""cured"" by the right medicine dosage."
9564,I am now taking various medications to attempt to level my emotional states.
9565,"I’m confident that with the proper medication and support from friends and family, I can live an amazingly monotonous life."
9566,"When I get there, I disclose the medications I take for manic depression, in case this was related to high lithium levels, and that immediately sets off a red flag."
9567,"I was not acting out of line in any way, I have not had an episode of severe mania in 3 years (which I explicitly told the nurse who was taking down my information) and I've been taking medication consistently."
9568,"I've gone the medication route (tried many things on max does nothings worked), I'm not interested in the medical marijuana route."
9569,The only way I can sorta tell is when I am on a proper mixture of medications that has been working for me for at least a couple months.
9570,i'm getting to point where i'm seriously considering medication.
9571,i want meds now.
9572,"Due to the fact that I did not want to talk to people or take medicine, but now that I am older it is hiding me harder then ever."
9573,"It seems too soon for the medication to be working, I've only been taking it for two days!"
9574,"Kind of a silly thing to post, but it sure is frustrating when I need someone to understand what I am going through and I need someone there for me when I am changing my medication in fear of it reacting to me."
9575,I had one (takes 2h) therapy conversation each week  and i needs to sleeping some more meds (150mg quetiapin /as needed).
9576,"Since then she's gone to regular psychologist and psychiatrist appointments on campus at our university, been put on 300mg of Seroquel, and has explained bipolar disorder to her parents and gotten their full support with medication and counseling."
9577,"Her mom was just up visiting last weekend and they really made a lot of progress talking about medication and my girlfriend's disorder, and she was really scared her mom wouldn't accept her for it or be supportive My girlfriend's maternal-side grandmother was also severely Type 1 Bipolar."
9578,"I have stayed away from medications due to a bad experience, and have tried combating my problems with marijuana and exercise."
9579,"I haven't posted for a while, but after a recent emergency meeting with my psych, my meds were upped again and recently for the first time in a year I'm starting to see some stability, I've had 3 good days, small victory I know."
9580,I'm seeing a psychiatrist and on medication and doing all the necessary treatments but I'm just getting so tired of it all.
9581,"My first thought was that I'd forgotten to take my meds last night {seroquel 350mg, since you asked} but after several counts I'm completely sure I did."
9582,Thus ruining an actual positive day I was having with the anxiety of my grandfather possibly finding out things like how many men I've slept with in the last year and generally huffing about as they all do about how they don't believe I'm on the right medications or have the right diagnosis despite everyone holding my PsyD in the highest esteem and most of them on his calendar.
9583,"I have suffered from disordered eating for my whole life (not every fully anorexic, but having the tendency to forget to eat or skip meals knowingly or becoming harmfully addicted to restricting or over-exercising) and my weight gain on depakote led to me not complying with my medicine a few years ago."
9584,I am afraid that something similar is going to happen if i don't change my meds.
9585,"I know it isn't good to change meds without advice, but I feel like I'm just gonna keep gaining over the next three weeks, and I don't want to."
9586,so i take a strong mix of very well controlled meds and he added a new one without asking for any info and did not even check if i had a heart problem.
9587,he feels that if you do all the right things you dont need meds and you can work full time for the next 50 years.
9588,im having the usual bipolar issues mania is worse then usual but always is on serquel valium helps but im up and down like a yo-yo my doctor cant take me off any of my normal meds so im stuck with what im on minus the 2 at night.
9589,no amount of meds or treatment helps with that same as with the seeing and hearing things.
9590,I don't know if this is due to me stopping medication.
9591,"As far as medications go, I am medicated and after MANY trial and errors, I believe we may have found the proper formulation of meds for me."
9592,"I'm on 400mg of Lamictal and 20mg of fluoxetine, along with anxiety/sleep medications that vary as I build/lose tolerance to them."
9593,"I stopped taking the medicine about a month and a half ago to avoid getting angry at others like I was doing, and life has been miserable."
9594,I'm scared the meds are going to wear off or something and I'll lose this drive because anyone that has ever known me prior has already told me that I look more enthusiastic and more up beat than normal and it's been about a week of this.
9595,I started my meds on the 7th.
9596,"I have been to my GP about 6 times over the last year and told him I think about suicide and that my mood is not stable, and that I hate the way I look and my self esteem and confidence are at zero most of the time, but he is not willing to change anything about the current meds I am on until I see a psychiatrist."
9597,She doesn't want to take any medication if possible and is actively seeking to go to a counsellor.
9598,After the attempted robbery I spent many of my days self medicating with alcohol and removed myself off the medication I was taking at the time (lamictal).
9599,"Hey things are going way better for my, medication working much better than it used to, I decided to take charge of my own therapy and it is helping me a great deal."
9600,"The point is that when she takes her meds, she becomes depressed - so much so that she can't hold on to a job (my sister just found her a job at Kohl's, she lost it after a week following consecutive no-call no-shows)."
9601,"She's been on the same medication regimen for a while now (Depakote, Abilify and Wellbutrin)."
9602,Have you guys ever had to hide how you take medication?
9603,I think it's time for me to try medication again.
9604,"I don't mean to generalize there, but (like all medications) I knew it had downsides."
9605,The meds masterlist is overwhelming and I hope you guys can help me.
9606,I've been off of meds for years because I was originally misdiagnosed and had a very bad experience.
9607,"I am really hoping to avoid any medications that will cause weight gain because I get gender dysphoria and gaining more weight in my curves won't help that at all (not to mention I worked for two years to get down to my current weight, I don't want that ruined)."
9608,I'm also curious of the effects of drinking while on some medications.
9609,"I only drink maybe once every two weeks and very rarely in excess but I'd like to know how people may have responded to both having the medication and drinking so I don't do something incredibly stupid (because I'm invincible, of course)."
9610,"If you do know you're drinking that day, do you skip the medication for that day and continue tomorrow?"
9611,I just want to know what I'm getting into before he possibly gives me a medication that may not be the best for me.
9612,"So she prescribed Wellbutrin, but refused to prescribe anything along with it because she believes in prescribing one medication at a time and seeing how I react to it before adding anything else."
9613,I'm considering calling her and saying I want to not take my meds until I see her again next week - I have an hour long appointment.
9614,The medicine was legit reason I torn muscles in my chest wall then had plantar fasciitis.
9615,I was diagnosed about two years ago and have been on medication since then.
9616,I was doing fine on the meds until about 2 months ago.
9617,"I graduated college
I got a really good job
I got accepted into an international volunteer program 
I rekindled an old flame
I have been ""manic"" for 2 months now, started taking meds again and everything has been going great."
9618,"...is that no matter what you do, what lifestyle change you make, or what medication you're on, you're still going to cycle."
9619,"I was given medicine to take, which I didn't, and got better on my own."
9620,"I have since made arrangements to see a psychiatrist for medication, a therapist and even my primary care physician to see if there is a neurological or cardiac problem causing my sudden mood swing."
9621,I think the meds are messing with me.
9622,The meds I'm on right now solve the issue of me being suicidal.
9623,But I'm irrationally moody....I get so down I can't get out of bed it's worse then being of the meds.....I know that I should see a doc but I'm wondering if I should stop taking the meds for a bit might clear my head.
9624,I started taking the meds 5 years ago cause I had a very dark moment.
9625,But Ever since I started taking the pillsi haven't been able to hold down a job...I've switched around my meds quite a bit so I'm willing to see my doctor....but I feel weening myself of the drugs may bring me back....or maybe I forget how bad it was of the meds
9626,"I was medicated very successfully for several years, but I have recently (in the last year) stopped taking the meds because my husband and I are considering children in the near future and I didn't want the meds to still be in my system for fear of hurting the baby."
9627,I've been diagnosed recently by my psychologist a few weeks ago but have been taking medications for a few months.
9628,"We caught up some, her boyfriend, (who I ""got to"" meet when I visited her,) had just proposed to her, and she was having some trouble with her meds, etc."
9629,"Some people seem to be fine without any medication, maybe some other form of therapy works."
9630,Should I go to the ER for meds?
9631,Some of us have medication to help.
9632,Today's my first day on the medication.
9633,I'm so fucking mad that this isn't something I can work on and learn to control without medication.
9634,"I am an incredibly defiant and stubborn individual, going on medication for the rest of my life bothers me."
9635,I was diagnosed with depression in 8th grade and prescribed medication and a therapist.
9636,But before I could start on meds my parents pulled all help.
9637,"She was put on various medications, none of which worked."
9638,So in addition to quitting her job (8years ago) she went off her medication.
9639,She had about a year when things were absolutely terrifying after she quit her meds.
9640,"Long story short, I was put on medication for Bipolar 1 that actually worked well, but of course, nothing lasts forever."
9641,"After a brief hospital stay got stabilized on some meds, have been doing well seeing psych outpatient and have started putting my life back together with lots of support from husband, good family, friends and dr. 

Well, several months ago I weaned myself off the meds thinking I'm just going to manage via healthy lifestyle and would go right back on if I ran into trouble."
9642,"Every day I tell myself I'm going to restart the meds, but right before bed I tell myself, no, tomorrow will be different."
9643,But selfishly I'm pissed and resentful that I have to live on meds for the rest of my life to function normally.
9644,"Once my meds kick in I'll be fine, but I can't go off them again."
9645,"So, sorry for venting, but how do you manage to stay motivated to stay on your meds?"
9646,"Tl/dr: got complacent, went off meds, things started going to shit, how can I keep myself from doing this to myself again in the future?"
9647,"I had to go to a lot of doctors and try a lot of different meds, therapies, and life-style changes, but I figured it out."
9648,"I have bipolar type 2 and I chose not to take meds to treat it, even though all the people I saw tried to convince me, I think that I couldn't handle taking any because then I wouldn't be ""myself"" (for better or worse)..."
9649,"But when I see how awful things can get when I am ""down"" (basically the only way I don't hurt myself is most of the time by self medication-induced sleep), as well as when I am ""high"", I don't know if it would ""ethically"" be fair to have a child... My parents were never really involved in my life, so I know what struggle it can be not to have some ""real"" parental figure, and I am afraid that the bipolar disorder would cause pain to my child to witness."
9650,Do you take medications ?
9651,"I got out, went of meds, was broke for awhile, started a fairly successful online eCommerce website...    Everything went great for almost 9 years, and I was recently back in the hospital."
9652,"Hello, I have been trying to find a medication that doesn't raise my cholesterol, make me feel like a zombie, or make me gain weight."
9653,So I am back on my medication that raises my cholesterol and I feel fine mentally/emotionally.
9654,I didn't pay any out of pocket for 3 weeks in a public psych ward and all my meds are discounted through Medicare and because I'm low income at the moment.
9655,"I'm done with this stuff, I'll cope with the bipolar some other way meds can screw themselves."
9656,"I'm in a fine place, my meds work."
9657,just be good little boys/girls and take our meds ?
9658,"Hi guys,

Tomorrow is my first time to see a therapist, for the past few months since my diagnosis I have been seeing a psychiatrist who's job was to prescribe medication."
9659,I have bipolar II and am just now starting medication.
9660,"the thing that really gets me about this is that ive had to fight so hard to get treatment and to get people to take me seriously, and when she was in the hospital i was admittedly a bit jealous that she was getting state of the art intensive treatment and i was still floundering alone unsuccessfully looking for a therapist (i have since found a therapist but im still waiting to get meds after TWO FUCKING YEARS OF RAPID CYCLING)."
9661,"My background: raised by suspected undiagnosed bipolar mother, diagnosed with depression in teens, suicidal ideation reaches max years later, hospitalized, diagnosed bp2, given Prozac and Abilify, had terrible reaction to both meds, lost job, lost insurance, live in denial after being mortified, socially isolated self, been living untreated with bp2 since 2009, just now (five years later) starting to accept it all, realizing I need help again

Anyone here get diagnosed, have a bad reaction to their medicine, and then quit the mental health system all together?"
9662,I should mention that before I moved I was going to a psychiatrist and getting meds for free through the state because they had a program for mentally ill people that would cover some people.
9663,I ended up having a lot of medicine leftover and I take it sometimes.
9664,"I've been through a lot of meds, but my last prescription was for zoloft, welbutrin, and depakote."
9665,"I take the meds sparingly, usually when my mind becomes deteriorated to the point that I have trouble understanding and comprehending things, and I truly feel no sense of contentment from anything."
9666,"I'm a little afraid of mentioning it for fear of having a drastic medication change, so I'm trying to determine if I can white-knuckle through it and hope it lifts, or learn to tolerate it for as long as I am medicated."
9667,"When I was in treatment at 15, it just led to a shitload of medication and even worse side effects."
9668,"I've been on medication since January, and I'm emotionally fine now, but some of these past events are just too difficult to look at."
9669,Just started new meds a week and a half ago.
9670,"I love mania, and I don't want my mind to fog up 'cause of the meds, which a lot of people have experienced with the meds I'm on."
9671,My doctors think I am out of remission but I am hoping it is the medication.....
9672,I got on meds and seemed like I'd gotten it more under control.
9673,I had my meds tweaked.
9674,Is there anything I can do other than take my meds and see my therapist?
9675,I've kept up on medications faithfully for 4 years and still am good on that.
9676,"I have a great job, I'm self sufficient, and after reading all these stories about trying medicines, and the associated side effects or the manic periods I don't know what to think."
9677,I have a doctor appointment on the 24th and I would like to ask him to go back on the old medication but I feel like if I ask directly he will think I am seeking drugs.
9678,"I had been struggling with long term depression and had 2 manic episodes, the second one ending and leading to the meds a few weeks ago."
9679,I don't know the experience with meds any of you have had.
9680,He says that he's feeling less depressed (he's on meds and sees psychiatrist once a week) as of the last couple weeks.
9681,"My doctor said they don't want to raise the bupropion dosage any further, but im reluctant to ask for a medication change because there are so few side effects."
9682,"**If needed: 24 Yr old Male diagnosed as Bipolar 2, on a wide range of medications over the years and currently on Abilify + Trileptal + adderall + dicyclomine for my stomach**"
9683,"I've been diagnosed after I had an episode of mania after coming off of Lexapro, and was started on a regimen of mood  stabilizing drugs and have been on them for some time now, haven't felt the same since...but I am wondering if it was an erroneous diagnosis, and continuing the meds are inappropriate or unnecessary."
9684,This is the first time I have experienced any sort of mood fluctuation since I got on my meds and I don't really remember how I used to handle this shit.
9685,"I don't know if it makes a difference, but I am 235 lbs

I'm scared to take so much medication, I'm scared of sexual side effects, I'm scared of weight gain -but I'm also scared of staying the same and not getting better."
9686,Will the medication (when i find the right one) actually help me be stable and not change my mind constantly and be swinging back and forth.
9687,What medication helped you the most and didnt cause any nausea or dizziness?
9688,"So I've been going through the whole finding the right medications, and we all know how long and arduous it can be."
9689,"I'm not going to give up, but has anyone taken a break from trying out new meds."
9690,"I feel like there's other drugs I want to try but at my next pdoc appointment I wanna tell him lets just stick with my meds for now so I can catch up, it's like it's always coming up or down of some drug."
9691,His response was heavily against giving anyone who's Bipolar that type of medication due to the risk of bringing on an acute manic episode.
9692,"When I tried to tell this doctor what all was happening to me, he told me it was ""just because I was depressed"" and ""I needed to give the medicine longer to work"" (I had been on it for 6 weeks)."
9693,"Haven't messed up taking my meds in a couple months, at least one month, so I've been steadily feeling better."
9694,I'm really worried that I won't be able to complete school if I don't have access to my meds.
9695,"I this just sounds like typical bipolar whatever, but it was only like 2 months ago i got meds adjusted and was doing pretty good."
9696,"I'm having a lot of difficulty being supportive for my wife seeing as how bipolar runs in my family too (medicated and everything) and our side dealt with it naturally, we don't take meds, we go through our ups and downs and ultimately I feel like we're more dynamic people for it."
9697,"I've been taught that it's a biological reaction in your brain and if that's the case it's in response to something, whether it be an imbalance or something else, ultimately it's caused by something and she's already been on medication for an appropriate enough time for it to have an effect."
9698,"I've just been wondering lately if it's really worth being on medication -- I know the majority of you are big advocates of keeping with a strict meds regime, but I'm not sure my insignificant symptoms are really bad enough to warrant medication."
9699,I see my pdoc in about a month and I'm debating whether to ask her to go off medication.
9700,"I guess I'm just looking for validation that my doubts are normal, encouragement to stick with meds, or if anyone has been in a similar situation."
9701,Then I was told to stop my adhd meds and come back Monday.
9702,Or if I am experiencing an elevated mood I don't want to crash into depression because my meds change.
9703,"But I shortly after devolved some health issues and a crazy rash, and my doctor was afraid it was the medicines and took me off it."
9704,"But they put me on a medicine with an antihistamine in it that was supposed to also act as an anxiety medicine, but no depression medicines or anti-psychotics."
9705,"I'm also dealing with a really bad break up, without medicines."
9706,"So I guess what I'm saying is that I'm doing okay off the medicine, but it has been overwhelming trying to keep up with my moods, and the increased anxiety, which was caused several really bad panic attacks."
9707,"And don't tell me to get back on medicine, cause I wanted off it for months, so I'm taking that rash as a sign from God to try it."
9708,"If I get suicidal, I will return to medicine."
9709,"To make matters worse, they said it's my fault for leaving my medication out on the table."
9710,"Two weeks ago I asked to be put on Wellbutrin because I believe it will help me the most of all the meds I researched, taking into account my symptoms."
9711,I've taken my medication daily and seen a psychiatrist regularly for the past 10 years.
9712,"He said that I am doing very well, and that he thinks that I would do well in a serious relationship because I respond to medications very well and follow the treatment program very well also."
9713,"I stopped my meds, kicked my now ex husband out, spent money out of control,  half ass started renovations in my basement then abandoned the idea (I have ONE green wall in my basement)  and a bunch of irresponsible compulsive behaviours."
9714,She put down my medication from 1 g to 750mg.
9715,I'm hoping the low blood pressure is due to the meds and the summer heat.
9716,My meds generally slow this down to 1-2 per month.
9717,I did manage to eat last night through a combination of heavily aromatic foods and a special herbal medicine my friend gave me.
9718,I've just entered my info to try out My Med Schedule at http://www.mymedschedule.com/.
9719,Im on lamictal and it seemed to help but i couldnt get the shaking feeling that im not actually bipolar and with all these stories about doctors being over-friendly with medicines/diagnosis I almost thought I was overreacting.
9720,I stopped taking my meds for maybe 2 weeks.
9721,I still didnt take my meds.
9722,Like right now I'm a total mess and i just want the medicines to start working again..
9723,"Only a couple times, but it was obvious after talking to him that is was self medication, because he feels so damn awful."
9724,I was extremely fortunate to find a medication that managed my symptoms without sedating me and was able to move ahead with my life and family.
9725,"I mentioned my concerns to my OBGYN and she suggested increasing my medication or adding to the mix, but I was apprehensive as I had never had to increase my medications in the past and was concerned that it would have harmful implications on my mood in the short-term (note: I was assured the increase would not harm my fetus)."
9726,Should I just increase my medication already?
9727,"I don't mean to scare anyone away from any particular medication, I just want to know the reality of the dangers from first hand accounts."
9728,"I'm wondering if it's related to my medication (Paxil, Wellbutrin, Zyprexa, and Trileptal)."
9729,"I have told him that you do have to shop around a bit for the right psychiatrist and therapist, and you do have to take different medications until you find the right one(s), but he repeats like a broken record that he's ""scared it might rot my brain and turn me into a zombie"" (for some reason, he says, Xanax doesn't do this to him)."
9730,I had a bad reaction to the meds they gave me in the hospital (they usually over medicate you when your in an episode so they can bring you up or down quickly) and got a side affect where I had to constantly be in motion or else my legs would be on fire.
9731,"A lot of people think that medication for mental illness is a quick ""here's your pills and now you feel better""."
9732,"They have no way of knowing what medication will be right for you because everyone's brain and body is different, so you're pretty much playing guess and check."
9733,"It took me 7 months to find the right mixture of medication, but I've heard many stories of it taking a lot longer."
9734,My meds don't make me a zombie or a societal sheep (which is what I thought was going to happen in the beginning).
9735,"For some reason I can't get sleepy even with sleep meds and I've been having very enjoyable dreams and I just want to keep sleeping to dream more, as if reality isn't good enough or at least my own reality isn't good enough for myself."
9736,Also I've gained about 30-40 lbs since having been on my meds for a year and am unmotivated to exercise.
9737,"(I know I said I was diagnosed a year and a half ago but there was a period where I lost my job and medical insurance, so for about 6 months I was off my meds) 

a couple of other things going on is that I'm trying to quit smoking cigarettes and weed so I'm not sure if that could be making me feel this way but I've felt this way the past 2 months now and I just decided to quit smoking anything no more than 4 days ago."
9738,I have recently been diagnosed as BP 2 after two decades of being told it was major depression and medicine that made me worse.
9739,"I mean, in the hospital, they don't even give you any literature about your disorder or the medications they're putting you on."
9740,I didn't even know the proper spelling of my medications until the day I was discharged.
9741,"So, I weaned myself off my meds, WHICH I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE TO DO."
9742,"Extenuating circumstances prevented me from getting to my doctor, and my side effects from the meds were getting bad."
9743,"So I've been curious about this for the past couple weeks, since I've been adjusting to this medication pretty well and my episodes have been less frequent."
9744,I was put on medication and for a few months after my final medication adjustment I had been feeling fine.
9745,"(I am a 6th semester college student) But since I'm not functioning like I was at my worst when I wasn't on medication, I've brushed it off for a while, but it's come to the point where I really need help."
9746,"Hello everyone, I would like to collect some thoughts and arguments based on experience of most of you after seeing many posts on this subreddit explaining how meds removed the magic of life, and others saying how hard it is to be a bipolar."
9747,"First of all I would like to add that this post is only a discussion and not a way to prove that meds are bad, I am tapering my meds and getting back to being a bipolar, I would definitely go back to full doses for the sake of a better life even if I prefer personally being unstable emotionally and messy over being stable and zombie like."
9748,"Well let's start, based on a short duration experience (4 years, 2 years bipolar and 2 years on meds) here are my thoughts and arguments:

Living with meds:
Stable,
Oversleeping,
No emotions,
Useless ,
No motivation,
No studying,
Depression,
Careless in a ""where am I?"""
9749,"After a severe breakdown a few months ago, I'm slowly accepting that the traditional idea of having a career and having a relationship is unrealistic for me, even with medication and psychotherapy."
9750,I've had 32 medications in 50 or so combinations fail.
9751,I'm just scared of medication..
9752,"It seems like there's no success stories on this board, just harming themself attempts and ""I'm on my 7th medication guys, hopefully this one doesn't throw me over the edge""!"
9753,I guess people who have success with medication wouldn't ever come back to this board.
9754,Plus there's the fact that the medication costs around 700$ a month uninsured if anything happens or I'm not able to get my wits together by the time I reach 25 to get a full time job with benefits.
9755,Edit: Just some background: I started being a bitch to my fiancé after I went off my meds.
9756,"1)I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on meds, doctors and hospital stays."
9757,"Well, you can't really be creative when you are taking meds and if you stop taking your meds to become more creative you run the risk of blowing the fuck up."
9758,3)When I got my job I had to go get doctors notes to tell my employer that I am sane enough to work because I can't actually function in the real world without meds and a doctors approval.
9759,"Doctors are just throwing meds at me, but there has to more that just waiting for drugs to fix me (because they aren't)."
9760,"I wake up in the morning almost hypomanic and it calms down once I take my morning meds but damn, my mind won't stop, I need to do a million things all the sudden, and mouth won't stay shut."
9761,Has anyone noticed this after having the right meds starting to take effect?
9762,"Now that I've been on meds for a while, I've been able to recognize sarcasm more easily, and have a healthier amount of self-esteem to where I can laugh off things like people flipping me off in traffic, derogatory statements about my gender identity, or even just being downvoted for having an unpopular opinion on reddit."
9763,"I'd tell my parents that I think I might be a mild form of bipolar, but the idea of going on meds scares me to no end."
9764,"I was on ADHD meds on and off for a few years, and the idea of anything messing around with my brain now scares me so badly I start to quiver just thinking about it."
9765,"When I first found that I might be bipolar, the idea of meds kept me up in a state of paranoia half the night."
9766,Is there anyone who is able to manage bipolar disorder without medication?
9767,"I saw ""Silver Linings Playbook"", I know the film isn't universally loved by all especially for its aversion to medication and its perceived Hollywood ending."
9768,Or is it side effects from my medications?
9769,I will be starting treatment and meds very soon.
9770,"Could this be related to her bipolar disorder, which she doesn't take medication for because it makes her feel ill, also, how do I deal with it best?"
9771,I'm off meds right now.
9772,are the people who doubt that your medication is valid.
9773,Not quite so scared of this medicine or possible diagnosis anymore.
9774,"* 

* No more posting for diagnosis

* No more posting about medication help

* No more posting about anything that your doctor should be handling

Basically, we want a positive area, a safe area, a fun area."
9775,I know I need it and I've been fighting to get back on meds.
9776,This means I will be able to get meds again.
9777,Even in the past when I was on meds and more or less stable I was still always depressed.
9778,"I'm tired of trying medication after medication, and t doesn't help when I costantly have to switch doctors and they all disagree with each other on how to treat me and refuse to listen to me about how things work."
9779,I had to go off my medication about a month ago due to financial issues.
9780,My background: I've been trying to find a good medication for my mental health for about a year and a half.
9781,And it might help explain why the meds I've tried arent working as well as I hoped they would.
9782,"I have a lot of trouble identifying how my mental health changes on these medications--for the first two months or so of being on Effexor, I felt pretty great and happy and proactive and organized, so I was thrilled that I had finally found my ""miracle drug""--and then I crashed, and couldnt eat or get out of bed for almost a week."
9783,"When I go to my doctor and tell her that I dont think the meds are working, I feel.. ingenuine."
9784,I feel like she thinks I'm just looking for happy-drugs and that I'm clearly not suffering enough to warrant all this hassle to find a perfect medication.
9785,and I accidentally let slip the other day to my partner that I probably wouldn't because of medication I was on.
9786,Recently switched meds and found myself desiring intimacy and a sexual outlet.
9787,"I was asexual for three years on the other medication, but now it just consumes me."
9788,I'm still getting used to the meds I'm on right now.
9789,"He stopped taking all of his medications a few months ago, and his behavior has become progressively strange and antisocial."
9790,"I'm almost certain his decision to unmedicate himself was related to his religious conversion a few years ago...I am a Christian myself, but he seems to belong to the type that believes all medication is from Satan(as far as I'm concerned, one of his delusions)."
9791,"As for me, I've always refused meds - I don't trust the pharmaceutical industry, especially after watching years of failed psychiatry contribute to the failure of my parents' marriage."
9792,Any success stories with or without meds?
9793,"I want to ask my doctor to prescribe me Seroquel because I have seen in this forum it is quite a popular medicine, and a lot of you like it."
9794,I don't know what they'd make out of it since no one has ever really needed to go to a psychiatrist and rely on meds daily.
9795,"Sometimes I myself don't believe my dr and that I have bipolar (and then I stop taking my meds and get super depressed, fight with my SO to the point of almost ruining the relationship, etc)... *sigh* sorry, I didn't sleep a couple of nights ago at all and I'm still very unstable"
9796,"Listener 2 provided basic reminders about important things like therapy and medication, without giving advice."
9797,"Haven't picked up my meds yet (stupid pharmacy problems), so in the meantime I figured I would ask you all how you handled the first few months of dealing with it."
9798,Went to the pharmacy today to get a refill on my meds.
9799,I just got prescribed 10mg Fluoxetine today to go with my other medications.
9800,"I was ten and it caused no ill effects besides wierding me out until i just recently started to reflect on it at the age of 20, after going through three years of meds trying to fix or aid my anxiety/depression or whatever the fuck was going on in my brain."
9801,"I did not know was wrong at all, more medicines i tried- no results."
9802,"tl:dr used to be so full of life and felt euphoria for everything for three straight years in high school, now I am depressed and anxious and no meds have helped and i just need a few words of comfort and positivity that maybe lamotrogine will really help me."
9803,"I don't want to havve to abuse drugs to feel any connection to anyone, I want to be sober(besides effective psych meds) and live life the way i used to experience it."
9804,Possibly it's a side effect of my medication but I think my brain has been changing as I get older as well.
9805,I thought my meds were keeping me more or less normal.
9806,Why are my moods so off when my meds at lower doses have been normal?
9807,"If you do experience, what type of medicine do you take to alleviate the feeling?"
9808,Since then I stopped my meds and went without for ten years.
9809,I got on medication (depakote and risperdal) and now I'm super normal.
9810,"Please, just take your damn meds."
9811,"In the last two weeks I developed another case of akathisia, tried a new medication where I hallucinated and lost motor functions, could barely speak, etc."
9812,A week later yet another medication gave me a 2nd round of tardive dyskinisia.
9813,"I just started another medication that has urinary side effects, and immediately got a UTI after starting it."
9814,"I know that without medication I don't do well, and I want to stay mentally healthy so that I can live a decently happy life and also not kill myself."
9815,I literally feel like these medications are destroying my body.
9816,"After 6 years of taking medications regularly,  I'm now afraid each time I take a dose of my medications."
9817,Does anyone have any experience in missing meds for multiple days in a row?
9818,tl;dr: Acquaintance[32M] who I[30F] have been flirting with disclosed he takes medication for bipolar disorder.
9819,I'm now [reading up](http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/554128) that the other medication proven to treat bipolar depression is Symbyax.
9820,"But we could use some ideas for non-pharmaceutical, behavioral ways to improve sex drive--we'd really rather not add meds unless absolutely necessary."
9821,I stopped taking my meds because I couldn't get pay my doc to get the perscriptions.
9822,After a year on the latest meds.....
9823,"I had finally found a great meds combo, but the last two weeks have just been one long build up to the shit show that has been the last several days."
9824,"Doctors messed up my medication with refilling, and now I am dealing with really bad withdrawal symptoms."
9825,My medicine was perfect.
9826,My parents have this rule that I do not take medication or go to therapy while I live under their roof because they do not believe bipolar disorder is a real thing.
9827,Is it possible for me to stay this way medication free if I stay away from all triggers?
9828,"Needless to say this was not good for me, missing meds, off schedule, cycling again then getting laid off was the final straw, I spent almost 2 weeks in bed, let my meds run out and stopped taking them."
9829,I start taking my meds again (because my boyfriend is awesome and demands that I let him help me and asks me if prescriptions need to be filled).
9830,"It's a bit of a hard pill to swallow for me as it's made me realise that I'll probably never be able to do the things I did before diagnosis and medication (well, some of the things I did weren't nice before meds but you've gotta weigh up the pros/cons)."
9831,My current medications have been a miracle in helping me stabilize my mood but I'm struggling even more with academics than I normally would most likely due to the cognitive blunting effects of them.
9832,"I used to take meds when I was in high school, but since then I've stopped."
9833,"I'm a l m o s t off my bipolar meds (Lamictal) for the first time in five+ years, and everything feels really weird."
9834,Since starting the medicine my back has been better but my thumb joints have become awful.
9835,"Tonight despite my meds and sleep aids, it was still painful enough to bring me to tears."
9836,"So, to get back to my title, does anyone have any experiences to share about this medication?"
9837,"She is having to work very hard to keep up, because the meds affect her memory and make it hard to stay awake, so she is a little stressed."
9838,She is frustrated with the meds' side effects and is being very stubborn about taking them.
9839,I am hypo and haven't slept very well lately and forget meds most days then when i remember it is too late because my ex used to always remind me.
9840,"He wants to work with me in order to get me off my meds, and honestly, I want to punch the dude."
9841,I've tried several different meds for bipolar and I haven't found the right combination yet.
9842,"I (Bipolar-II) swear to the gods when I think the guy just can't get any worse despite medication and therapy, my father (B-I) has gotten sicker than I've seen him in years."
9843,"I don't get it: he was doing so good... taking all his meds, going to counseling, no drugs or alcohol, diligently working at his new job that has him swimming in cash (which is why he's been able to buy so many assault rifles and doomsday-preparation gear)..... and now he refuses to go to his doctor's appointment, freaks out at my mom if she says a word to him, and spends the day either in bed or pacing around grumbling about how awful his wife and kids are."
9844,"So my question is this:

If I can ""control myself"" and function without medication, even though I feel like I have these symptoms and they feel incredibly taxing, do I actually need help or am I just exaggerating what I'm feeling?"
9845,Does anyone here drink while on their meds?
9846,"I work out, take my medication everyday, and try to eat healthy but I still find my old demons coming out accompanied by days of regret."
9847,Maybe a phase in medication?
9848,I got off all these medicines.
9849,I have been off medication since August.
9850,"They either try and prescribe me medicine I have already advised them i am allergic too or knocks me out cold, all which is in my medical records Ive provided them."
9851,"I recently reached out to my Employee Assistance Program and they have been finding in network referrals but they have all been weird drug rehab centers, that accept walk-ins, I just don't want to go to someone and have them jack my medication up even farther, its a roller coaster to recover from, and mind you people, I am supposed to be maintaining a Corporate high stress job, support my own car housing food ect."
9852,Sure sometimes I have been prescribed meds but they never helped and by the time they were supposed to be working I felt normal again.
9853,I have been on these meds for at least 2 months now.
9854,She has also said I'm on the wrong meds.
9855,"I don't want to change my meds, but I can't put up with this."
9856,I have been on tons of ADHD meds and I had somewhat similar symptoms (so happy etc that I couldn't concentrate) and couldn't sleep too well but the doctor thought I was just anxious or something.
9857,Mom called the program today to see what stuff I have to bring with me and what not and my meds... Well Dr. Warner did not set up my appointment the right away so they can't say if I will get in or not....
9858,"I don't regularly miss my medicine, I've been very busy with summer and school stuff and while I was out and at others houses and such I forgot my meds."
9859,"That's my main medicine keeping me in check right now so now that the levels are off, am I screwed for the next couple days?"
9860,"So I ran out of the meds and have been off them for over a week now, waiting to get to the doctors."
9861,"At this point, I don't see a reason to get back on the meds with how I've been feeling the past few months and especially now."
9862,Should I get back on meds?
9863,Does anyone have any similar experiences with these meds?
9864,A little over 4 years ago i found out i was bipolar and was put on meds for a while.
9865,Any ideas on what I should do because I dont want to take meds again
9866,"Years pass and my depression wafts and wanes only once getting to a completely suicidal low, but, come 18, my depression which I had chalked up before as normal teenage angst (I thought the whole mental illness thing was a one time ordeal, I even told myself feeling suicidal is perfectly normal and healthy) continues to worsen, I start more often falling into suicidal slumps and, when not in those, I just feel all around irritable and shitty, to add to it, in the middle of the stress of college, I started having these kinds of flash backs to when I was on the medicine, I'd get really angry at myself with these intense feelings of self hatred, occasionally having periods of this high that I can only describe as feeling like I'm on stimulants (never done any, but it feels the way I've heard them described), my confidence goes way up, not ridiculously so, but I feel great compared to my usual self, social anxiety is also usually non-existent during this time, and I just have this intense feeling of euphoria."
9867,"Anyway after my first encounter with this since the medicine I did some googling and the only thing that I could find that describes this is bipolar, but whatever it may be, it has extremely negative repercussions on my well being, and I feel like just putting it into some stupid categorization such as bipolar would help, just knowing that I'm not some dumbshit angsty teen (19 now though) who needs to ""man up"" and quit being a little bitch."
9868,"Since I've been off the medicine though I've been going through extreme emotional turmoil, getting really suicidal, feeling worthless, becoming delusional thinking that my parents hate me, I'm a shitty person, or I'm deteriorating mentally and have poisoned myself in some way (lead, mercury, etc)."
9869,"EDIT: there has been a few comments showing that this med has really helped them, If you think it is something that may help you, talk to your psychiatrist or whomever prescribes your medication about it!"
9870,So I entered what I believe is a mixed state (sadness and crying a lot while being super angry and violent) possibly because of SSRI meds or something.
9871,I have been taking my meds every day.
9872,I'd say here a drink to success but bipolar meds mean no alcohol haha.
9873,"He is 27 next week, and has not been on medication for any significant amount of time since he was diagnosed as a teen."
9874,"This partially stems from his super religious parents who do not believe he has a mental disorder and will, therefore, not benefit from medication/counseling."
9875,"So, when he stopped taking his medication in his younger years, they did not try to talk him out of it."
9876,"I didn't take my medication because I couldn't get the valid information right away for my renewal, then the weekend hit without being forwarded the message back that it came in."
9877,He's been off meds of over a year now.
9878,"He's been like this for a month now, still refusing meds, and he's left the country to visit family,  so im not there to help him."
9879,"I'm at this point now where I'm used to the symptoms, I know how to take care of myself and I'm on medicine, but all of a sudden I don't feel in control anymore."
9880,I have no health insurance and I cannot afford my meds.
9881,I have enough meds to last maybe one more month.
9882,"Even when I had health insurance, every psychiatrist I saw (I saw 3 or 4 in the last 2 years) wouldn't change my medicine."
9883,They wouldn't change my meds because they saw that I was stable.
9884,"The only motivation I can find in that really far spot in the back of my head, that gets me going,  is the slight gleam of a future where I have a good enough job to buy medication."
9885,"Here's a few links from articles I've read:
(http://www.psycheducation.org/thyroid/introduction.htm)
(http://www.ehow.com/facts_5022169_hypothyroid-bipolar-symptoms.html)
(http://www.livestrong.com/article/29645-thyroid-function-affect-bipolar-disorder/)

I find this really interesting, because not only are both my parents on medication for hypothyroidism, but so are my grandma and grandpa on my mother's side."
9886,"If so, did you find balancing out your thyroid stimulating hormone via meds to help with your moods?"
9887,"I'm fine with where I am in terms of getting the help I need, getting meds etc."
9888,"How much he slepp/eat/meds
Med: oxascand 10 mg and one called citaloprm I think."
9889,I'm on all kinds of meds and it seems like they don't help at all and seems pointless to take them every day.
9890,"I'm not sure what all to do, especially since medication is not an option for me (my insurance will not cover it, and there is absolutely no money anywhere to scrape up to cover it)."
9891,Have not had the best experiences with prescribed medication.
9892,"Also, I was reading about how anti-anxieties can help with alcoholism, is it possible that taking this medication will help with my impulsive drinking (not yet alcoholism but getting there)."
9893,"I'm still working up to a therapeutic level of the meds she prescribed me when I first saw her (valproate), and I'm still having episodes."
9894,"Hi all, I was diagnosed with BP2 about a year ago and have been struggling with it for a while now but am doing a little better with medication."
9895,The amount of medication he has me on is kind of ridiculous.
9896,This is not my first time on medication.
9897,"He started me off on two basic medications: Lithium 250 mg 3x daily, and an antidepressant- Prozac, once daily."
9898,"After I stopped the meds, I settled for a few days and then I ended up in hospital for fainting spells and acute anxiety/dangerously high blood pressure."
9899,"I am in doubt about my psychiatrists competency as he barely says a word in our sessions, and frequently forgets different things about me that are essential in my treatment, such as major life events, and medications he has prescribed me."
9900,i have been off and on meds for atleast 25 years.
9901,i was not on meds at the time.
9902,"i was off and on meds during that 12 years, more off than on."
9903,so i have been without my meds since october.
9904,i wasnt on my meds and living with her and her boyfriend puts me in a bad mood sometimes and i took it to work with me.
9905,i dont have insurance still so i cant get meds for that.
9906,"The medication I take (Oxcarbazepine, 300 MG) has been working for me all this time, evening out my mood and decreasing the amount of times I experience my peaks and troughs."
9907,P-doc decided to change my meds hearing that.
9908,"Now, with my meds, I feel that my resistance to even a couple of beers is super low."
9909,"Is it the drinking, or the meds in general, that make me not as ""sociable""?"
9910,I was on a shitty combo of meds for a couple years (low dose Zoloft + Seroquel) that helped but didn't quite do the trick.
9911,~18 months ago an old psych decided we didn't know which meds were doing what anymore and pulled me off my meds to do a system reset.
9912,"Managed to make it to work most days, but ended up in a day program and had a lot of changes in meds."
9913,How many people have found the right combination of medication and therapy?
9914,"I've heard a lot of ""things will get better"" and ""we just have to keep trying meds until we find the right combination, which we will find, guaranteed""."
9915,"I did a quick google search and got mixed responses, all with those who were taking other medications that could have tainted them as well, or those who have been taking lithium for a while and it recently started happening."
9916,There's no medication.
9917,"Was this a ""We really need to adress these fears and get you onto meds, and I'm being COMPLETELY serious."""
9918,- I have an appointment with my doc and was wondering about introducing Adderall into the conversation about my current cocktail of medications.
9919,"I've tried taking the medicine at different times, and it's been about 2 months since taking it and the side effects have mostly worn off."
9920,"I have tried about 8 SSRI's Along with effexor and Wellbutrin.All of them didn't help any but plenty of side effects.Mostly when i take them it feels like a euphoric/super agitated/anxiety/foggy brain state.To me nothing obvious sticks out to make me think im bipolar but im not sure.in general i have the same problems when i don't take any meds, minus the euphoric feeling."
9921,"(been like that for awhile)

I don't have a diagnosis of bipolar but was started on lamictal and at the moment at 200mg.Still waiting to feel better.My question whats the likely hood of really having some form of bipolar if those meds did what i described to me?I chose to be off anything to do with serotonin because its not a good feeling like i would imagine it to be."
9922,If i dont feel better from the lamictal would he still give me those meds?This is just all new to me.thanks
9923,"he still sees his doctor and therapist, and i thiiiink he takes he meds, but i know he won't let the doctor change his dose or medication because he thinks he fine."
9924,Just got back on medication and I have found myself talking to me directly a large amount of time.
9925,Meeting on Thursday morning for meds.
9926,I've been on diagnosed and on medication for about two months.
9927,"About 3 weeks into taking the medication, I felt great."
9928,Anyone with bipolar 1 have especially good results with specific meds?
9929,"I'm currently on topamax 400 mg, lamictal 400 mg, wellbutrin 300 mg, prazosin  2 mg
I have tried a lot of sleep meds that did not work at all and several made me hyper."
9930,"I know there is a group of creative people who choose not to take medication, or only to take it during crisis periods."
9931,"I've always been too ashamed to go to a doctor because I always thought they'd give me the ""You're too young for ED medications""."
9932,I've read that ED medications are good for people on anti depressants.
9933,"I don't visit this subreddit very often, so downvote me to hell if this is supposed to be about getting help and seeing a shrink and taking meds."
9934,I also think one of my meds make me more awake after I take my meds.
9935,I know the whole deal with bipolar people not wanting to take their meds.
9936,But every combination of meds I've tried doesn't leave me in the middle.
9937,I stopped taking my meds about 2 weeks ago and I feel normal again.
9938,i have not found any meds that work other than the bandaid of clonazapam when I am so desperate to kill the pain that it usually combined with a drink and weed lulls me to sleep.
9939,but I'm on meds.
9940,I'm not on any meds at the moment and feel like I may be going manic again.
9941,Don't take meds just because your doctor tells you that you need them.
9942,"Also, we are in university, but she doesn't really have support from her family (which brings up a whole separate set of issues) or really any way to pay for medication/therapy/whatever."
9943,If you aren't taking the right stabilizing medications then you will go off the deep end and start engaging in destructive behavior.
9944,"Or is it genetics, because you didn't know you were bipolar and you weren't on medication?"
9945,"We cannot drink, do drugs, sleep late, sleep early, or skip our medications, because any one of these can cause us to relapse."
9946,"**PROTECTING YOURSELF**

Because something has to be blamed, and because you are in control of the flow of medications and behaviors you engage in, the only one to blame once in the hospital is yourself."
9947,"Maybe your friends can hear about the behavioral noncompliance to hide the pain, just not the refusal to take certain medications."
9948,"My moods just come and go as they please--and yes, that includes those ugly suicidal ones even on medication."
9949,"After four years on Pristiq and begging to be changed to something else, I decided to see a new psychiatrist to re-evaluate my treatment medicine-wise."
9950,"I feel relieved because I have taken my medication religiously, undergone regular psychotherapy and tried to push myself as hard as I can when I feel nothing inside and I thought that it was just my fault and I wasn't doing enough."
9951,The doctor is recommending a year of therapy and observation before even thinking about putting him on any meds even if its not bi polar.
9952,"I really don't wanna take more meds than I'm already on, and I don't wanna kill this part of myself."
9953,"I take medication, so it is not really noticeable unless someone saw me taking pills every day."
9954,"Diagnosis unknown 
Relocated at 10, suicidal at 12, temporary therapy and medication although follow up care was poor."
9955,"When I am feeling normal, I do not feel it is necessary to see therapists or take medication (poor follow-up)."
9956,Is there any medication out there that may help me get stabilized before then?
9957,"I'm hoping this inevitable crash won't be as rough as last year, now that I've got meds, but I am pretty scared."
9958,I want to get a diagnosis and perhaps start counselling or medication.
9959,I also fell off of taking my meds for nearly a month and went through a whole range.
9960,Went back to taking my medication as normal.
9961,"Fun Facts: My mom has had been on medicine for depression and anxiety for a long time and at one point her psych thought she was Bipolar but my mom was all like ""Nah."""
9962,"I was diagnosed two weeks ago, and yesterday, I finally started on medication."
9963,I don't remember the names but the meds are at home.
9964,How long does it normally take for these meds to work for you?
9965,"I was wondering if there was any way to harness the ""benefits"" of bipolar or whether thinking about trying to accomplish stuff during hypomania/mania means that you won't stay on medicine and will actively seek out mania."
9966,"He's helped me so much with opening up in psychotherapy, he makes sure I takes my meds and that they're not having terrible side effects, and notices my swings before I do sometimes."
9967,"I also take meds for ADHD (Ritalin), Anxiety (Buspar) and Depression (Prozac)."
9968,"I had not cried yet, the meds keep that all at bay."
9969,"I'm not going to lie, I eased up on the meds so I can FINALLY FUCKING feel something for once."
9970,"**Repost from r/BipolarReddit**

Okay, so this is sort of a response to my previous post:

&gt; http://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/24eh2z/need_opinions_on_cyclothymia_and_meds/


So it's been a week of doing my husbands schedule and tracking my moods."
9971,"So I thought: hey, it's not meds (which is what he doesn't want) and I'm not going to stop the schedule."
9972,"And whether he thinks the meds will help or not, he deserves a stable wife."
9973,He is not a medicine.
9974,"**tl;dr : I had a complete break down last night and after fighting with my husband, I've decided that I'm going to get help and get back on meds."
9975,"So my meds started not working as well, my doctor increased my lamictal, but that didn't help."
9976,"I was diagnosed with bipolar II very very young, and then my medication was *really wildly* mismanaged (to the point where my last psychiatrists was *baffled* by why my doctor would have put me on those things together)."
9977,"That more than anything, because the meds gave me parkinsonian symptoms so badly I was constantly in pain, and a history of abuse at home made me drop out of high school, then run away."
9978,"I know because I've been so goddamn poor and without health insurance until after Obamacare that I straight up could not afford anything but meds to help me sleep, which seems to be (*for me*) the best way to manage symptoms enough so I can work, but not *quite* enough where I don't have hypomanic days or days when my attention is bad."
9979,"I'm told I'm a little more stable, but the symptoms that bother *me* and hold *me* back-- social anxiety and sleep-- therapy helps more than meds ever did with the former, and just a sleep aid helps with the second."
9980,"I am on medication that doesn't help me for a goal I am skeptical of reaching, and the diagnosis is having consequences that don't outweigh the net benefits."
9981,"But I felt fine *off* most medication, and adding them hasn't improved it."
9982,"So what I'd like to do is explore the idea I could benefit from minimal medication, hopefully with a supportive doctor."
9983,I am having one of those days where I am questioning my diagnosis and wanting to stop my meds.
9984,"This resolved when I stopped the medication within a few days, so I thought it was just a bad drug reaction."
9985,"I told the neurologist that I wasn't really bipolar and my doctor was just a drug pusher, and that I should discontinue meds."
9986,"I was horrified by the teality of the side effects of meds I wasnt convinced that I really needed.Deep depression followed after I stopped the lithium, no manic anything, though I was still taking effexor."
9987,"My gp prescribed zyban as a booster, and I switched into another mixed episode, followed by a major depression when I stopped those meds."
9988,"I don't like therapy, or taking meds and I especially don't like paying for them."
9989,Maybe I am wasting thousands in therapy and meds.
9990,I caught my mother going through and counting my meds the other day while locked in my bathroom.
9991,My doctor is being a real dick and long story short I'm likely gonna be without meds for the rest of the summer (2 months).
9992,"She's now stabilized on meds but has developed an extremely anti-social, negative, borderline fascist/violent worldview."
9993,My parents we're always encouraging her to get help in the form of medication and a psychologist but she never did.
9994,"Each time she then goes off the meds, has another psychotic break, gets arrested, then hospitalized, then its the same old story."
9995,"She claimed she was forced injections of depakote, with can result in seizures, and a bunch of other strong medications that would result in her dementia."
9996,She is on a medication that makes her pretty stable.
9997,My view is that through years of medication and therapy she can hopefully find a less angry worldview and begin to re-join society.
9998,On meds but that trigger is still a problem for me.
9999,"I never considered I might have ADHD, but decided to try the medicine."
10000,"i finally have access to all my meds, so I'm about to start taking them."
10001,"this has never happened before and its way too late to call my dr. seems like a silly question, but they say to never play around with your timing of meds lie that."
10002,"I'm worried it's because I have been drinking so much, mostly gatorade, or eating too salty of food, but I have to drink on these meds!!!"
10003,"I've tried every medication in the book, been through a ton of doctors and therapists, friends and religious people try to help me out but it all just comes back to this damned question...what's the point?"
10004,"I have these under control, for the most part, with meds."
10005,"My psychiatrist eventually gave up on me, given my long history of failed medication trials and my terrible reaction to the Prozac + Ability combo."
10006,"I'm just worried that if I tell my shrink that I think there might be more to it, he'll take away my meds.. No way I could pass school without them."
10007,I've been reading about many careers and see how they don't want people with a mental illness working for them especially if they're dependent on medication to make it through each day.
10008,"I was committed to the psych ward where they diagnosed me as bipolar 1, then 3, then 6 and I went through a lot of different meds, none of which actually seemed to solve the issue."
10009,"**

***

I work as a customer support rep for a government drug assistance program, and sometimes we get callers who (understandably) get easily confused or mixed up because they should be medicated but aren't, or their medication causes them to get confused easily, etc."
10010,"So, this is my fourth day without taking the meds."
10011,"I don't dislike the medicine, I don't have adverse side effects, I just...stopped taking it."
10012,Has anyone tried taking Vitamin B9 to help replace the Folic Acids that are not being properly produced (as read on crazymeds.org)?
10013,I've lost ~30lbs on three separate occasions in the past three years only to gain it back from medication.
10014,"I got arrested for shoplifting (twice) a couple months ago, and basically went nuts for a few weeks until I got the right meds and calmed down."
10015,"Racing thoughts

Recklessness

Suicidal ideation associated with the flat haziness medication produces."
10016,"Self medicating-cannabis-(occasional nausea, muscle spasms and nerve ticks as well as the ""high alert"" associated with PTSD and medication side effects)."
10017,"I tried going back to college afterward (this was over the winter holiday), but the meds they gave me fucked me up (I have since been informed that I was misdiagnosed)."
10018,"I got close, but presumably because of the excess and the bad meds, I ended up depressed."
10019,"At home I quit taking my meds and continued to smoke, though my reasons for doing so had changed."
10020,"He said that that the former is sometimes thought of as a subset of the latter, but also that the hospital I visited had given me the wrong meds."
10021,Only my phyc doc when I tell him how my meds are working.
10022,I've struggled with anxiety/depression since I was thirteen and I'm on about five medications.
10023,"I plan to stay on my meds, so don't worry there."
10024,He started taking his medication again and WE communicate now like we have needed to for the past six years.
10025,I was wondering if anyone is managing their bipolar disorder without taking medication.
10026,"If you are medication free, please say how you manage bipolar disorder and what you do for the lows."
10027,"You get diagnosed and are told that this is permanent, and that you must constantly keep appointments, and constantly take your medication."
10028,"It's almost like being terminally ill, but with medication you can extend your life, if not change the quality of life you lead."
10029,"The medicine wearing off, is where the heart break lies."
10030,"So I've been going to therapy, taking my meds, and smoking weed to keep myself from cracking."
10031,I am almost to the point of hospitalizing myself just to speed up the process of getting back on medication.
10032,I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and PTSD late last year and have been on a steady stream of medications since.
10033,"In fact I feel almost the way I did before I started my medication, only without going crazy in the throws of episodes."
10034,"The only things out of the ordinary for me this past week or so have been that I've had a cold, so I've been taking my meds earlier in the evening and sleeping earlier due to general exhaustion, and I saw my father for the first time in 2 years last Friday (we're estranged as he played a significant role in the events that lead to my trauma)."
10035,"I got injured, had a disc replaced in my neck and because modern medicine doesn't fully understand back injuries ,I am stuck with chronic pain."
10036,I have gotten prescriptions from my university's health center for depakaote since i have had a prior history for the manic episodes however i have never taken them or any other medication.
10037,should i tell my doctor that i am not taking the medication and have not done so for over 2+ years without any hint of bipolar disorder?
10038,or should i not do this and instead get on the medication in order for him to write the report?
10039,I am extremely against taking the medication if i feel the real reason for my mani was caused by my smoking rather then a actually being bi-polar.
10040,"I don't know what to do, because my psychologist is an intern and can't give formal diagnoses or prescribe medication."
10041,"I'm bipolar II, managed well on meds (and bourbon) and have tolerated working and going to grad school full time."
10042,"I had that ""Did you take your meds today?"""
10043,"I didn't take my meds for awhile because I just kept forgetting and bam, I have $3.86 in my bank account and I slept with my ex."
10044,Currently she does not take any medication for this.
10045,"I took my meds and am watching a Rush DVD to remind me that there is something still pure in the world- music by musicians who care, lyrics from a lyricist who crafts his words with care and speaks directly to my heart."
10046,This doctor recommended I accept long term medication (I refuse meds until someone who actually knows me recommends them) and referred me to a bunch of psychiatrists.
10047,I never went back to him or called anybody about those meds.
10048,I refuse to take any medicine.
10049,On the medication merry go round for a while.
10050,Was misdiagnosed with adhd and my meds finally sent me into a manic episode like no other.
10051,"I've done meds, they made me paranoid and gave my passing white polar bear thoughts a constant second screen in my field of view."
10052,"I was starting to own to my mistakes, saying ""I apologise, it's just me going crazy, the meds have nothing to do with that""."
10053,Fuck the meds they cost me a friendship.
10054,"I want out, I want to stop taking my medication."
10055,I want to stop all the meds and pretend my brain is normal like I used to.
10056,"And while it's true there are other medications I could take which may squash the mania all together, they unfortunately sap my energy and introduce so much 'brain fog' that other parts of my life are negatively affected to a point of causing lethargy and depression."
10057,I thought my life was a wreck until I began the roller coaster that is finding the right medication.
10058,His diagnosis was 3 years ago but he refuses medication (he's worried he would never get insurance again).
10059,"He read about how to manage without medication (eating right, exercise) but he won't do those things either."
10060,"I feel *so sure* that there is a reasonable explanation for bottles of liquor in my shower and a seemingly never-ending supply of extra-strength cough medicine - *I'm an ""insomniac"", I need this stuff to get on schedule!"
10061,"I think I always have, even when I started my medication for my bipolar disorder and ADHD, but I was happy then."
10062,I see my psychiatrist on the 11th about my medication and I'm scared I'll do something stupid before then.
10063,"I feel stupid because I've tried to take a normal schedule for school and I can't even handle it with medication, but in high school I handled school without medication."
10064,So I'm debating whether I should go back on meds.
10065,I really don't want to get off Abilify as it's the least sedating medication I've taken for my condition so far.
10066,"I started medication because I wanted my children to have a happy healthy mom, and instead they get me - unmedicated and with a ton of health complications now."
10067,4 years of therapy and meds and monitoring with only 2 inpatient situations..
10068,A few months ago I stopped taking my meds because I don't know who I am - if that makes any sense at all.
10069,"I felt like my meds might have been dulling everything, but I wanted to feel emotions so I could deal with this."
10070,My moods are constantly shifting day to day despite the medication I take.
10071,"And the meds, they're even worse."
10072,"And some of the meds in particular (like xanax) is addictive and I don't want to even bother with that, but I can't help but to take it because it helps with the extreme anxiety I feel everyday from all these manic episodes."
10073,"So keep your chin up, go to therapy (if you want), take your medicine (PLEASE), and put on your best fake smile and face the terrible, cruel world, because it gets better :)"
10074,I'm not on any of my medication right now.
10075,Take meds for awhile then just gradually stop.
10076,Then I end up in a bad place...like I am right now...and I know I need to get back on my medication.
10077,I know the only way to fix it is to take my medication.
10078,Does anyone else know they need to take medication but have a hard time actually doing it?
10079,I need to get back on my medication before I get even worse.
10080,Since I don't want to leave y room I can't take my meds so I can feel better.
10081,I'm thinking about just making some chocolate milk and taking my meds with that.
10082,I am so sick of of feeling like this and my meds.
10083,Every day it's a fight with myself to take my medication.
10084,"I have been managing my bipolar II off meds for almost 2 years now, and doing pretty well, considering how I was before meds."
10085,I took medication half of my life but the truth I never felt that was working for me.
10086,"It's a stupid paradox, you take medication then you lose your energy then you don't exercise then you get fat then you are not more confident then you need the medication."
10087,I decided by my own to left behind the medication and start my clean life again all the opinions from my doctors.
10088,I'm also stupid because I choose the worst moment in my life to try to live without medication.
10089,I'm out medication for 6 weeks today.
10090,My dad tells me to get off my meds weekly.
10091,"I've been bipolar for twenty years and it has never seemed to changer, no matter what meds, no matter what context."
10092,"I notice that if I take my medicine, and then start doing things, once it kicks in, I'll get absorbed and next thing I know a few hours have passed."
10093,"All my past experiences were when I wasn't diagnosed yet, but I'm sure my baby drinking and extreme bipolar are the reason why when I had no meds, but was drunk, I was a fucking monster."
10094,"Does anyone have any other idea/possible medications to suggest, especially from people who have had bad experiences with the Lamotrigine?"
10095,"Hi I am taking lithium right now and are about to switch to Valproat and it is making me quite nervous, I guess it's the many years of watching my brother get sicker and sicker trying out different types of medicine, and getting turned into a zombie, that scares me the most."
10096,"So my longterm, live-in boyfriend has recently stopped taking his meds, and occasionally, he decides he wants to break up."
10097,"This sorting out meds thing sucks, really really sucks..."
10098,"And the meds...  well seroquel took the edge off but wasn't really doing it's thing so just takign it for sleep now, but last night... didn't help at all."
10099,"I mean, I'll be starting a medication and seeing a psychologist... Just wanted to hear from other sufferers (or whatever we want to call ourselves)."
10100,"I was on and off valpro for a few years, for some reason in mind I felt like I didn't need to take medication so every year or so around summer I would become increasingly elevated
then later manic."
10101,"I was on meds efexor and valpro, but
I had high stress from deadlines at work."
10102,"And before you start, yes, I'm taking meds, and they're pretty great, I'm in therapy and taking it seriously, documenting, meditating, and I know it will pass, but sometimes, it's just hard to keep those demons in their box."
10103,"I think I need higher dosages or another medicine because I go through these phases where I will have sex with 2-4 guys a week, sometimes 2 in one night."
10104,I forgot my meds on a trip and went without 5 days.
10105,I'm wondering what are you experiences with quitting your meds
10106,I just want to accept that I'm going to have bouts of serious depression and that meds won't ever help.
10107,"For the time being, my boyfriend is off the meds he takes for bipolar disorder."
10108,"He's not against the medication, he's just off it for the time being until he gets a new doctor and his prescription renewed."
10109,"In those moments, I don't want to take medicine or see a therapist, I just want to be normal."
10110,"I stopped going to the therapist because she was pushing me to get on meds, but I still wanted to be able to teach in China if I wanted, and you can't get a proper work visa if you have psychological issues."
10111,"tl;dr Diagnosed bipolar, but not on meds or going to therapy."
10112,Thanks to you all I am going to see a psychiatrist to get some meds and talk it over with someone.
10113,I will update with meds/sessions and how they go; mainly though I wanted to say thank you to people in this thread.
10114,They seemed to go away when I was on medication (lamotrigine) but I've stopped taking it and now the are back.
10115,I just got put on this medication and hopefully it will help.
10116,do any of yall know anything about or have had experiences with this medication?
10117,It is meds or me?
10118,"I'm on medication and have a counselor, but neither seem to fix the issue completely."
10119,"I was on and off of meds for a few years, while also doing my fair share of recreational drugs."
10120,"After being off medicine for a while, I decided to also clean up my act and start getting my life together."
10121,"(For reference, I have never before been to the ER nor even been hooked up to an IV for any medication.)"
10122,"I had an abusive counsellor (who was sleazy with me, thought I shouldn't talk to my parents to much anymore and finally decided to come into a session with an erection which just made the PTSD that I was dealing with 5X worse), other counsellors defending abusive counsellor, before that a counsellor who secretly listened to my father tell her his side of the story for an hour before ever talking to me and kept it a secret for a year of counselling me until finally she saw I was a good person and felt guilty and told me (and this was one of the ""good"" ones), then she decided she couldn't talk to me because she had to include God in her counselling and I didn't believe in God or want him included and she couldn't not do that, a psychiatrist putting me on ADD medicines which made me anxious and angry, before this I was on antidepressants which just made me feel unmotivated and pretty lousy."
10123,And it is hard to seek help when the help is abusive or gives advice that isn't helpful/medicine that doesn't help.
10124,Has anyone ever taken these 2 meds together before?
10125,I am hoping it isn't the meds doing this to be because if it is I'm not sure when it will end.
10126,"If it isn't the meds then I should be better in the next day or two, if history repeats itself."
10127,I can't take it much longer so I hope it isn't the meds.
10128,Last week I went to a new doc since I ran out of medication.
10129,"My internal medicine doctor prescribed Adderall to me 3 years ago, and I have done every 3 month visit so he knows I'm not abusing it."
10130,"Because it's working I just ran out of meds so I got really, well, bipolar."
10131,I just needed my meds to get back on track.
10132,"TL;DR: new doc wants to change almost all meds from my old doc, but I feel that it's taking a step backwards."
10133,"Noteworthy, none of current available medications for BD showed all these features: 1) tianeptine exert opposite effects than chronic stress in neurons, increasing neuroprotective factors what may help to quench the cycle of affective episode recurrence and neural and deterioration; 2) tianeptine affects neuroplasticity in the hippocampus and have been reported to increase dendritic lengths; 3) tianeptine increases BDNF levels in the amygdala; 4) tianeptine attenuated stress-induced glutamate release in amygdala; 5) tianeptine has anticonvulsant properties via adenosinergic A1 receptors; 6) tianeptine has analgesic effects."""
10134,"It seems like this is a fairly unique medication, I'd love to hear thoughts and experiences."
10135,I know stopping my medication is a bad idea but I'm so addicted to this feeling.
10136,He is a great guy when he is on his meds.
10137,I realized that an episode was coming and I began asking/checking if he was taking his meds.
10138,"If I didn't say before, he is very smart and capable but at this point I realized incapable of committing to his medicine and his doctors recommendations."
10139,She refuses to take any medication.
10140,"The meds have taking to much I got no ambition, I just exist that's it."
10141,My MD is a pretty good pdoc and I'll touch base with my physiologist next week... Ok I'll do it Monday procrastination that seems to be a new skill these damn meds have given me as well anyway back on topic.
10142,"Then I went to pharmacy, since I run out tomorrow and I had not filed yet because I wanted to be sure the meds would not change, since I am low on money as it is."
10143,"Instead of what I had budgeted this month for medicine, the total is 5 times that amount, which would mean I would not make rent if I paid."
10144,She had just switched her meds the week before.
10145,"Reading up on bi-polar meds I get the impression this could have effected things, however I am no doctor, simply painting a picture with words here."
10146,She said she was not feeling well (perhaps the new meds) and was on the coach.
10147,Even went as far as to offer to try some of her meds (obviously before understanding all its effects entirely) to see what she goes through or even be part of her sessions with the head doctor if needed.
10148,This all seemed to coincide with her changing her meds perhaps.
10149,All meds in all doses just cause mania.
10150,"If I'm off meds, though, I feel depressed, to the point of suicide."
10151,"I was looking for some street drugs, or some other way I could use my meds to drain out the rushing water."
10152,I learned that one of my medications has been called really poor mans coke.
10153,Should I switch medicines?
10154,That's most of the meds I've been on in the last two three years.
10155,I'm so tired of doctors visits and failed meds.
10156,im waiting for my meds to kick in.
10157,Now on the medication with caffeine I feel motivated and it may be hypomania.
10158,"I started medication recently--I've kind of lost track of time, but within a month."
10159,"For medications, I started on Wellbutrin, but over the course of a month, I reacted badly to the meds."
10160,I'm scared of taking medication.
10161,"I was diagnosed as bipolar a few days ago and put on a new medication, it's been hard to adjust to it so far so I'd say my bad days are worse."
10162,medication/counseling.
10163,After awhile it seemed like the meds stopped working and I went a few weeks and never felt better.
10164,I feel like my meds only work sometimes and make me feel like ripping my skin off because I feel constricted.
10165,"The meds make it easier to fall asleep, but I wake up more and sleep less.I'm sick of the instability."
10166,"I have had my medication (Lithium, Lamictal, and Effexor) adjusted once a few months ago."
10167,I don't want to keep calling my psychiatrist and having my meds tweaked when I keep losing weight and this will keep happening.
10168,Eventually I just stopped taking my medication (I was on Sertraline and Trazodone.)
10169,I've been off off meds for 9 months and don't want back on.
10170,"Unfortunately, I don't have the health insurance for a psychologist or medication, or really whatever I need."

10172,Mine usually last 2-3 months if I'm on my medication.
10173,"Anyone who is bipolar (I hope) may be able to understand the memory loss that comes with 1) long manic episodes or depressive one episodes and 2) medication fogginess...I don't know how to put this one exactly, maybe someone knows, and I hope they do."
10174,"I've been doing good since i started taking meds so i do not worrie about if im able to praktice medicine or not, I've had had doubt for some periods of my life when i was untreated and having very rapid symptoms."
10175,this will be my first real medication to treat my condition.
10176,Met with a new psychiatrist and we opted for a change in meds (Previously 20mg Lexapro) and switched to 1mg klonopin and Prozac.
10177,Does anyone have experience with this medicine?
10178,i haven't started taking the meds yet.
10179,"Since then i have started medication (lamictal up on 100 mg atm) and i have not noticed much, but i have notced i have been more ok, at least since i started looking for help."
10180,I went to a room where they lined up 2 cops and 8 doctors/nurses asking me to take medicine I have no idea what is.
10181,"This really wouldn't be that much of a concern if it wasn't for three things:
1) she refuses to take medication."
10182,"She has mentioned many times that she tries to handle her disorder with ""proper"" diet and exercise, and, while manic, she is extremely paranoid about people involuntarily putting her in the hospital and giving her medication."
10183,"We have entertained the idea of going to probate court and asking a judge to involuntarily commit her, but we live in a state where they basically hold her for 72hrs, give her some medication, and send her on her way."
10184,"Well I noticed that when I started taken the seroquel the very first time, my throat got sore but not thinking that is could be the meds but just a normal sore throat because everyone that I had been around had been sick including my kiddos."
10185,Give me meds and sent me home after some of the swelling went down but I began to notice that as soon as I stated to take my meds again my throat got so sore again.
10186,"Fed up with not knowing wy I wasn't getting better I began digging into as much about my meds as possible, and what do I find call dr ASAP if you have any of the symptoms,could be fatal!"
10187,"So I immediately stopped all meds, and complete hypo mania took over,and this was the first time I realized what I was experiencing, my mind was like a pin ball machine, I was everywhere inside and  out!"
10188,Anyone here with a cocktail for sleep except the regular medication?
10189,I started taking depression meds for my suicidal tendencies about 15 years ago.
10190,We added a variety of anxiety meds starting about 10 years ago.
10191,"I forgot my Lamictal today so I need to go bed before I get mega stressed and end up taking it (no, not because it gets out of my system but because I feel like a failure when I forget to take my meds and that really irritates me, so it's just Mirtazipine and Risperdal for today)."
10192,"Hi folks, 

My friend had a severe manic episode last night, he's on meds, lying in bed and feeling like shit."
10193,Is it the medications?
10194,It makes me feel like people think I depend on medicine because I am not strong enough mentally or because I just don't feel like putting the work in.
10195,"Before going to the trouble of seeing a professional, though, I want to know if it's worth it, given that I have no plans to ever take medication."
10196,"I would love to PM with someone who has Bipolar syndrome but that questions the world that claims they have a problem or the field of ""medicine""."
10197,The reality is that the positive perspective of psychology and medication will not be revealed in this film.
10198,I really hope this movie isn't one where the protagonist realizes he didn't need the medication after all.
10199,"Have been on a rather harsh anti-psychotic for about 6 months in the past, this has completely changed my view on medication and brought in a fear factor."
10200,"The reason I want anti psychotics is to control hypersexuality, this is the only reason I am taking medication in the first place and will be the only reason why I'll continue in the future."
10201,This being said I can't have medications which will kill my sex drive all together because they will then throw me into the other extreme and make my life as useless as it is now.
10202,"Took my anti-anxiety meds, Buspar and whatnot, and thought it was all a joke."
10203,"I took my medication and cried for two hours, barely able to remain sitting."
10204,I'm off meds.
10205,"I still have Xanax I can take as needed, but have been off meds since September because I was planning to try for a pregnancy."
10206,He started me on ADHD meds and anti-depressants and will re-evaluate in two weeks after seeing how I react to the meds.
10207,"Anyways, does anyone know of meds that curbs anger, or any other non-med techniques?"
10208,I'm taking Latuda and Lamictal right now for my meds.
10209,"Everything has been hard, adjusting to medicine, adjusting to having a record, and adjusting to coming to terms with having bipolar 1."
10210,"-Also I would love to know about the medication you folks are on, if insurance covers them, if they're expensive, etc."
10211,"I would experience those confidence changes almost daily, but now that I'm on the medicine I feel great."
10212,"Has anyone here ever been put on meds and felt weird, almost like immune to feelings of happiness then gone off their meds and felt a lot better?"
10213,"Also, I don't take any pain meds, just an anti inflammatory because in the past different medications have exacerbated my moods and irritability."
10214,I just want to see what it's like without medication since I've been on all sorts for years.
10215,She had been in the previous day with the first doc throwing anti-psychotic meds at her and sent her home.
10216,They have seen me happy on medication.
10217,This has come from acceptance and medication.
10218,The medication I am extremely grateful for as I'm finally feeling some choice in my life.
10219,Two years of medication and therapy has restored me to basic operating levels.
10220,"No matter what medicine I am on, no matter how much sleep I have gotten, no matter - I never intend to do it, but it is also never far from my mind."
10221,I use to not sleep at all then I got on medicines for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and all I did was sleep.
10222,"I stopped the meds, didn't sleep, and got committed..... Now I sleep some but not enough and before the sun goes down I want to crash."
10223,My meds are working but not where they need to be.
10224,"I've been smoking weed for forever, though, and it ""fixes"" the bipolar fine, but I've been trying to quit, and I just have too many underlying things, like the Bipolar and the insomnia and the anxiety, that I just can't stand it, and it means my meds aren't working but I""m scared to try anything new, but really what will happen?"
10225,I get so lonely sometimes that I feel like overdosing on medications because I feel like I will always be lonely.
10226,nurse practitioner sent me here to pick a medication that might be right for me.
10227,I've tried over a dozen medications and nothing has worked.
10228,"They decreased in frequency as I grew older, and decreased further upon psychiatric medication."
10229,"Recently, I've been taken off my normal medications due to the development of twitches, and my migraines have startedreoccuring."
10230,I'm asking because I've recently had to start dealing with the fallout now that I've got meds and the rest sorted out.
10231,I'm done with medication.
10232,I've been on and off meds for 15ish years.
10233,"It was from Sudafed, our Claratin.... ""harmless"" otc meds."
10234,I'm not comfortable telling people and trying to hide adjusting to the medication while at a new job has been really hard.
10235,"Please clarify if the effects you experienced were while taking medication, or without medication."
10236,"As a medication advocate, I know how preposterous I sound."
10237,"Yet, I really don't want to take my meds since they make me tired and I have lots of energy right now that I don't want to kill."
10238,"At the same time, the figurative voice inside my head is telling me that is definitely not a good idea, but what is one night without meds?"
10239,She was upfront about telling me she was bipolar and on medication.
10240,In Australia the two primary medications for bipolar are lithium and epilim(depakote).
10241,"Confirmed it both times from two different doctors, as their subsequent medications worked, and it put together all the pieces of everything we'd talked about during therapy."
10242,"Refused meds for a while again, other than Ativan."
10243,"I was barely making enough to pay rent and buy a bit of gas with my meager earnings, with food and medicine being paid for by the state and the county."
10244,"Going goos with meds go manic, get even again causes migraines, get right Mama R dies, graduate oceans get in a depression -rapid cycling, trying to improve things and adjust meds and finally see dermatologist car is totaled from flood."
10245,"I can't get up off my couch and because of my medication my energy is so low, even if I went out I'd be a wallflower at best."
10246,Has anyone else been on this combo(not necessarily specific to those psych meds)?
10247,The meds are currently working great for me so there's no way I'm stopping them.
10248,"I was originally misdiagnosed as ADHD and put on 2 different meds, vyvanse and adderal."
10249,Not happy with trying meds again or a blood test etc.
10250,I had surgeries 3 years ago and was on and off pains meds and didn't like it at all.
10251,"So, I've had a hatred towards medicine, more so a fear."
10252,"The first places I went, they intentionally overdosed me on whatever medication I was taking at that time."
10253,Well I take meds for bipolar and ritalin and I think I am addicted to weed.
10254,He comes from an immigrant family that doesn't really believe in/ trust in medicine so he's trying hard to understand but it's completely against the beliefs he was brought up with.
10255,I havent had a lot of luck with anti-depressant meds and even benzos to calm me down.
10256,"At any rate, my fiance will freak that I'm on such heavy meds, and I don't know how to talk to him about it."
10257,"As I have mentioned before, I am currently [off my medication](http://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/19z9t6/wanted_to_share_in_case_anyone_is_in_the_same/) and have been for months."
10258,"Anyway, because of this, I have recently noticed that I feel, for the first time since being off my medication, that my emotions/reactions are ""situationally appropriate""."
10259,"It seemed to calm down, i didnt even need meds or anything, and then i was fine."
10260,"My story isn't glamorous or clean 

I am not preaching against the medications that save us day to day  

I just am asking who do we become 

when the saving has been done?"
10261,Hi everyone I was just officially diagnosed a few weeks ago and I'm starting new meds.
10262,I want to know what has helped you reduce bipolar symptoms besides medication.
10263,"I know the routine, try try try meds until you find the right one and dosage."
10264,"So I am wondering, what are some good sleep meds?"
10265,"At the beginning of this year, he was diagnosed with BPII and is now on medication/in therapy."
10266,"I have been told by doctors before, ""You are not bipolar, if you were bipolar on these medicines you would be very high manic and you can barely get out of bed."""
10267,Are what always reminds me to take my medication.
10268,I'm on5 fucking medications.
10269,"I don't have a problem taking meds for the rest of my life if I seriously need them, but want to try mindfulness first."
10270,I've been off meds for 2 months.
10271,"It could just be stress, so I don't want to put undue emphasis on the meds if it's just me overworking myself."
10272,I am going to be speaking with a psychiatrist on Wednesday to discuss my medication options.
10273,"That all being said, **how much of a change can I expect with medication?"
10274,"I'm really hoping that the medication just knocks them out entirely, but even if the medication just makes them easier to deal with, that'd be a miracle for me."
10275,I have been on meds a few times but never long enough to refill the bottle.
10276,A few question in regards to meds and just general feelings?
10277,I have read that many places that long term use of meds waters down your personality?
10278,"They thought I had Chronic Lyme, Fibro, and who knows what else, but no diagnosis fit, and all the meds they gave me were horrible."
10279,"Just gotta keep busy, stay on the meds, try to stay sober, and avoid self injuring."
10280,"Brain no longer acknowledges that night time + meds = shutdown time
3."
10281,Do your meds just...stop?
10282,"Just wanted to say, I FINALLY took the step to try medication."
10283,"Talking to friends who have started medication, and reading things on here for so long has finally given me the confidence to get over my fear of medication and give it a try."
10284,"I was diagnosed with anxiety-based bipolar disorder about a year ago, after the depression medications they tried putting me on just made things worse."
10285,"About two or three months ago, I decided that I didn't want to be dependent on medication, so I slowly took myself off of it."
10286,"So now medication probably isn't an option, either."
10287,"Four or five days later and I experience a massive backlash of depression, the way I do when I go off my meds completely."
10288,"Honestly, I don't know why I was sent to rehab or what I was supposed to accomplish there other than taking my meds and twiddling my thumbs."
10289,We have been trying to adjust my meds  to try and alleviate some of the rapid swings.
10290,"The meds only do so much, they aren't the be all end all solution, they are a components."
10291,Have a doc apt tomorrow to check up on me and the meds.
10292,I was diagnosed with bipolar II when I was about 15 years old and found a mixture of medications that properly worked for me pretty soon after.
10293,"I'm 21 now, and although medication has made my life a lot easier, I feel like it was 'fixed' so early on in my life that I don't really understand my condition as well as I'd like."
10294,"I've been thinking, and please hear me out, that if I were to stop taking my medication for a month or so, I'd now be able to look at what happens as a result in an objective way, and that I'd be able to make the decision to get back on my meds if/when things got too crazy."
10295,"The difference I'm seeing between myself and those who simply don't want to take their medication is that I'm well aware of how much better I feel when I'm on them, I just want to understand myself better."
10296,3) Is the medicine worth the loss of the positives and does it make me a robot?
10297,"Around September of last year I stopped taking my medication because I was having self-harm type violent impulses, though never anything so strong that I would carry them out."
10298,"I only wanted to feel that euphoric high of mania again before I went back on the meds, but things started to destabilize and the deep depression came back before the full on mania (if only cocaine were legal and not dangerous/addictive...) So I went back on my medication and everything seemed to be going well."
10299,In early November I resumed my medication and everything was going as expected.
10300,What I would like to know is whether this is something that can be managed without medication?
10301,I like having the energy on the other end of the scale and don't want to lose that by taking medication.
10302,"I've got my meds adjusted (plus two more added, yay), but that wasn't all."
10303,"There aren't a million thoughts in my head anymore, no more rage and I don't feel numb or foggy, like any other medicine I've tried in the past."
10304,"I'm 90% sure this happened prior to this, but the earliest I can remember this happening is when I took Effexor, which was by far the worst medication I ever took."
10305,"I'm about to up my dosage, since my meds mysteriously stopped working."
10306,I currently get generic trileptal (oxcarbazepine) filled at walmart and might be adding  does anybody know of a program or store or anything I could try to help with the cost of medication?
10307,"I'm going on anti-anxiety medication, perhaps I wont have to self-medicate with alcohol anymore, and I'll finally be able to smoke weed again without turning into a wobbly mess."
10308,"My meds are inadequate for dealing with something
like this."
10309,"I hate that I got myself balls deep in drugs/alcohol to self medicate for years because I wasn't diagnosed/didn't want to accept my diagnosis/went off my meds, etc."
10310,I hate my Dad asking if I'm off my medication whenever I'm angry or upset.
10311,"Ive taken every medication under the sun, lithium, depakote, seroquel, xanax, abilify, klonopin, lamictal, risperdal,and I cant even remember the rest ive taken."
10312,"I dont recommend people get off their meds, please dont think this is what the story is about."
10313,"even if i do pull through, lets say the meds started evening out."
10314,Am I building up a tolerance to the medication?
10315,"I'm not confident in the diagnoses, the medication, or if I should be on medication at all."
10316,It's true that a lot of bipolar people struggle with drug addiction (because it's a lot easier to self medicate to manage symptoms than go through years of trial and error with meds that often have horrible side effects and) and it's true that we're a wee bit more prone to suicide than the average joe.
10317,"""Only sick people take medicine, and I feel better, so I don't need my medicine"" is complete bull shit."
10318,"I've gone off meds more times than I care to remember, and have gone back to them out of desperation each and every time."
10319,"What I learned from these experiences was that I was on the wrong meds each of those times, not that I didn't need the medication."
10320,If you're thinking about going off of your medications PLEASE talk to your doctor and do it safely.
10321,"Once I got on the right meds I started realizing that I could trust my decisions when I was ""middle ground"" and that it was ok to wait until middle ground came back to me before making big choices."
10322,"I've gone through just about every combination of meds imaginable to little or no effect, and earlier this year had a devastating round of ECT treatments that my next-to-last pdoc said was pretty much my last-ditch effort at finding something effective."
10323,"I get the whole ""one step at a time"" thing, but I don't get how to face such a monumental task as changing *everything*, or even to what extent I have the power to make these changes, if there are just aspects of this that I have to deal with until I find the meds or treatments that work best."
10324,"Currently I’m not taking any medication, but I'm also sober -- which is very new to me -- drinking was a big part of my days."
10325,"I've heard a lot of things about various meds, and I'm not sure I want to throw that in the mix right now, but I’m open to advice."
10326,"(Somewhat applies to weed as well) When I take moderate amounts, enough to feel the effects but not enough to be completely drunk, I feel substantially *more sober* than when I'm not under the influence of anything (except my meds)."
10327,"I can't just take a pill every time I feel like this, I'm already on so many meds."
10328,"I eat fast food daily (sometimes twice), rarely take my pills (I am on four medications- two anti-depressants, a mood stabilizer and an anxiety med), stopped exercising (though this was mostly over almost a year ago now), and I am too scared to pick up another job."
10329,"**TL;DR**:  Over the past year, I gained weight, lost my job, had serious relationship problems, stopped taking my meds and had problems with roommates."
10330,How can I provide children to the man I love when going off meds might make me go postal and I don't even know if I want to pass on my genetics?
10331,He's read up on medication and the symptoms of it and all.
10332,I think I want to go on strong medication to where I don't feel anything.
10333,And a medication to help me be more active and sociable.
10334,":/ Pdoc says Lithium helps develop better cognitive function and treats depression, however I've read elsewhere that Lamictal and other meds are better at treating mixed episodes."
10335,"Even the [Black Dog Institute](http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au/healthprofessionals/bipolardisorder/managingbipolardisorder/medicationsinbipolardisorder.cfm) states Lamictal is best for bipolar depression, which is my main issue."
10336,I was able to get an appointment within a month after being told it was a 6-9 month wait and was on meds after the first meeting.
10337,"Side note: I'm not a ""give meds"" kind of nurse, my pts aren't in danger from the fog I'm describing."
10338,They used the threat of real meds to scare me away.
10339,"Once I reached the 150mg dose I have stayed there and found it to be the only medication to ever help my mood swings, depression, and anxiety."
10340,Making me very excited as I've been trying many medications over the past 5 years with very little help.
10341,"I am a little worried about memory loss, but my Dr said that my memory loss could be due to different factors like medications that I take, or brain damage due to multiple severe manic episodes."
10342,I'm just wondering is anyone else has experience with this medication and either having both bipolar/ ADHD or being misdiagnosed with bipolar to find out they have ADHD instead.
10343,Little history about why I stopped taking my meds to begin with: I've had issues with chronic nausea because of my gallbladder for years.
10344,It got so bad that I couldn't take my meds anymore because I was too sick.
10345,After having my gallbladder out a couple of weeks ago I started taking my meds again (after about a week so I can confirm no nausea).
10346,when i started them again i found that the gallbladder nausea was masking nausea from my medication (viibryd- an antidepressant) So I stopped all meds until I could see my pedoc which was today.
10347,I posted here a bit back saying that I was feeling pretty good off my meds and I knew i needed to go back on them but didn't feel like it.
10348,You convinced me that I really needed to get back to my meds.
10349,"(which was when I found out they made me sick)

anyway, I went in today and let her know that, since being off my meds, I was pretty okay as long as nothing in my life went wrong."
10350,"Her response was that it wasn't the bipolar, it was just stress, and that I didn't need to go back on meds since I was doing so well."
10351,I did convince her to put me back on meds (abilify and prozac now) and there's no point in finding someone else because she's leaving the practice before even my next appointment.
10352,But I trusted her and the fact that she even thought that a bipolar person would be okay long term without meds shocked me and really upset me.
10353,That kind of dismissal of the severity of bipolar and the statistics of people on vs off meds can kill someone.
10354,I was on medication for almost two years and it never stopped the depression.
10355,"I've been off my meds for about a month now, the same amount of time I've been back at school."
10356,I know he'll blame my feelings right now on not taking my meds when in reality I felt like this over half the time I was on meds.
10357,How long have you been stable on the same meds?
10358,"I have been trying for 15 years to get my meds right, and I'm still not there."
10359,I'm still switching up my meds to try and get it right.
10360,"Worried about my schedule, over several months I began to wean myself off the meds (with the help of my psychiatrist), and I am currently on:


(1) 4 mg Seroquel (25 mg split into 6, which is not easy)

(2) .25 mg Clonazepam

[(3) 20 mg Latuda]

[(4) 100 mg Luvox (fluvoxamine)]


Even with the way reduced dosage of the Seroquel and Clonazepam, I can still easily (and in my sleepy stupor, prefer to) sleep for like 12-14 hours a day."
10361,"My doctor says it's due to an interaction with the two meds that heightens their efficacy, and that I am probably uniquely susceptible to Seroquel (I know people are on like 200 mg, much less my 4 mg, and their sleep problems are understandable, but *mine*?)."
10362,"I mean, its a med for both disorders.. but it has to be one of the most frightening meds I've ever been offered."
10363,"I know she is on medication, but I don't know what kind (all I know is it makes her feel like a zombie and she is constantly sleeping)."
10364,My medication has made me numb.
10365,I would stop taking the medication if it weren’t for the fact that I would have RAPID cycles.
10366,My medications are well-adjusted and I've been taking them as directed.
10367,"Did you learn more about yourself and your moods, and did you go back on your meds, or did you find you could cope ok without them?"
10368,Like many of us here I went straight from diagnosis to medication and am tempted to take a few months off because I want to know what my moods are really like without them.
10369,"Why can everyone get anxiety meds but when I really need them, no?"
10370,Dragging myself out of bed was really hard because of side effects of the medication when I was going to a physical university.
10371,I didn't start all this stuff until I got sober and started taking meds so I feel like maybe just having a healthier mind brought me to do this.
10372,Can they potentially not hire me because I take a prescribed medication?
10373,"Since then it's already been a fun ol' time dealing with medications (I've tried 16 since the initial diagnosis) and the mood swings and everything else, as you can imagine."
10374,Five years ago I decided I should resume therapy and then two years later decided to get on meds.
10375,I've tried about a dozen different meds and combos and finally gave up medication back in May 09 when I came down with Steven Johnson Syndrome from Lamictal.
10376,"I went through the 'i'm ok, i don't need meds' bit a few times in the years past but now I know better."
10377,I've been on my meds like 3 months Lithium 300 mg once in morning twice at night for a total of 900mg.
10378,"This is hugely exciting for me and my family, but we do have some concerns about medications and potential manic/depressive episodes."
10379,":-)

So here are my questions: What are some traveling tips you know that help, in terms of keeping your meds together &amp; not stolen, keeping a stable mind, and not obsessively worrying that something is going to get fucked up?"
10380,And how did you account for the time change with time sensitive meds?
10381,Been testing medication and currently having quite the manic episode.
10382,I've been taking my regular meds.
10383,I have been on medication for several years and in therapy.
10384,"&gt;She had trials of ....

&gt;**Lithium** - used to treat the manic episodes of manic depression

&gt;**BuSpar** - anxiolytic psychotropic drug primarily used to treat GAD

&gt;**Trazodone** -  tetracyclic antidepressant

&gt; **Sertraline** - ssri antidepressant 

&gt;**Clonazepam** - benzodiazepine for treatment of panic

&gt;**Melatonin** - sleep aid

&gt;**Olanzapine** - atypical antipsychotic for treatment of bipolar

&gt; **Seroquel** - atypical antipsychotic for treatment of bipolar

&gt;All these medications were tried and discontinued due to side effects or lack of benefit."
10385,Her discharge medications were **Sertraline 150 mg** daily and **Olanzapine 5 mg** at bedtime.
10386,Is it common to not get any benefit out of psychiatric medications?
10387,"also if I decline with my mental health again, could I refer to these medications in order to try again since I have previously taken them?"
10388,He sat with me while I adjusted to new medications.
10389,"Currently, I am switching medication, weaning off of Lamictal and on to Strattera."
10390,Is how long I haven't misuse any prescription medications!
10391,"I take other meds in the morning to help control my bipolar disorder (though they don't really help, working on finding something that works..) My up and down swings are intense and last weeks at a time."
10392,"Not as if I now feel balanced and will stop taking my meds, but not sure of... anything about it except for the psychosis."
10393,I started with a team of my psychologist and psychiatrist to reduce my medication for the goal of pregnancy.
10394,Again I was doing really good coming down but it was scary to stop medication I've been for almost ten years.
10395,"My doctor wanted me to stay on it for a while, to prevent any major relapse, since we've taken most of my meds off already."
10396,"As a surprise side affect of coming off meds, I've lost 15kg."
10397,I have a serious mental disorder and now no meds.
10398,"I've been on meds for 9 months, and we've finally found a combo that works, so I can always restart them and get ""normal"" again."
10399,"I want to stop I was diagnosed and immediately put on meds, without any time to get to know myself as someone with bipolar disorder."
10400,Maybe the disorder isn't out of my control-- I made it 24 years without meds.
10401,I've wanted to stop taking my meds since the very start.
10402,But I have the intense need to get to know my unmedicated self so I know why I even need the meds.
10403,I feel like I'm fighting against the meds with all my might because I don't know how they're inhibiting my true self.
10404,He DOESN'T take medication for it as far as I know and uses his weed smoking as an excuse saying it helps him.
10405,I have been on meds regularly this whole time span.
10406,"I have been riding a meds roller coaster for so long, and on top of that I am trying to hold my life together when the meds don't work."
10407,My best friend was diagnosed with bipolar type II at the beginning of this year and is in treatment (meds + therapy).
10408,And I refuse to take psychotropic medication.
10409,"All of these medicines also only attenuate certain psychotic symptoms, to the best of my knowledge."
10410,"I don't know if it's because my medication was switched on me, but I just don't feel anything right now."
10411,But what do I do when my stability is threatened by the constant feeling that I'm getting dumber with each day that passes because of medication?
10412,She is supposed to start medication next week and has started therapy already - Im scared she will never forgive us for what we did..
10413,DAE have a problem like this and found a solution or alternate medication?
10414,"When I get home and have access to my medication again I'll probably try overdosing on all my Valproic acid and also clonazepam, maybe take all my seroquel too just to make sure it does the job."
10415,Will overdosing on bipolar medication kill me?
10416,"It's stupid, I know, but sometimes I look back at my mental state in my early 20s and how it wasn't so bad and how I didn't need meds then."
10417,"Now, in my early 30s, I need a cocktail of meds to keep me functional."
10418,Has anyone thought of going off their meds as an experiment to see what would happen?
10419,"I don't think I'm cured or nothing, you know, but I kinda want to see what would happen if I gradually stopped taking meds under my pdoc's supervision and went med-free for awhile."
10420,"Eventually I was prescribed a medication by my doctor to help with my twitches (which she didn't think we're causes by a psychological illness because I often didn't realize I was doing them which means they were ""involuntary"")."
10421,I stopped taking the medication about a year ago because they made me gain weight and I became very unhappy with my body and developed unhealthy eating habits.
10422,They left some refills for my meds.
10423,I do not think my meds are right.
10424,"I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on Thursday to adjust my meds (750 mg of Depakote) but in the interim, I still have to work and try and get by."
10425,I've read up interactions with the plethora of the other meds I'm on and I'm ok in that there shouldn't be any bad ones.
10426,Is this a medication issue or just a behavioral issue of feeling like blah all the time?
10427,I am taking medication and that doesn't seem to be helping although I have tried many.
10428,"Its been 3 days that I've gone without medication, and i had an episode yesterday where i felt like killing myself and disappearing for no apparent reason."
10429,"Hi,

My sister has been diagnosed bipolar/schizophrenic 10+ years ago, has struggled with substance abuse her whole life, and has been on all kinds of medications."
10430,"Currently she is off meds, is self medicating with what/and however she feels."
10431,"Question 1: 
Am I the only person out there taking a seriously godawful amount of meds, or is there a small percentage of the community dealing with it too?"
10432,I visit a couple of different places regarding bipolar and it always seems like everyone else is getting along just fine on one or two medications and having a normal stable life.
10433,"Which leads directly in Question 2:

Question 2: 
Does anyone else get seriously constipated because of the meds they're on?"
10434,I only go #2 like twice a week and I'm pretty sure it's because of the meds.
10435,"That being said, In the last month i've/they've changed  5 medications, i've been in a constant mixed state for almost 4 weeks now; and I've told the psychiatrist this, and I'm pretty sure it's due to med changes."
10436,I hoped that medicine or therapy would make these things disappear.
10437,"After experimenting with medication,  my final decision was to go without."
10438,"The only explanation that I could give to a doctor was that I either had an allergic reaction to my medication, it took away my perception of emotion completely, or that it made me depressed."
10439,"Has anyone else experienced these, or any other scary reactions to medication like these, that have made them have to make a drastic (it felt drastic) choice like me?"
10440,"Since I am off therapy and constantly experimenting with different medication, how is your sex life normally, how does medication affect your sex life, could therapy actually alter this part of your life?"
10441,"I know eight hours isn't enough and if I stay up later than 9 no matter how much I sleep in I am still tired the whole day though I usually wake up the same time monday through friday and then sat and sun.....

Is it the medicine that makes me tired like that or am I not getting enough quality sleep?"
10442,"He said I am in an agitated manic state, discontinuing my vyvanse, and adding a medicine that is used to treat agitation and schizophrenia."
10443,While I'm working with the pdoc on getting my meds worked out -fing lamictal gave me scary blisters on my tongue - does anyone have advice on managing the highs and lows sans medication?
10444,"Also, is there any hope that I won't have to take meds the rest of my life?"
10445,Finally started taking meds on a daily basis from April 2012.
10446,I went off the meds at the end of October.
10447,Was never happy with meds.
10448,But I don't think I can cope without medication either.
10449,"Not that medication ever really helped me, truly."
10450,"Also wanted to ask, has anyone else managed symptoms without medication?"
10451,We're all craving dopamine and serotonin whether through psych meds or street drugs because of chemical imbalances.
10452,"Because as much as you love them, that is how much they love you, and there is some part of them that not only does not want to do such thing to you but does not want you to ever see what it is like beyond the modified lifestyle, the medication, and the noggin."
10453,"I have an appointment next week and I will discuss it with my doctor then, but for now I promised to keep taking my meds even though I really want to stop."
10454,"After hospitalization, a year of therapy, and tons of different meds I am no longer rapid cycling."
10455,I've been through a lot of medication switches.
10456,That there are lots of other ways to deal and that any positive effects that the medications will have are placebo effects and are only working to kill your brain cells.
10457,He says that he understands this stuff a bit more because he knows more mentally ill people that I will ever know and I shouldn't just give up to take medication.
10458,"Another one bites the dust I guess,  I'm getting exhausted from all the meds."
10459,"I've been avoiding medication at pretty much all costs, but have tried them from time to time."
10460,"Reading some of all of your posts it seems dismal, ""Took my 5 years to get my meds right"", ""Wow, It's been 10 years and my meds still aren't right!"""
10461,"The prospect of taking an anti-psychotic, a mood stabilizer, anxiety meds, sleeping pills, it just seems absurd to me."
10462,"I've been kind of holding out on meds, I've read enough about calcification of seratonin receptors, negative impacts of extended use, even outright brain damage caused by a lot of these medicines."
10463,As much as I enjoy my life on meds...and am amazed at how sane i can be...i had that one day where i am fully without them and my boss could tell at work...he pulled me to the side and said that i lack focus and insinuated i was on drugs...Nooooo mutherfucker im OFF drugs...actually i just responded that i understood and thanked him but i did notice the implied drug reference....maybe i should just come out and admit im an artist...maybe thats the problem
10464,I took my medicine and all but I didn't really believe it.
10465,It took a few days to be Sara again and adding my meds slowly back.
10466,Today I can safely say I am Sara again and am officially back on all my meds except my sleeping pills.
10467,I feel fine today except a little nausea from my ADHD medicine.
10468,"Wishing I was dead (not suicidal, except in a handful of cases when I had a reaction to new medications)
8."
10469,I don't have the energy to eat or go outside or take my meds.
10470,I think my meds need adjusted yet the professionals think more therapy is needed.
10471,She then asked if I wanted to go to the hospital that way they can give me medication instead of waiting for psychiatrist.
10472,"The problem is that I'm really afraid to take medication, but she's pushing me too."
10473,Therapist is calling tomorrow to either make an appointment with a psychiatrist for me or check me into the hospital for suicidal ideations and medications.
10474,I used to hate medication.
10475,"She also has generally been contentious with her parents,  but it really blew up recently, because her parents did not agree with the dripping the meds and they fought over it and have not talked in weeks."
10476,"I was prescribed medication (Lamictal), but I've only just a few months ago started using it."
10477,"I thought that this medicine was supposed to help these things, but all that I've felt is a decrease in aggression, not a decrease in depression."
10478,"So I just said ""Oh... Is she taking medication for it?"""
10479,"If this lasts, I don't want to take any meds anymore at all."
10480,I'm on meds but when I'm really stressed it comes out.
10481,"this medicine call Trazodone (Desyrel), I am on 25mg."
10482,Have any one every taken this medication and if so what are your experience with it.
10483,I was diagnosed as Bipolar II at the age of 20 after dealing with a lot of depressive episodes and a lot of different medications that didn't work.
10484,"Last night I didn't get to take any, I ran out, I have new insurance and some kind of odd way of getting my medicine (trying to learn all this stuff still too, I just found out I was bipolar at the beginning of this year.)"
10485,"I see my doctor Friday and I'm going to try to get my medicine tomorrow if I can, but what will happen if I'm not able to?"
10486,"My mental health has been deteriorating lately, I'm currently taking 150mg of venlafaxine daily but I know it isn't enough or the right medicine, and I simply can't afford to go to the doctor and get things figured out."
10487,I forgot to take my medicine yesterday.
10488,I take my meds regularly and I don't forget it very often.
10489,"So I thought I found a good doctor but some stuff is weird...she doesn't think I'm really bipolar II (despite 3 previous doctors who do think I have it) because I don't display enough hypomania (....which is...because I'm medicated and I sleep okay...), and most notably she puts me on new doses of meds and leaves me high and dry for 3 weeks with no reliable way to contact her."
10490,I haven't been on meds for a few months.
10491,"My meds make me focus, awake, able to go from day to day."
10492,"And if I screw that up because I chose not to be on meds again, I let it win."
10493,She told me this afternoon that she was afraid she had left too early and that her meds were not controlling her symptoms.
10494,"My meds are stable, I'm stable (well, for the most part, even the best of us have down days) enough for him to consider me low risk and I'm moving on with life."
10495,I haven't taken my meds regularly since before the summer.
10496,"I will be taken off the celexa when I see my Pysch on Monday, what other medicine do you suggest to replace the celexa."
10497,"It's 10 am and I've taken the meds i'm supposed to, and then some diazepam to try and calm down and think straight but it's not working."
10498,"My bf and I have a very healthy relationship and although he's bipolar he takes his meds and such so he's relatively ""normal""."
10499,I'm not a stranger to medication side effects.
10500,"However, I feel like my personality has changed but I can't tell if it's actually medication induced or it's just the illness."
10501,I feel like God or something used to give me ideas and now he can't because of the medication.
10502,"I've heard a lot of anecdotes about how people have lost their creativity on medication, Lamictal especially."
10503,"But I wanted to hear more thoughts on creativity,  especially if you've had success with other medications or anything else about beeping creative."
10504,"She saw her doctor recently and was properly diagnosed, but the dr wont touch her meds because of her drinking."
10505,My girlfriend recently stopped taking her meds because she thinks she'll be fine without them after being well for about two months.
10506,"I don't understand why my mom wants me to not take my medicine anymore, when I'm at my best."
10507,I take my medication everyday(almost).
10508,I want to be able to live without weed but I feel like the alternatives are meds that I won't stick to or hospitalization.
10509,Just a FYI - I am on meds.
10510,So I don't think the meds are making this worse?
10511,I am currently going through a medication change.
10512,"Recently my doctors began to question if I need the other medications (other than Lithium) at all, and would I be willing to try reducing down and into monotherapy."
10513,i am wigging the fuck out- i am on a manic right now so if i take my anti anxiety meds i will lose that energy that i love.
10514,"Now, about a year after starting counseling and medications I feel stable."
10515,"Now, with medication it's like I only have one of those gears."
10516,"**tl;dr** on medication making me stable, but feeling stable makes me less motivated to achieve"
10517,"I know he's afraid of admitting he can't just ""deal with it himself"" and doesn't want to be on medication, I keep trying to tell him he needs to talk to someone to see his options."
10518,"Just curious, I know it's not about the number of meds but how those meds work with your body that's important."
10519,My psychiatrist and therapist both agreed that I was experiencing a mild hypomanic episode and decided to put me on some medication.
10520,I feel like I can successfully stop taking this medication and live a normal life.
10521,I believe I can use my coping strategies instead of resorting to medication.
10522,My doctors tell me to stick with my medication (as any shrink will tell ya) and so does my family.
10523,I want to try to live without medication but I'm worried that it might be a bad idea.
10524,"Then we talked meds, which further confirmed everything - she had  upped my Cymbalta dosage 5 weeks ago to combat my depression/anxiety - it hadnt worked."
10525,So... now i get to switch over 2 medications at once... Har.
10526,"If anyone has any tips for managing the change over in medication, or getting started on making the most of learning how to manage this disorder via therapy, I am all ears."
10527,I want to look at changing my meds some but since I moved I can't find a psychiatrist.
10528,I saw a doctor here who is willing to take over my medication management until I can find a psychiatrist.
10529,"My medication seems to be working, though with one major side effect: sexual dysfunction."
10530,I had to not get my meds refilled and am starting to feel the effects.
10531,I'm 23 and I've been diagnosed with depression for a while now and have been keeping it well under control with meds for around 8 months.
10532,"I've been taking my meds religiously (lithium, bupropion, quetiapine)."
10533,The rest of the time I just feel numb or very tired depending on the meds.
10534,My meds were altered slightly.
10535,"In 6 years, I have been on more medications than I can name, always with an adverse reaction."
10536,I tell him how I didn't tell my parents about the meds and how they flipped out when they found out.
10537,I had already told him how unsupportive they had been with me before and how that was the same reason I didn't tell them when I was prescribed the meds.
10538,"Hell, you don't want to fuck with any BP person that doesn't have their meds figured out."
10539,I'm tired of shitty medications with even shittier side effects.
10540,"I wish desperately that there was something I could do - positive thinking, more exercise, a different medication."
10541,"From being hospitalized 4 different times, being in and off meds half of my life for 14+ years, to constantly having nothing in life and repeatedly falling down."
10542,"I've tried all the meds at one time or another, it's just not for me."
10543,"And it's sad to think the only way to get better is to be on medication, but for some of us it actually makes us worse, if that makes sense at all."
10544,I think most of us consider that hey well at least beign on meds is better because then I won't kill myself etc..
10545,I think that's the most common logic for staying on medication.
10546,Now I feel I would rather kill myself than be on meds to be honest.
10547,"Or maybe just no meds work for me, because they don't."
10548,"Anyways that's not why I'm making this post, maybe it's because I feel one of you stupid fucks is going to mention to stay on meds etc blah blah, which is true."
10549,I am curious about what dosages others were taking of their medication(s) and how long it took to find?
10550,"Also, other medications (and dosages if you want) if you take any are helpful to the discussion, I believe."
10551,He decided to essentially restart my medications with more frequent visits to check the effectiveness during this time period to try to pinpoint optimal combinations/dosages.
10552,"We are still working to fine tune right now, but hopefully after 3.5 years of different medications/combinations/dosages I can find something that works to keep me stable(-ish) and still feeling like a human being (unlike the zombielike symptoms previously felt at times)."
10553,"Side note:
Through all this it has been tough to keep the mentality that medication was necessary and helpful in concurrence with building life skills for coping."
10554,"Rather than just implementing the skills learned over years of alternating highs and lows, with minimal medicinal assistance, without any medicine at all."
10555,Any other medications?
10556,"(Only if you feel comfortable saying so, of course) I am curious because  I have been trying for 3.5 years to find the right medications/combinations/dosages after trying several without significant improvements."
10557,I haven't really been keeping on my medication.
10558,"after years of struggling with her prescribing me medication, she made the comment that i may not be bipolar and she might have misdiagnosed me."
10559,I'm not a fan of anti anxiety meds or meds in general.
10560,I'm particularly med sensitive and meds at very low dosages can give me loads of side effects.
10561,Any ideas how to bury the anxiety without meds or similar experiences?
10562,But when I go tomorrow they will have me see someone tomorrow to adjust my meds.
10563,"Hi, I need advice on how to properly deal with theses hypersexual urges even while on meds."
10564,Some of it is the medicines.
10565,My medication was recently adjusted but I'm having some serious side effects and I have to wait until tomorrow to talk with my doc.
10566,I couldn't make the connection that these may be occuring due to my cutting back on my medications + stress.
10567,Also any other redditors with bipolar drink while on meds?
10568,The good news is my medication is starting to work.
10569,"But the more I read this forum and others, the more I realize how odd it is to be on one medication and it makes me think I might need something more or something else altogether."
10570,How can I tell if this is just the onset of another hypomanic year OR if this is just me HAPPY with a little help from my meds?
10571,"But mainly in that post, I say how I go through cycles of depression, when I get put on medication then when it really starts working how it should I start thinking hey, i'm not depressed anymore why do I need to take meds and take myself off of them and then puts my into these downward spirals till I hit bottom."
10572,At 19 I got diagnosed bipolar and have been on and off medications for 6 years.
10573,I finally met someone who helped motivate me and encouraged me to go to a therapy program and try medications again.
10574,"But even after all the meds I take, all the docs I've seen, exercise, hobbies, and all the other stuff I do to improve my life, this is always in the back of my mind."
10575,I need to get on meds and stop this so I can get a job that I won't screw up.
10576,"I take my meds regularly and most of the time I'm ok, and by ok I mean that I'm not down, but I'm not all that up either."
10577,Today u went to the Doctor prescribed me this medication.
10578,"I'm a little considered about the sexual side effects, I just wanted to know if this was a common occurrence with this medication."
10579,"Sure, I was taking the meds (very low dose), and was/am going bi-weekly to a very nice psychologist, but in the back of my mind I *knew* this wasn't a real thing."
10580,"I have a tendency, and it comes up every time I'm stable for more than about 6 months, to start feeling like I don't need to keep taking my medications."
10581,I've struggled with it every since I was diagnosed ten years ago and you'd think I would learn by now that going off of my meds always ends in relapse.
10582,"I've read that thinking you can go off of your medication is a symptom of the illness itself, and maybe that's just what it is, but I wanted to hear if anyone else gets this way when they're feeling stable for an extended period of time."
10583,"It manifests mostly as rationalizations for why I had my last episode, and if I could just avoid those triggers in the future then I won't have to rely on medications."
10584,I was on and off meds in the beginning so some were because of that.
10585,I know medication would help but I am currently not under the care of a doctor and I can't do anything about it.
10586,"With the exception of one long trauma-induced period in my teens, I've gotten by most of my life with either no medication or else occasional treatment for particularly troubling bouts of depression and/or anxiety."
10587,"1. at first i was worried that my meds would effect my creativity but then i remembered that i managed to write songs, learn the guitar very quickly while on meds."
10588,"my thing was that i wanted to speed up my process of getting off meds, but i may have to wait still getting used to having emotions now that i'm off my antidepressant (its pretty tough not feeling numb)

2. can you be medicated, by that i mean i guess not OVERLY zombified, and date?"
10589,Tuesday I'll meet with the doctor who will prescribe my first meds ever.
10590,He was refusing meds up until I went to go see him in person and convinced him that he wasn't going to die if he took them.
10591,"I have been very sensitive and gentle, loving and encouraging to work in therapy, take meds, etc."
10592,"my boyfriend and I lived together when I found out, I've been trying to set up an appt to change my meds, but I've been having trouble finding anyone I can bus to that will a) take my insurance and b) is seeing new patients that isn't scheduled over a month out."
10593,"I read a lot of posts from people who have a recent diagnosis and by best advice is don't be afraid to question your doctor, don't be afraid to switch doctors and meds, don't be afraid to be honest about drug and alcohol usage."
10594,my cocktail of medicine faded from its painful side effects to feeling the real me come out from hiding for so many years.
10595,"of course don't stop taking meds if you're on them

this was taken down from /bipolarreddit/ for some reason, though it has peer reviewed studies, and there are even more if you search."
10596,"I was diagnosed bipolar II six years ago, I stopped taking medication three years ago after trying almost a dozen different prescriptions with no long term successes and horrible side effects."
10597,"He's said things like ""I bet you don't even need the meds"" and ""intelligent people don't have mental illnesses"" in response to my diagnosis of Bipolar 1."
10598,"My meds make me extremely lazy, take away all my energy, keep me in a constant state of confusion, and have diminished my sex drive to the point where I might as well be asexual."
10599,I think returning to college in the Fall will help with that and hopefully I can get on some meds that help me rather than hurt.
10600,He was doing well until the doctors switched his meds (to avoid some side effects) and he had another episode.
10601,I still haven't been taking my medication and my live in loverboy claims it's the mania and that I will inevitably crash and burn because he's seen it happen many times before.
10602,"I'm no longer in a dark place and that's great :)

(thought: maybe food is medicine?)"
10603,Since I stopped taking my meds and started eating great foods and exercising my libido is back.

10605,"I'm glad I know my ""crazy"" tells after all this time, but I need to get new meds/see someone before I do something really stupid."
10606,I skipped my meds to drink one night and forgot them the next.
10607,After my last outburst I promised to see a psychiatrist and complete a year of therapy and medication.
10608,"I'm in a depressive state at the time and I'm not on any meds right now but i notice something during this week because I'm self-analysing and writing down my mood swings this whole week for some strange reason,,, anyway i notice I'm feeling depressed for an hour or two then i slowly starting to feel normal for an hour or two,  suddenly I'm on top of the world for five minutes and then my energy sucks out of my body and i want to be alone or go to sleep,, this goes on all day?"
10609,"fuck, I'm going back on meds reel soon,, does anyone knows if this is ""normal"" or what you call it..."
10610,"She has recently said she is only trying to get her GED and get a job, but even then , she makes little effort to make her appointments, she doesn't try to keep up with taking the medications she is currently on."
10611,"I don't know if it's the fact that I am still coming down/recovering from a recent manic episode, or the meds or what."
10612,"I have been on tons of different medications, am currently doing CBT therapy, and most recently, have switched my diet."
10613,"As soon as my meds are all sorted out, I'm finding a new pdoc."
10614,She has become dead set on getting an ADHD diagnoses and medication.
10615,"My meds were switched up (more lamictal and started lithium), but the group therapy and talking with the staff is what really helped me."
10616,I've been thinking about just cutting off my medication and letting my inner self run free.
10617,It's like my Bipolar disorder will try to talk me out of taking my medication so that it can ruin my life.
10618,My  boyfriend(21)went off his meds and I think he's having a psychotic break.
10619,"Most of the people close to me know I'm bipolar, and I'm consistent with my medication and seeing doctors."
10620,"Fast-forward a few years and I'm doing ok, I seem to have stabilized considerably, having explored many different combinations of medications, supplements, diet, employment/unemployment, exercise and other lifestyle changes I'm down to just tweaking the parameters a little but have found a good base and I'm pressing forward."
10621,"I just got out of intensive outpatient treatment, where I spent a lot of time (get this) coloring with crayons and resisting medication."
10622,I'm opening up to the possibility of taking meds (SSRIs and/or mood stabilizers).
10623,"I am a recently diagnosed bipolar and my doctor told me to do some research on the following medications: 
lamictal
neurontin
depakote
topamax
tegretol
trileptal

any thoughts?"
10624,"I had 3 terrible reactions from 3 different medications., including restlessness, involuntary muscle contractions, feeling like I wanted to crawl out of my skin, hallucinations and loss of motor control."
10625,"They were furious when I even suggested trying another medication, and I will not bring it up again."
10626,"Another part of anxiety was the time difference, both for medication timing and for ""triggering"" an episode."
10627,"I am not familiar with their medication, but I don't think it is too time sensitive, as long as it is regular."
10628,"More recently, she has gone off one of her meds which, in short, has given her more feeling."
10629,I have extreme anger/depression and have been on different meds for some time.
10630,"Now it's always ""are you taking your meds?"""
10631,"I just don't know what to do anymore, so I am now seeking a new doctor who is actually willing to try a different medication route."
10632,"All of this aside...I guess I'm a little nervous about my GP prescribing me pills because though I've had a bad history in the past with pdocs, I wonder if relying on my GP to pick the best meds for me OR me telling him what I want to try is a good idea or not."
10633,I've spent years with that sick fear in my gut that taking meds would be some Faustian bargain; stability and not-freaking-out-loved-ones in return for all creativity.
10634,"To be honest, though, I had been in a stall for about a year prior to the meds; too depressed to do much of anything anyway."
10635,"So, meds."
10636,and with a depressant episode and meds.
10637,she wants to radically change my meds.
10638,"This is a huge jump and I could use a lot of advice, I've only been on medication for a year or two but I like would alternate between wonderful and a living hell before I was diagnosed and I don't want to go back to that."
10639,What else can I do to ensure that I stay stable and asymtomatic (if I can) off medication?
10640,I should mention that he forgot to take his medicine once during the first week at home and had a manic episode.
10641,"It turns out that he's not taking his medication anymore now that he's gone back to school, and has been going through some ups and downs the past week."
10642,Is this a scenario where family steps in and calls the shots until he takes his medicine regularly?
10643,"Hi,
I wonder if the psychatrist that prescribed Venlafaxine for a 60yr old bipolar diagnosed person (was on lithium and other meds before but did not take lithium for at least 10 yrs and other meds for at least 1yr) is the right choice."
10644,Fortunately my meds and treatment have helped me not experience that extreme in a while.
10645,"I've tried a lot as her roommate to give her some tips for success, and encourage her to see her psychiatrist regularly--take her meds regularly, get therapy."
10646,"It's not my meds, it was always that way, even as a kid I just wake up feeling like shit."
10647,All I want is the correct medication and coping techniques to help.
10648,"Not to mention I hate the medicine they prescribed me, but I have no healthcare so I'm screwed."
10649,"I've been off of medication and haven't seen a mental health professional since 2010, both by choice."
10650,"Does anyone else experience these irrational fears, and if so, what do you do about it other than medication (not that I'm knocking anyone for being on meds, you do you!!"
10651,"Or, is there a specific medication that you take just for anxiety or paranoia??"
10652,"I don't want meds, but therapy has been helping."
10653,"Two years ago, after being diagnosed with Schizoaffective depressed type, I went off my meds and experienced bipolar symptoms."
10654,"I had meds, so I started taking them again and no mental health professional saw me during that time."
10655,Going through work during the summer without taking the medicine was good for the most part.
10656,I've heard that taking two different bp medicines at once helps balance out emotions.
10657,"i don't want to just get a sample pack of medication, i would like to start counseling as well."
10658,I was losing my insurance and in turn access to my full range of medications.
10659,This combination of meds had been a life saver for me.
10660,After that 100$ plus cost of medication.
10661,Over the next few months I tried a few different medications.
10662,So I tried new medication after new medication.
10663,"I have tried over ten new medications, each one making things worse and worse."
10664,Just go back to my old meds without her help.
10665,This last go around she put me on meds for pmdd and PTSD on top of all the other shit.
10666,So I saw my psychiatrist today to get my medicine prescriptions refilled.
10667,That's why I'm in therapy and taking medication.
10668,I don't even know how it's like to have a job and be an adult without medication.
10669,I feel like the medication is making me age and my body is getting weaker from overmedication.
10670,I don't know if I'm even capable of waking up for work and sleeping without the help of meds.
10671,I think it's the medicine.
10672,Mistake #2 was to continue telling my parents that I was seeing the psych and taking the medication.
10673,"At Christmas, I told them I was no longer on medication but I continued to see the psychiatrist once a month."
10674,Did you go off all meds?
10675,Which meds did you stay on and why?
10676,"My mind works 'beautifully' - and the meds keep me nice, but I still cant seem to stand the 'Blandness' of the Normal world, people, clearly now more than ever, are ....Meh......basically they're off enjoying Prime time TV, and I cant find anything to satisfy my mind."
10677,Is this normal on these meds?
10678,It seems like I have a serious chemical imbalance due to bipolar disorder and the most important thing is to find meds that balance me out.
10679,"I'm challenged with Seroquel, it's for life and coming off and on as I have done with every other medication, he cautions me, will be seriously adverse and worse than going unmedicated."
10680,"I am on medication, but am still in the process of gradually building up to my intended dose - it is helping (believe it or not), but not fast enough or thoroughly enough."
10681,"I'm trying to pull myself out, trying to get meds right, exercising, etc."
10682,"Now I can't even bring myself to cook, clean, do work or even take my medication--even though I know it puts me at a very real risk of another heart attack &amp; death."
10683,"I'm on abilify, klonopin, &amp; stallera for this problem but they seem to have lost their mojo--which leaves me on shaky ground as this combo was already my last resort--everything else seems to have a history of dangerous drug interactions with my meds for my RA."
10684,Alternative meds etc?
10685,"I've been doing so well, and am scared about what will happen if I'm forced to abruptly stop taking my meds."
10686,I just want her to support me and understand rather than act like nothing is wrong and that meds will just magically make it all better.
10687,"I've seen so much about ""the"" rash, and I handle medications so poorly I'm almost sure I'll get it."
10688,"I've gotten terrible side effects from every medication I've tried, including Serotonin Sydrome when I was taking antidepressants."
10689,I'm just terrified of another bad medication from big pharmaceutical companies paying my doctor to prescribe.
10690,Your perception of yourself is better than any medicine.
10691,"The dietary change of this and magnesium have combined to attenuate both illnesses to the most significant degree, more drastic than any medication I have started."
10692,Maybe the ketones are tag teaming with my meds to stop all the unnecessary moodiness I go through?
10693,"The meds I take are Lamicatal (mood stabilizer), zyprexa (anti psychotic/manic), and Nardil(anti-depressant)."
10694,What meds work for you?
10695,She sometimes tries to provoke me by making hurtful comments like condescendingly asking if I forgot to take my medicine that day.
10696,It's been a roller coaster of medications and unsuccessful treatment.
10697,"I was just diagnosed with bipolar ii and from what I've read, specific treatments are currently lacking in evidence but meds and lifestyle changes in favor of structure seem to be a good route."
10698,"I know it's a little ridiculous to be thinking this after just two  medication switches, but I can't help but wonder."
10699,"I think that may actually be the part of my meds that are working properly, but I'm not entirely sure."
10700,It's either the meds that are going to kill me or myself.
10701,My meds won't help me with primal fear!
10702,My medication keeps me somewhat stable but it is the only thing that keeps me going anymore without medication I am very suicidal.
10703,"I am not planning on stopping my meds, I have begun the routine again."
10704,"I'm on a fair amount of medication, but we recently added 20 mg of Namenda/day to the regime."
10705,So I am a frequent stopper on the /r/bipolar forum and have listed my issues recently with my meds not helping with my depression.
10706,I hit a new low yesterday and no amount of meds in the world could help me out of this hole.
10707,I feel normal(ish) now and I was wondering why I don't seem to have any negative side effects from the seroquel - does it mean that I need the medicine to fix my brains chemistry?
10708,But the meds haven't been working.
10709,I've been taking medication for the whole 1.5 years but have been able to find a good enough cocktail.
10710,One of the major concerns was just her taking her medication.
10711,(I don't care if the medication was super expensive either.)
10712,"When I was given fluoxetine, the first four weeks were hell - Strong depressed response (which differs from the traditional manic response) they changed my meds to Venlafaxine instead which seems (at least to me) to have induced rapid cycling."
10713,"Anyone had any experience with both these medications, or at least thoughts on either?"
10714,I've been seeing a therapist since I was 17 (25 now) and am on meds.
10715,Usually my downswings last a little longer but I may have found something outside of medication that helps.
10716,"What medication (if any) are you on, milligrams, and time you take it."
10717,On a scale of 1-10 how does this medication(s) work for you?
10718,"After being diagnosed, I am looking to find some similarities in my condition verse others and see which medication I might want to try to start."
10719,"Next medication was Lamotrigine, which I was very hopeful of, since reading up on it."
10720,"I know I can be a better person but I dont have any diagnosis yet, and I have yet to find any medication to help whatever the heck is wrong with me."
10721,Since I was diagnosed just a few short weeks ago I've been on one hell of a medication bender.
10722,I can't even tell if it's because of the meds or just natural progression.
10723,I am not on any other medications...I'd take more ororate but I'm not sure what the upper limit on that is.
10724,Being on medication.
10725,How does the medication change you?
10726,"I've already taken a ton of my meds, in hope it will assist."
10727,"I'm on another medication for joint pain currently, and my mother is treating me as if the pain I've been having lately is all in my head after telling her what the psychiatrist said."
10728,"That aside, what can I expect from medications?"
10729,"I finally got back on meds, but I still fell into an awful depression this winter and had a breakdown landing me in hospital for ten days in December."
10730,"I went without medication for 3 years, but after I had my daughter 8 months ago I became worse then ever."
10731,She said no as they can be addicting and we should just get my other meds stable in my system and try a different approach.
10732,I was off meds for almost 2 years so it's not like I have some addiction.
10733,I finally (fingers crossed) found my medication cocktail awhile ago.
10734,"I finally went to a doctor yesterday, and they said it was either in my head, my medicine, chronic fatigue syndrome, or fibromyalgia."
10735,So great I dont think I need meds.
10736,"So, I must look in the mirror and tell myself that I am only able to be truly me if I take this medication every day."
10737,"I will compromise and medicate, but in exchange I ask that you stop associating cruel stigmatic words with mental illness and medication, for it is soul crushing."
10738,"Sorry if this isn't very coherent, I've got my medicine on board for the night and I haven't slept well because of nightmares the last few days."
10739,"Did not help me, weekly monitoring of meds, group therapy, individual therapy."
10740,I stopped taking depression medication Sept of 2010.
10741,"I realize now that I might ahve to get on medication again and it's terrifying, years of playing with doses and types and wishing so hard that there would be a magic bullet pill to support me, but it never worked."
10742,If I need to get on meds(this time for bipolar NOT depression) I will.
10743,"It can lead to depression apparently and I am sure that the combination of my condition, the medications I take, my dspraxia and NLD, and the sleep apnea have put me into a very lethargic and annoyed state."
10744,I don't see what the point of being on meds are.
10745,I start feeling great and instead of attributing feeling better to the medication I always tell myself it's something I did and don't need the medicine.
10746,My depression has come back as well as my paranoia and I'm too worried (anxiety of course) to tell my doctor I quit taking my medicine.
10747,"Hi, 
I am bi-polar and I was wondering if anyone had tried this as an alternative to psych meds that make me even worse."
10748,I have been off my medication (cipralex + seroquel &gt; wellbutrin + abilify &gt; lithium carbonate + valproate + abilify) for two years now.
10749,"Or will this get more and more severe no matter what, even with medication?"
10750,I'm slowly coming around to the time of year when (before meds) I would progress into a manic state.
10751,"This year (now that I know what's really going on) I am on my meds and think everything should be fine, and was reassured by my doc, but wanted to know what y'all have to say!"
10752,"Tania's husband Joe is present and reports that Tania has taken medications ""for years....lithium, Depakote, tegretol, topomax, zyprexa, Geodon..etc""  Joe states that ""due to the medications and her not caring for herself she gots to take shots in her belly everyday to make sure that her sugars is good."""
10753,"She started having periods of sadness, dysphoric mood, thoughts of death either difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much, and 6 months after these symptoms began she attempted to OD on over the counter medications."
10754,After 2 months on an antidepressant medication Tania began to have periods of euphoria where she thought she could achieve any task.
10755,"It sucks so bad because I finally know what is wrong, finally am on the right meds (was on SSRIs and stimulants) and finally feel like myself, but I have lost my family and half of my friends because they took his side (not understanding bipolar and what it causes)."
10756,I check out this sub and see so many mentions of medications and the dosages similar to what I used to be on (pill organizers!)
10757,1) What treatments or medications are you on?
10758,2) How many times have you been asked to commit yourself/go inpatient when you change meds?
10759,"4) Do you find it odd that the first option for treatment (well, really in conjunction with therapy sessions) upon diagnosis or theory of diagnosis is medication, especially when the prescriptions have known and common adverse side effects?"
10760,"instead of ""western medicine""?"
10761,5) Do you find it odd that we're prescribed meds to treat the side effects of other meds?
10762,Consider it odd that many times the side effects are the same/worse than going without medication?
10763,"When I asked my 'distinguished' psychiatrist of three years how long I'd have to be on medication and she said without hesitating ""The Rest Of Your Life"" despite the fact my symptoms had only gotten worse on medications, I took a risk and maybe/probably saved my own life."
10764,She's on medication and sees a therapist regularly but I really don't think she's getting the help she needs.
10765,Does anyone know of any websites that sell such meds like Latuda online and ship worldwide?
10766,Turns out that I was put on a medication years before that caused bipolar symptoms.
10767,So I got taken off of all meds and feel great - except for the fact that I still feel so cloudy.
10768,"So I stopped taking my bipolar meds, and started only on wellbutrin, which has dramatically helped me."
10769,"So I took my sleeping meds, double the amount I was supposed to take."
10770,Latuda ended up giving me extreme anxiety issues so I went to Seroquel as my sleep medicine.
10771,Been off meds for about a year and some now.
10772,Only way to do that is medicine.
10773,"I'm back to that lethargic, staring into space depression I had before getting on medication."
10774,"My therapist appt is this week, but she can't change my meds."
10775,I would like some thoughtful responses on how your medication helps you.
10776,Please don't tell me all about your side effects in this post- I want to hear descriptions about how medications are legitimately helpful.
10777,"*If medications can help me in a social context, I might consider taking them again."
10778,*How* do your meds help you?
10779,He was given serotonin and anxiety meds and won't take them.
10780,"Things you don't know about me: I am a person with mental illness, who takes medication and likes to occasionally shoot guns."
10781,My meds don't help (Valporate) and I am not taking any others they involve lithium and antipsychotics.
10782,I was just diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder about a month ago and am currently working my way up to the proper dosage of medication.
10783,*  I can't drink because of all my medicines and find myself starting to feel really left out.
10784,"I'm happy with my meds, but I'm more controlled versus cured lol."
10785,It seems as if my meds aren't even making a dent anymore.
10786,"Don't worry though, I CANT stop my meds because as frustrated and angry I am with them,  I can't risk getting worse and losing my job, seeing as my SO has been unemployed for 8 months -- which is why I could only do a month of PHP when I needed extra help earlier this year, we need the money and SDI wasn't enough."
10787,In four weeks I have an appointment with my psychiatrist to see how I'm reacting to the medicine.
10788,Especially if I don't take medication.
10789,The real reason being that I don't want medication to control my thought process and subsequent behaviour.
10790,"Doctors take so long to see, I keep getting put on and taken off medication and my whole faith in the system has just gone so I kind of don't really see staying here as an option anymore."
10791,I have a terrible sore throat and a small amount of googling showed me it's a side effect of my new medication.
10792,I would hate to have to stop taking this medication before it actually started working because of some shitty side effects :(
10793,"I believe part of the weight gain is from all the medications I'm on by my psychiatrist said it is not and maybe I should check about the birth control I'm on, and my gynecologist says no that it is probably from the assortment of other meds."
10794,"However, the medications work for me and I'm scared to try and switch because of fear of other meds not working as well or having worse side effects."
10795,"When I began there, I didn't take any meds and I felt much clearer and my mind just seemed to work better...which meant I climbed the ladder quickly."
10796,This is the first time I've taken any kind of medication except some painkillers now and then.
10797,some years ago and since then I've just avoided the whole medication-thing.
10798,"That being said, I know only rotten things come from being off the meds."
10799,"Before I was put on any meds, I was able to drop from 275 to 190."
10800,It's to the point where I am weighing (No pun intended) the idea of taking myself off my meds to see that if that helps get me back down.
10801,I hate how my medicine has me in a continuous fog lately feeling out of touch and I have almost zero motivation.
10802,I'm thinking of slowly getting off my medicine.
10803,I have never been a big believer in medicine and to be honest I am terrible at remembering to take anything on a schedule.
10804,I made the decision to go back to my meds because of it and because my spouse seems to get the brunt of my frustration.
10805,"Here are some options I'm considering:
1) Self medication or adjust my meds- raise my dose of anti-depressants, or add in one I was on and have hoarded some I was on."
10806,"2) No medication- I really don't feel like I could feel much worse, so why not try?"
10807,My husband had been taking medication for his bipolar disorder for about 6 years.
10808,He didn't like having to take medication but it kept him pretty stable and he seemed to be happy.
10809,He wanted to try living without any medication to see if he could control his bipolarity with willpower.
10810,Three days does not seem like enough time to get a new medication right.
10811,I am currently diagnosed with bipolar NOS and have been on medications for 4 years.
10812,I at one point quit all medication cold turkey for 7 days and went on extreme episode.
10813,She only does my meds and always seems to know my brain better than me.
10814,"From my therapist I wouldn't think it was odd, but we never ever talk about anything other than my moods and my meds."
10815,That dullness caused by meds.
10816,"I've been afraid of this medication, much like I was Lithium."
10817,Crazymeds.us doesn't have a page for haldol for that list.
10818,The meds put way too much weight on me.
10819,"One side may find a medication great, while the other side hates it, but when asked by a psychiatrist and forced to give an answer, I'll choose one opinion and completely forget the other depending on what side is dominant at the time."
10820,"I have no guarantee that the meds I'm on will work forever, or that there will be another med that allows me to live as well as I do now."
10821,All I need is one good mania to decide I never want to take meds again and get myself thrown in jail ... again.
10822,I have to sometimes explain that I can’t do certain things because of my medicine.
10823,"""Oh… what medicine do you take?"""
10824,"I’m stabilized on meds."""
10825,But I am seeing my case manager and doctor next week to go over some things and I hope to find the right mix of medications to make it so I can work again.
10826,I have bipolar disorder and anxiety and have been taking medication for a decade now (currently on Fluoxetine).
10827,"For the longest time people assumed I had depression, and I resisted taking medication for it because it made me scared and for some weird reason I thought staying in bed hating myself for days at a time was a lesser evil."
10828,There's a number of ads on craiglslist offering to pay bipolar patients for trying out new medications.
10829,"Up until 6 months ago, my medicine concoction was 400mg Lamictal, 30mg Deplin, 5mg Ablify, 5mg Xanax XR and I can't remember what dose but Lexapro as well."
10830,I've been in probably the worst depression episode since I quit taking medicine for the past 2 weeks or so?
10831,I don't particularly want to get back on medicine since I've been doing well with therapy but any one know of some other methods of coping?
10832,Part of the deal I made with myself was if my bipolar got too out of control again I would get back on medicine but I want to give this a fighting chance.
10833,"---

My mom has been diagnosed as bipolar for about 15 years (not sure technically what 'type', she has both severe depressive and manic episodes) but medications have never seemed to make a real difference for her."
10834,With meds I have had a much better distance between my hypomanic and depressive episodes.
10835,I am especially not good at taking care of myself I have a really hard time being consistent so when ive done therapy or medication i always quit with in a month or two.
10836,Has anyone else experienced this on their medications along with the noises or only at night?
10837,It took about six months to get me stabilized on medication.
10838,I take my medication exactly how I am supposed to have haven't really had any symptoms for a while.
10839,"I missed 2 doses of my medicine, lamotrigine, this week and I'm wondering if it's a side effect to be really angry and violent just from that short amount of time or I need to be on a different medicine."
10840,"Then it would end with him telling me that I just need to trust the meds, and that I need therapy."
10841,I recently went to a CBT (control behavioral therapy group) and that's where I met her and started my medication regimen/therapy sessions.
10842,"So, the week before last I was in inpatient for a little under a week(weekday doc wanted to keep me longers, god bless the weekend doc) I went in for a depressive episode that came on hard and fast after a manic one(my cycles are a week or two long) Anyway, while there they of course, changed my meds."
10843,I'm over the angst of having to take meds and just kind of live my life waiting for my hair to fall out and eyeing every itch on my arms.
10844,There have been issues with medication and as of the moment I have been off of one of my major meds for over a month now.
10845,I implore anyone that is struggling to get with a doctor and get your medication figured out.
10846,I have an appointment at the end of this month and I know it will take a good 6 weeks at least till my meds are back in some form of use to my disorder.
10847,"That was a little personal...

Mania + meds + booze = crazy night + 18 hour hangover so far..."
10848,"Also, I'm not on meds at the moment so I know it's not side effects or anything."
10849,"Yeah, so first off here is a list of my current meds."
10850,That way I can do the whole trial and error BS with different meds.
10851,"So I've been sober for nearly 5 months and taking meds religously, and it's the most lonely and awful thing."
10852,Ok so decided to go to the doctor to try and get back on meds but couldn't remember what I was taking so she said she is going to start me on them one at a time and will start with lithium.
10853,"After the objective creation of modern medicine after the Napoleonic wars it no longer treated vague subjective descriptions of ailments, like the patient had red spots on their arm, but rather found the commonalities between sufferers in order to be able to use what cured one to help another, lacerations along the sinister antebrachium suggest steroidal treatments."
10854,"For bipolar disorder it seems as though everything can effect it, exercise, sleep, nutrition, relationships, stress and what doctors give us, medication."
10855,I'll not be allowed a phone and I'll be put on meds.
10856,"They'll let me out for exams and I'll finally have medication (year + without, torture.)"
10857,"I'm currently 23, but despite the short amount of time that I've been officially diagnosed, I've gone through different meds, different therapists, and one hospital stay."
10858,"The medications I am currently taking are lamictal, seroquel, lexapro, ativan, and wellbutrin."
10859,I don't know if it's me or the meds.
10860,"I love it, doctor tries to convince me to continue my meds when I'm in this phase."
10861,"So I'm addicted to OTC sleep medications, I've shared this with my therapist but not my psychiatrist."
10862,"Went off meds for pregnancy, that went genuinely well."
10863,"So, now feeling quite normal and in the process of getting a job, I feel that I don't want to take any medication because why take something when everything feels fine?"
10864,"EDIT: one of the main reasons why I don't want to take medication at this point is that I was put on Olanzapine in my major depressive episode due to ridiculous insomnia and that shit made me ridiculously lethargic, lack motivation or concern for anything i.e."
10865,"The new psychiatrist was very inexperienced and all the changes  made in my medications have been suggested by me, so I'm almost treating myself, but paying him for it."
10866,"Thanks

Edited: Forgot one medication"
10867,seems like a lot of you take multiple medications.
10868,She had a doctor who put her in anti depressants and anti anxiety medicine when she was depressed but she didn't take it or see the doctor for long.
10869,"Since being on the medication I've been especially forcing myself to do things that ""should"" make me happy, but I've just been numb."
10870,"I've been on a lot of medication in the past, and none of it has done much for me."
10871,(Mostly SSRIs/antidepressant/anti-anxiety meds).
10872,I hated being on the medication merry-go-round previously since I never really got much out of it.
10873,"Anyways, I'm already feeling anxious to change medication (I haven't wanted to be on my current medication since I wanted to try Lamictal, but I'm trying to give this Risperdal a chance)."
10874,"It's like, I'm already trying to think of other medications/therapies/etc that might help."
10875,"I also have a ton of trauma in my past which my psychiatrist says ""complicates"" things, but I have no idea how that would impact how medication works."
10876,I practically begged one doc to put me on ADD medication (have been diagnosed with ADD in the past) and was told that I needed to work on other things first.
10877,I'm slowly hurting myself with over the counter medicines and I don't care.
10878,I haven't consistently taken meds in like a year and a half.
10879,"I haven't been off of an antidepressant since the first time I started taking meds, and I really don't want to get depressed again."
10880,"I am assuming that you still get depressed or manic on meds, just with the volume turned down a lot?"
10881,"I am afraid that I'm getting depressed, and even though it's a FAR cry different from where I was before (out of control, pre-medicine), it's still not how I want to live."
10882,If you are anti-medicine do not comment I don't want to hear it thank you.
10883,"i also have very severe add, and i can't find a medication that works for that."
10884,"i missed a few days of my meds a little over a month ago and decided that i was feeling better than usual- sharper, more creative, making connections and feeling passion again."
10885,*  I've been off meds for 6+ months.
10886,I'm afraid to get help again and I don't want to burden my parents with the cost of sessions and medication.
10887,"Also, um, so what is this magical psychotropic medication that comes with an instant on/off switch, again?"
10888,"I stopped taking medication 8 months ago, after only taking it for 5-6 months."
10889,I have trouble remembering if this was better on medication or not.
10890,"Is it really going to be impossible to live without medication for a ""more stable"" life?"
10891,Could this medication give me a false positive?
10892,I just don't feel ready at this point to go through the intense process of finding the correct medication/ going through therapy.
10893,"I started Computer Science for the money, I wanted to go to medical school because I wanted to prove that I'm not a loser (though I also have a strong interest in medicine), I almost joined the Marines when I was 17 because I wanted to look like a badass, which is dangerous when you're manic, I wanted to go into zoology because I had it in my head that I could be a badass zoo keeper and play with tigers and stuff...none of it has really been something that I'm actually passionate about."
10894,I stayed on my medication for maybe a month then just stopped.
10895,So I took some of the pain meds and did bio freeze.
10896,I didn't start to get help until I was 19 for various reasons and it was until now (that I am 21) that I started to actually go on meds.
10897,They came back a while back after telling me psychiatry is a lie and their medicines are poison that makes people zombies.
10898,"Now, you might be thinking, oh yes, he probably needs to see a doctor and get meds/therapy before it's too late, and I'd agree and quite frankly, he'd agree."
10899,"His mom doesn't want him on any psychiatric meds, she complains about the side effects, yet, she's the main one that gets fucking pissed if he's depressed or arguing with her."
10900,"""Oh we'll take you to a doctor, but they won't give you any kind of medication"", ""it's just the devil"", ""you'll be fine"", ""maybe you just need to stop using your computer, if I were mom I would've taken your computer away""."
10901,"While in that state, I decided that life was worth living, and I needed to be on meds."
10902,The doctor started me on new meds recently.
10903,I started getting a rash shortly after starting the meds.
10904,"After going cold turkey on my medications, then moving to a depressant (the antihistamine), then completely off it, my body chemistry decided to play ping pong."
10905,I was introduced to bipolar meds in prison where I was given depakote and zyprexa daily.
10906,"I've always been one to branch off when talking, getting lost in subtext, but since I settled into my meds my train of thought get's lost so incredibly easy and quick, and I need help figuring out where I started."
10907,Earlier I thought seriously about overdosing on meds I have.
10908,"Pretty early on, she told me that she has bipolar disorder, is on medication, and has spent many years going through therapy and working herself out."
10909,"When brought up to my dr. (I get free healthcare from my native clinic) they said they wouldn't add any other medication for depression due to manic triggers, is there any mix of medication that have worked for you guys?"
10910,"I'm a 23yo female, and am currently not on medication (even when I was, I still had problems with my anger)."
10911,Is this something that medication could assist with?
10912,"When I beat that bout of depression, I thought I was home-free, especially because I beat it without going on medication."
10913,TLDR: I've had conflicting diagnoses from different professionals and really bad experiences with medications.
10914,"So again, my question: I want to do everything possible to stop these cycles but I'm terrified of trying medication after my last experiences."
10915,"I've been taking my medications regularly and my lifestyle hasn't changed...  Perhaps more stress in school, although this semester is going better than the previous two/three."
10916,I made sure to take my meds throughout.
10917,About two weeks ago I decided to go off my meds out of frustration and embarrassment.
10918,I felt like a freak for needing meds and like I was in a good enough place without them.
10919,I think my meds are working but not well enough.
10920,"... And when they were exchanging thoughts on different medications ('Seroquel, Trazodone...') she got all excited: ooooh it's so cool that I recognize all of these because we learned about them at uni!"
10921,"Over the past year he spent a period of time taking some different medicines (I do not remember the exact ones) and ended up having some bad experiences with them such as seizures or just total loss of emotion or ""creativity"" as he phrased it."
10922,Because of the bad experiences he quit taking the medicine and recently things have started to get bad again.
10923,"Some of these charges are drug related, he got into it before bipolar was big in his life but a lot of our family thinks the drugs are a form of self medication."
10924,"Somewhat related, as always when I get like this, I need to go to a doc and sort out therapy or meds, or just /something/."
10925,"I am on medication, but I continue to be triggered by everything I see and hear."
10926,I have tried six medications before the two I am on now.
10927,He's gone off his meds and are convinced they caused him to be near suicidal during his intense depression.
10928,"He was recently diagnosed with BP1 following a similar month-long manic episode with a psychotic break, put on meds during his deep depression, and now is back to mania when he stopped the meds after he started becoming hypomanic."
10929,I have tried various medications but I always end up smoking unnatural things and eventually drinking when I'm out of connections.
10930,"Life without psych meds is, in my opinion, much better."
10931,I do not want to be put back on meds.
10932,Even if I had an appointment tomorrow most medications take weeks to work.
10933,My boyfriend is diagnosed as bipolar but is currently not taking his medication because of the negative side effects.
10934,He wants to start taking his medicine so he will be more stable and he said that it would help us so I'm anxiously awaiting that.
10935,"My journal entry for the day...

Late day
Crying in the shower
Crying in the car
Not able to answer questions or do my job as succinctly as I once did
Didn't get to sleep till 2:30am
Figured it doesn't matter if I don't sleep
And it doesn't matter if I'm late
Also doesn't matter if I take a long lunch break
Finally got to talk to husband, just now
He doesn't want to talk to me
He figures I need to be alone
Or silent
That I'm in a funky mood
That he can't deal with
I told him I'm going to anthr doc Monday
Hopefully she'll prescribe meds
I gues i was somewhat too enthused over the Fone
To which he berated me for it
Asked me if that was the reason I'm seeing docs (to get rxs)
He laughed, but it's not funny 
Then told me I need to grow up
Stop being immature
Take responsibility for ur actions
So I did
I cut myself
And I cut again..."
10936,"Then I continued ""what if I'm taking medicine for parasites?"
