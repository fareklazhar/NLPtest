0,I have been recently diagnosed and have just started therapy.
1,I am having an issue concerning my therapist.
2,"On one hand I feel I should share this information with her, but on the other I fear this would have me switched to another therapist."
3,I've tried medications but they only made me feel like a zombie and going to sit down with a therapist only increases my anxiety.
4,"I think I might have social anxiety (but since I've never been diagnosed I can't really say, I'm really afraid of therapists/psychologists)."
5,"I've been through my share of doctors, therapy, emergency room visits, diagnoses, breakdowns, etc."
6,"I didn't really like going to therapy, I felt it didn't help me."
7,"I've been going to another therapist I kind of like, I've gone twice."
8,"I've talked to my mom about it and she says that I probably don't need it and if I do, the therapist will prescribe some to me."
9,I scheduled a GP appointment last week and he diagnosed me with anxiety and panic disorder and referred me to a psych for further evaluation and medication and a therapist.
10,"My first therapist appt will be next week and I'm sure it'll be a long and hard journey, but I'm super excited!"
11,"I've been to therapy, but it didn't help at all."
12,"I'm also trying to find work, or at least something I can do through my computer to make money, so I can start seeing a proper therapist, getting some new glasses, and just buying some things that I desperately need."
13,After about the fifth med he said lets just throw that all out and go for psychotherapy.
14,"Problem being, the area I'm in is extremely underserved for psychiatrists and therapists and I have to go with a hospital group that has pay on a sliding scale for uninsured/poor people, and the only one anywhere close is apparently booked for two months."
15,"My doctor refuses to prescribe TCAs or benzos, and I'm currently facing barriers getting therapy (can't self-refer for treatment for anxiety over using the phone without making a 30-minute phone call)."
16,"This morning I had an intense therapy session, basically had a meltdown and worked my way through a stack of tissues."
17," I'm a high school senior and I'd like to get help for my anxiety/depression, ( doctor not a therapist) but i have no idea how to bring up the topic with my mother or how to go about it."
18,Another option I could take is using a therapist - maybe using a CBT based approach.
19,"He told me to get a doctors note but as I have no money right now I'm not sure how to get one, I would like to see a therapist and discuss it (I'm feeling better now but I'd like to understand more about why it happened) Are there any options I could look at for free or set up to pay after i get my paycheck for a first session?"
20,I don't see how therapy can really help right now and I don't think talking about this is an option with my parents.
21,"I go to the gym several days a week, see a therapist and am about to begin taking antidepressants."
22,"I'll try not to make this a wall of text so let's try bullets:
  
- Been in therapy for 4 years (psychodynamic)  
- Hitting a point in my life where I need to figure out what I'm doing with it  
- Lost faith my therapist can help me (he gave me advice in past that didn't work out well, he maintains he's not to blame for the emotions that resulted)  
  
Now, I'm scared and don't know what to do next."
23,I will also look into meditation and possibly therapy.
24,I have to figure out what I want in life and I need to talk to a therapist.
25,So recently I've been thinking about seeing a therapist to see if I can approach the issue from a different direction.
26,"For those that see/have seen a therapist:  
What kind of realistic expectations should I have going in to therapy?"
27,Is it normal to start therapy without having a goal?
28,"I am taking the 5-HTP and meeting with a therapist to try to help, but this week after my first meeting I have had even more attacks of itching (even reading this group to find some answer had me scratching all over)."
29,The body needs darkness at night just as much as it needs an appropriate amount of sunlight during the day (you may of heard about darkness therapy).
30,Anyway I decided to try these glasses to cut down blue light since I kept coming across this type of therapy.
31,"I think I found that I was overdoing the therapy, I was doing this every night from sundown till the moment I shut my eyes in bed."
32,"I remember how, when I was going last year, she would ask me often: ""Has the therapist helped at all?"
33,She was an alternative-medicine type therapist and helped me talk some things out and give me some coping strategies.
34,"My doctor recommended therapy, but there's absolutely no way I can afford it."
35,"I refrain from going out in public as much as possible, including going on walks, which my therapist recommended to help me."
36,"Anyways, I had my first appt with a therapist last week."
37,"Consequently, ativan has become a big part of the strategy that she has used to combat her anxiety for most of her adult life (she has regularly attended therapy for as long as I've known her but it has never been much of a help); and now it has been taken away with nothing to replace it."
38,"I saw therapists and a psychiatrist, who put me on Lexapro, which has helped me tons."
39,"I go to therapy and am on fluoxetine, which has been awesome."
40,They also offer some perks like 6 sessions of therapy.
41,"I always feel the need to make them feel better, its as though my brain just picks up all the uneasiness of others, makes them feel better and in return i end up stuck with all these shit feelings...

i dont know what to do and am honestly considering therapy or some medications that will just calm me down."
42,"But does anyone maybe have any tips for dealing with things like I've described, short of therapy or more/different medication?"
43,I'm also talking to a therapist who seems to have all the faith in me.
44,I do CBT therapy and it helps but this week has been the hardest for years.
45,"After finally listening to my therapist, I once again cleared my mind and saw major improvements."
46,"She started going to therapy for her own issues and wants me to go with her this coming Thursday, as much as I want to go I don't want to promise her anything because I'm afraid I won't be able to go when the time comes."
47,I've contacted some local therapists and have a blood test next week so hopefully I'll have a greater understanding of it all fairly soon.
48,I'm currently in group therapy which I primarily like because I'm meeting wonderful people who are going through the same thing and would never judge me for my problems.
49,"I remember thinking, when I started going to therapy at that age, that this would be something I'd grow out of by the time I was the age I am now."
50,"I'm on an SSRI that helps but hasn't been much the past month, I go to therapy weekly."
51,I have a very hectic schedule with full time work and school so I can't fit more therapy in than I do.
52,"My armchair opinion (and that of a couple therapists) is that I've basically had pretty severe GAD my whole life, and when you combine that with stuff that's happened through my life, I've picked up the symptomology of other disorders."
53,"When I'm in therapy, I'm always at such a crisis point that the therapy has to focus on the immediate need, and not on long-term."
54,"I just really wanted to put this out there, not sure if it makes sense, but I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow and I'm sure I'll be hashing all this out there too."
55,I am just exhausted emotionally and wanted to hear some POV of fellow anxious redditors who may have good / bad experiences with medication therapy.
56,I started seeing a psychologist/therapist in March for couples therapy with my partner for reasons I've posted about previously and also meet with her individually to work on things I'd like to work on about myself.
57,"It's ""only"" been 5.5 months since I started talk therapy and trying CBT."
58,"In that regard, talk therapy has helped."
59,"I would really like to ask my therapist about medication, but I'm scared."
60,"I don't want to stop therapy, but I don't think it's enough."
61,"I'm going to therapy on Monday for my first appointment, but I'm extremely scared."
62,"I'm irritable at the best of times, which my therapist told me is related to my GAD."
63,"I keep putting off making an appointment with a psychologist because I have no insurance (but I do have savings to use), and having to get back into therapy makes my heart hurt."
64,I'm getting my own therapy to deal with the childhood abuse (to disclose it was sexual abuse and I'm a guy so that presents some unique problems via stigma with an order of extra stigma.)
65,"Meditation and talk therapy are also part of my regiment, but this is one medicine change I've been very happy with."
66,I haven't been in therapy for a few weeks now because I've run out of money and my health insurance is gone.
67,"I originally started going to a therapist in January for an eating disorder, but that turned out to be a symptom."
68,"So I started seeing a different therapist for the anxiety, and I've started seeing improvement almost right away."
69,"So, I wanted to share the ""strategies"" I'm using (I'm not sure which are the most important factors or if they're working in combination): 

* **CBT** with the new therapist."
70,"As a side note, I went to therapy once for some emerging anxiety issues as a teenager, but I had a bad experience and have been stressed about trying that again, eventhough its a pretty broad suggestion for people like me."
71,"In panic, I tried to contact my specialist before I left, only to be told that I should go see a psychiatrist/therapist instead."
72,"I am seeing therapy, but I cannot take pride/comfort in myself for having potentially ruined the lives of others."
73,"I still have anxiety, but I know what causes them and I am able to if not avoid, at least lessen them through self-taught behaviour therapy."
74,"I'm also on medication for anxiety, and I'm seeing a therapist."
75,I've had experiences in the past with therapists who haven't identified that I have anticipatory anxiety and actually ended up dreading my appointments from anticipation so much that I stopped going to them.
76,"So, finally to my question, what kind of therapist should I seek out for help with this?"
77,I don't want a repeat of last time where my therapist wasn't even able to identify this even though my research shows that this is a pretty common anxiety problem with anyone who has an anxiety disorder.
78,I'm thinking that a cognitive behavioral therapist may be my best bet since they can work with me to give me coping skills.
79,I'm aim to start therapy and get help because I can't do it anymore.
80,I've scheduled an appointment with a therapist to work through this phobia but it isn't until next week.
81,I finally was able to get to a therapist with the help of my mom dragging me out of the house but I have only had one visit so far and the progress is going to be slow because I'm also suffering from PTSD.
82,I still plan on going to therapy and I now am optimistic that with these herbs and therapy I can overcome my anxiety.
83,"I was seeing a great therapist back home, but obviously had to quit seeing her when I left this past August."
84,"I got so desperate that I had an appointment with a therapist on campus here, on my birthday last Friday."
85,"I've also gone to a therapist, and that had no outcome other than strengthening my preconception that talking to a random person that happens to have a degree in the same way that I've talked to dozens of others in the past wouldn't do anything for me."
86,"Up until a few weeks back I was OBSESSED with the idea of developing schizophrenia, but a simple consultation with my therapist was enough to clear this up."
87,"Now, me and my therapist and my psychiatrist talk alot, and we agreed that a stimulant of some sort would be beneficial for me to become more extroverted and talk to people."
88,I told him how I've been trying to fix myself at home because my last doctor gave me pristiq which I couldn't handle and didn't give me any suggestions for therapy and he told me how he thinks I would benifit from having some professional help just to guide me better at overcoming my issues.
89,I also see a psychiatrist for psychotherapy every two weeks and he is amazing.
90,"Also, any other alternative therapies you have tried that I didn't list."
91,I've been living with depression and anxiety for quite some time now; I've been in and out of therapy for these issues since 1999.
92,"I called my doctor last week and asked for an appointment to see what I can do,  maybe get referred to a therapist."
93,"I went to one other therapist in my life a couple summers ago, but froze up."
94,"My conundrum is whether I should continue on from Thailand to Australia now, or come home and get some proper therapy for the anxiety and go to Australia  in september when I'm in a better frame of mind."
95,My therapist recommended this app to me to help combat some of my anxiety.
96,"Did my therapy, kept it up, gradually coming off the citalopram with my doctor's help."
97,I have been seeing a therapist who said after numerous test that I have ADD and a possible disorder.
98,"Previously he said he wanted to see a therapist, but now he keeps saying 'I don't trust people, I don't want to talk to them, it won't help'."
99,"I've seen a therapist in the past, after I bailed on a sort of similar trip at the last minute."
100,"i've been to therapy, have been taking remotiv(can someone confirm on tihs ) and magnesium twice a day."
101,I would never go to a therapist because nothing is bothering me on the inside – or more likely because I don’t want to admit I have any problems speaking to a doctor.
102,Before I start I gotta say I have been to a therapist and talked to them about this issue.
103,"I just asking for some second hand knowledge on something like this or a second opinion other then my therapist who was helpful in most other problem area's but when ever I covered this topic they just said ""keep up your defense against it, if you believe you can you will"" but doing so is just extremely exhausting."
104,"I mentioned this to my therapist and she advised me to think ""I want [crush's name] to reject me"" whenever I interact with him."
105,Trying to go to therapy but the campus counseling center is so booked they can only work me in twice a month.
106,I'm on waiting lists for the 2 other places in town offering therapy and it's been months and I've never gotten a call.
107,"It's gotten worse and worse over the past few months and all my therapist says is ""take a de-stress day, try going to yoga."""
108,"5 years on and with hypnotherapy, exercise , proper sleep and  cbt I'm 99% over it."
109,"I can't afford therapy, I'm a student, and I'd feel terribly guilty asking my parents money for therapy."
110,"I've been in therapy on and off for about 8 years, and have been seeing my current psychologist for almost 2 years."
111,I told myself I'd go to therapy the next day (for the first time).
112,"I still wanted to go to therapy the next day, but I felt unable to because I wasn't really upset."
113,"I understand that the obvious answer is to go see a therapist, which I plan on doing."
114,I can't even bring myself to get into therapy.
115,"I have an appointment with my doctor but it's not until Tuesday, and I heard it can take months to get an appointment with a therapist."
116,"However, towards the end of our relationship (1.5 years) I started to benefit from the school therapy groups."
117,"However, it seems that everything I do and everything my therapist helps me with are all preventative stuff."
118,I am on meds to no effect I suppose and therapy seems insane and stressful to me.
119,"I have since seen a psychiatrist, tried AD and am now in therapy."
120,Cue psychiatrist and therapist and I realize what I resent in him is the same thing I resented in myself.
121,I get grief from my therapist because I am incapable of having a solid definition of self.
122,So fuck off you dimwitted fuckwitted sugartits that think you are better than me because you hold the clipboard and the misconceptions that are therapy.
123,"On the other hand - therapy is good for learning tool sets to battle anxiety, depression and generally just share things that you can't share with others."
124,"I want my therapist's approval and praise, but on the other I want them to fuck off."
125,"She already said I can't do therapy either because we don't have the money, and even if we did I'd have no way to get to appointments once college starts back up."
126,I've also been diagnosed with depression (although right now it isn't so much a problem) and an eating disorder and I see a therapist for the ED and we often talk about both my depression and anxiety.
127,I started mindfullness with my therapist but I can't afford to see him anymore.
128,"Recently, my symptoms have greatly improved with therapy and meds."
129,"This has helped me to find breathing exorcises, meditation, and got me to talk to a therapist."
130,I went to see a therapist and the intern (the person who gathered my info) said SA is usually treated with 50/50 medication and therapy.
131,I have also gone to several sessions with a therapist.
132,Tried therapy but I'm so shy it didn't help a ton.
133,I've applied for some more scholarships and another college in town that can help save some more money but give me a few more prephysical therapy classes.
134,My grades aren't amazing so I won't be able to get into a physical therapy school and my art isn't amazing so I couldn't change to art school.
135,"I'm not in therapy now, but I have briefly seen psychologists several times over the years."
136,I take amitriptylene 50mg for headache and general anxiety but my therapist wants me to try an SNRI.
137,I'm wondering if behavioral therapy worked for any of you and how long did it take?
138,"I'm not going to bore you with a big wall of text about my background and symptoms (actually, I did type out a wall of text and then deleted it :D)... just that I've finally decided to see a therapist before my progressively worse obsession totally destroys my life and relationship once and for all."
139,"I'm struggling lately with anxiety, and started seeing a therapist and also started taking an antidepressant, which makes me feel less creative, less emotionally connected and less interested in others."
140,I guess I should talk to the therapist about this.
141,Has anyone successfully overcome anxiety through therapy alone?
142,"If you're anxiety is this big of a problem I am not qualified to help you, you need to see a therapist and learn tools to deal with it."
143,"I have gone to therapy for these two, but therapy has not been much help in terms of long-term."
144,"I am in therapy and it helps, I just wish I wasn't back tracking again."
145,"It is not ""talk"" therapy so I cannot ask the psychiatrist for advice on how I should handle this."
146,"I want to ask for a referral to a therapist, and for a couple of blood tests be done (vitamin D and iron)."
147,About this time I went to a therapist who specialized in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and it really did help to develop some coping mechanisms for the social anxiety.
148,I'd been to therapists before.
149,So I went to therapy.
150,"This is relevant because the model of therapy, which I have come to fully embrace and use for my own coaching of others though with my own secular take, basically says that we are born with all the tools we need to function as emotionally healthy happy people who engage in loving relationships with others."
151,"**

So three weeks ago I was in the middle of my weekly therapy session [when a different person took over for me."
152,"](http://www.reddit.com/r/DID/comments/30bfed/did_not_think_i_had_did_now_questioning_that_help/) I could pretty much hear and see what was going on, but he was at the controls, he was talking to my therapist, he was choosing what to look at and what to listen to."
153,My therapist was on vacation the past two weeks and when we left the session he was still in control.
154,"Anxiety-related:

* I'm terrified he's gonna come back
* Part of me kind of wants him to come back
* What on earth do I say to my therapist"
155,I've had a sleepless night due to intense anxiety and I need to keep myself occupied until I go to my therapist meeting in a few hours.
156,"Anything related to him was a trigger to me, but I managed to pull myself out of it with the help of a wonderful therapist and I could focus on university again."
157,My therapist and I found out the reason why I respond so terribly to being triggered by him is due to me being hurt in the past by people who purposefully did not wish to interact with me (I was bullied plenty as a child and potentially have social anxiety).
158,"tl;dr: very close friend can't handle friendship, ends things, i manage to cope, recently got massively triggered, feeling very low and anxious, wanting peace of mind

I'm hoping meeting with the therapist soon will help me find that."
159,I cannot afford therapy or medication.
160,Currently went to a therapist for the first time and now seeing where that goes.
161,And a therapist.
162,"Anyways, sob stories aside, I had been seeing a therapist since summer 2010 (before the storm) and then at college."
163,"I developed a drinking problem after my boyfriend lied and left me for slutsherface and didn't see a way out, and I had refused medication all my life saying there was ""another way"" but needed a helping hand other than my therapist and took the pill route."
164,Do I need a therapist?
165,"My therapist told me to go see our Office of Accessibility, and I just felt stupid coming into there."
166,I am planning on making an appointment Monday to see a therapist.
167,It's been about 5 years since I last saw a therapist.
168,I want to kind of practice saying what I need to say before I see the therapist so I can get it out without having a panic attack.
169,"EDIT: Also, I've never been to therapy, or been on any medication."
170,"The patient must go through a series of Cognitive therapy practices and medication must be supplemented to overcome these harmful thoughts."""
171,"I knew I needed help, so I went to see a therapist at school."
172,The only issue was that I was assigned a gay therapist.
173,I went to a new therapist and a psychologist at school and told them everything.
174,"I know easy things to do is to go to a therapist and a GI, but I just want to know ways how to calm myself in class, with a huge group of people around me...
*btw I'm a junior in high school,.so I'm 16
*just did this on my phone, so sorry with any mistakes and grammar/spelling errors on my part."
175,Should I go to a therapist?
176,Has anyone else successfully been treated by their doctor and not a therapist?
177,"My counsellor says there is no other place to do therapy + maybe I'm not ready for it yet, but my problem is how to I get any better to attend CBT sessions without any professional help."
178,I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since I was 11 and they've given me so many different pills and treatments and nothing helps.
179,"I have been on meds for just over 6 months now and have been through cbt therapy, I would say i have a clearer direction in my life and a lot less depressed then before, but my anxiety is still a major problem."
180,"Hello everybody,

my name is Pedro and I'm a psychologist and psychotherapist from Brazil."
181,Weekly therapy has helped me to make some progress in the past three years.
182,My therapist made a note of comparing that behavior of self-judgement to my parents' judgement.
183,"I have taken god knows how many prescription meds (Paxil and Wellbutrin, currently) and struggled through 10 years of therapy, including DBT, but I'm not doing so hot right now."
184,"It has movement classes and yoga, individual and group therapy, and a very relaxing, holistic and natural ""healing"" vibe to it that you just don't get in inpatient psychiatric care."
185,"The only problem is that I don't have the time to devote to creating my own program at home, and it wouldn't have the kind of support and therapy system I'm looking for."
186,"Bloodwork, physical therapy...but holy shit, I can not get rid of this back pain."
187,Doctor put me through an xray and found out it was a straightening cervical spine which can be remedied with physical therapy.
188,"Apart from therapy ofcourse, how can I make it better?"
189,"I'm going to talk to my therapist tomorrow, but until then is really like some help."
190,i've been in (sliding scale) therapy for a year and a half and am pretty sure i suffer from GAD.
191,"while therapy helped a little, i am starting to realize that it would be great to get a proper evaluation and try out some meds."
192,"i recently moved to a new (small) town, so i am no longer seeing the same therapist, and i don't have health insurance."
193,"i've looked into community resources, but i haven't come across one that offers anything besides therapy."
194,my psychotherapist said that sometimes they do help but she advises against it because the effect can also worsen my condition.
195,"What can I do, besides probably seeing a therapist?"
196,"One in fact, encouraged me to talk to a therapist."
197,My therapist has recently asked me to start spending 30mins a day writing about my worst case thoughts etc after i did a worry diary which seemed to help quite a bit with my GAD.
198,But I don't want to take medications and I don't want to see a therapist and she doesn't want to pay for it or have to drive me to a therapist so I'm not going.
199,"I can only imagine a therapist meeting where, oh, I feel better and not being able to take anything away from it because I'm not a serious case."
200,I went to a therapist a few times and he said it's nothing serious nor abnormal.
201,"I wanted to try writing as a therapy, as I won't have much time to see a therapist until probably the summer, so this is my coping mechanism in the meantime."
202,"Girlfriend is leaving me because she can't ""be there for me"" through this positive process of change and growth I'm going through due to therapy and medication."
203,"I just posted my short life story here on another post but I wanted to start this one to be more specific, here is a brief summery of my anxiety/depression :

It took YEARS (nearly a decade) to find a good therapist/psychologist combo to diagnose me correctly."
204,"I finally found a medication and therapist  that works for me (the combo was a complete game changer), my life is 10 fold better and I know many of the triggers that can kick in this anxiety so I can avoid them."
205,"I'm not really looking for answers, I already have a therapist, but I just needed to share."
206,"Any one know if it is possible to just give myself therapy in a way, or just get rid of it some how without a doctor?"
207,I've tried to tell him he needs to go to therapy and get medication but he refuses to even entertain the idea.
208,"After trying three meds, my doctor decided to tell me I need to talk to a therapist about the problem and that she would not be able to help me further."
209,She told me to talk to a therapist a year ago.
210,I went back to the doctor today for an unrelated illness and mentioned that I have not been able to call the therapist and was damn near accosted for not having done so and then she begrudgingly prescribed me a new medicine with the requirement that I come back to her in 30 days and having talked to a therapist.
211,I do not feel like I can at all call the therapist and I just don't know what to do.
212,What if therapy doesn't work?
213,"I'm going in today for a therapy session, and then am being diagnosed soon and put on medication soon after that."
214,"I talked to my therapist about long term care, or at least something more than an appointment every two or three weeks and he said I didn't need it."
215,"I think I'm going to bring it up with my therapist, but I just wanted to see if anyone else had any similar experiences to share."
216,"The current plan is to lower my anxiety enough to learn how to cope better, get more out of therapy, etc; I do not know if I'll want to stay on it, however."
217,I also really can't afford a therapist and I have doubts that a therapist would do me a solid amount of good; I've seen therapists before for unrelated issues and I was never able to connect or fully trust them.
218,"I'm going back to my therapist in a couple of weeks, but I need temporary sanity."
219,"I have  a therapist, but my sessions with her revolve around lots of things and I don't get enough time really."
220,I can now make appointments with therapists and coffee dates with friends and actually show up.
221,"I can take recommendations of therapists for activities that will help me to work through some of my ""stuff""."
222,I have begun taking Zoloft and seeing a therapist.
223,"They discouraged me from seeing a therapist/taking meds, but this isn't about them, this is about me."
224,"I am planning to tell my therapist this story tomorrow, as if I am actually going crazy, he would be the one that knows right?"
225,I've tried EMDR therapy (after a car accident as a way of dealing with my PTSD) which did nothing.
226,Along with therapy I started meditation (mindfulness) about 2 months ago in hope to eventually cure my anxiety.
227,I have health insurance that covers what I would need to see someone about therapy or medication.
228,"And then, this past year and a half or so, I started pushing myself, with the help of my therapist, to get back out of the house and being around people."
229,I'he spent many years miserable..I recently started therapy for the first time and I feel like I'm actually making breakthroughs.
230,"For God's sake, I didn't even tell my therapist about it because I was afraid she'd think I was complaining."
231,"I know this did not happen on its own, I did years of therapy, studying, and medications (I am no longer on.)"
232,"When your thoughts hurt, you see a therapist."
233,"This is something a therapist can help, right?"
234,Is there a way I can find out if the therapist is a good one?
235,"Sounds absolutely ridiculous when I type it out, thought this pseudo-therapy could help someone else out too :)"
236,"I never ever thought I would be able to do this (scared, wasting therapist's time, etc) but today the psychologist told me: I have to stop feeling bad for trying to improve my life."
237,To anyone putting off appointments or therapy: you can do it!
238,"Drugs help and so.does a good therapist

7."
239,"A list:

colonoscopy

endoscopy

various bloodworks (too many to count, really)

urologist x 3

cat scan

therapist

chest xrays

I have panic disorder and depression and general anxiety ...

what's going on recently is I have proteinuria, and my urolgist is sending me to a nephrologist in August, so I'm nervous about that."
240,Foundation of my therapy was samatha and vipassana meditation + cognitive behavioral therapy rather than taking meds.
241,Went through therapy and was taking an SSRI that gave me good results.
242,I am confident and hopeful that returning to my medication and potentially going back to therapy will help me get back into recovery.
243,I see a therapist and psychiatrist every month and take my daily medications every morning.
244,"I feel like i have the right tools through therapy and medication to stop the anxiety/panic but it just steam rolls over me.I try to read, go for a walk, talk to someone but it feels like if a panic attack wants to get me, its going to get me."
245,"I have a therapist and she's understanding (plenty of other therapists I've had haven't been but this one is), but I still don't find therapy helpful and never have."
246,"The most common advice I see here is ""find a therapist"", ""find a psychiatrist"", ""it's just anxiety"", and generally to deal with the *thoughts* first."
247,"I need help, therapy doesn't help me, but what does help."
248,"I've emailed some therapists today, asking if they have time for appointments but it's a Friday and most have long waiting times."
249,"She is on medication, something along the lines of Prozac, and seeing therapy but I don't think she is completely honest with the therapist."
250,"Finally, though, after two years of therapy I feel like I can finish my shifts without becoming so overwhelmed that I leave or no call-no show."
251,"I know it isn't much, and I still have a lot of therapy and tools to learn, but for me this is a great accomplishment."
252,"Now I don't like psych meds and I don't like homone replacement therapy, so I started doing some research on my own."
253,I'm still going to therapy.
254,"I'm on meds, I've tried a million different types, I've been through countless hours of therapy and was even inpatient once in the hospital for behavioral health."
255,"See, before I can be given the ""okay"" to go on hormone replacement therapy, (basically I would rub testosterone-rich gel on my shoulders every morning) I need to have bloodwork done."
256,"So after having a ""relapse"" in my anxiety last week, I'm back in my university provided therapy."
257,"However, I have talked about my therapist about the possibility of going on medication."
258,"However, I've never really been to any kind of individual or group cognitive therapy."
259,"I'm a student of psychology at university and, particularly lately, studies have shown that cognitive therapy can be equally, if not more, effective as medication."
260,I saw a therapist but only one visit because I am shy.
261,"So basically, i've tried therapy and it doesn't help."
262,"I talked to my boss and HR; thankfully they are giving me a chance, and I started therapy."
263,i've since started self-therapy and it's amazing the difference is when you finally start to love your self image.
264,"But, with the help of a good therapist, support from my husband and as much hard work as I could muster, I got a lot better."
265,Do I need therapy?
266,"I haven't been to a therapist yet, but I've been thinking about it lately, because just when my anxiety seems to get better, it starts getting worse and worse."
267,"But to give him and *myself* a piece of mind, I've been thinking about going to therapy and asking for medication."
268,I have to get some kind of medicine or see some kind of therapist because my life is being controlled by this.
269,"I am in my third round of anxiety therapy, which hasn't seemed to work well in the past."
270,I feel like I'm being misunderstood in therapy and in my sessions with my pill doctor (not sure what her title is?).
271,I'm in a therapy right now and I can handle most of my problems and my depression is gone.
272,My therapist doesn't gives me any advices.
273,I saw a psychiatrist today to discuss complimenting my therapy with an SSRI.
274,The idea is to make my therapy more effective and make it easier for myself to move forward in life at a faster pace.
275,I also don't have a lot of money to try to pay for therapy or medication.
276,"I know all about the best sorts of therapy, breathing ect."
277,"I went through a week long 8 hour group therapy session for attempting to commit suicide over a year ago, but none of the techniques are helping the pain of anxiety in my head and belly and my racing thoughts."
278,"Following two years of CBT therapy, and countless hours of reflection, this is how I feel now."
279,"I take 80mg strattera, and 150mg welbutrin, and I see a therapist 4 times a month."
280,"I'm not on xanax or the other medication thats for anxiety (I'm really sorry I'm such a noob at this, the meds that start with a C) and I'm trying to get an appointment with my psychiatrist and a therapist, but I really hate relying on meds to be ""okay""  

I feel really weak and pathetic because I need almost constant reassurance that things will be okay eventually"
281,The therapist lady was a bitch it came to the point that we just had to tell her everything was perfectly fine to not have to see her anymore.
282,I basically just sat there while my heart rate was getting faster and faster until suddenly i felt this terrible terrible feeling in my head like i was having a stroke or my head was exploding and i thought i was dying and i started freaking out and ended up going to the hospital again where the doctor brought up anxiety/panic attacks and since i had been there before about a year ago without anything showing up i was discharged with instructions to see a therapist.
283,Then this morning i had a doctors appointment with my family doctor just to get advice about everything and maybe some suggestions for therapist and to make sure it was actually anxiety/panic.
284,i don't know how a therapist will help since my thoughts seem to have no effect on my body or my mood or how i feel.
285,I've seen about 3 doctors and a therapist in the last five years.
286,A recent suggestion by my therapist was to try and put myself in situations that trigger my anxiety but while having thr safety net of escaping if I need to so I can become more comfortable in those situations and understand I have more control than I think.
287,"Please help me, just share your good experiances with therapy so that I can convince myself :) love you guys!"
288,I also have a therapist and see her once a week.
289,"I already regularly practice meditation and other anxiety reduction techniques from my counseling, and try more alternative things like aromatherapy and some over the counter natural anxiety remedies, and while it helps a little big, I'm just counting down the days until I have insurance again."
290,I've seen four therapists in my lifetime.
291,Stick with your therapist.
292,"Only recently did my therapist tell me to treat my anxiety/OCD as the ""other""; an ugly creature that was not a part of my being, but just an unwanted passenger I had to kick out of the car."
293,"I have visited a couple of different therapists over the past few years, but I now dread leaving the house and feel like I can't leave, so that leaves me in an interesting and pretty crappy position."
294,My therapist is going to be calling back in a few minutes with an idea about a mediator who visits my home and provides therapy here until I can go back to regular visits.
295,I'm so miserable because of anxiety...I just want my therapist.
296,I will eventually ask my therapist (when I stop being scared of her lol) about having an ESA.
297,"Alternative ideas such as meditation, yoga and other forms of therapy can curb the problems a little, but I'm still reluctantly stuck on benzos or the like."
298,"I have never seen a psychotherapist before, only counsellors back in the UK."
299,Am I overreacting or being unreasonable in wanting to see a different therapist now?
300,okay so i've been seeing my therapist for years and she is honestly the most genuine person ever.
301,"My therapist last night told me the residual effects of these things can manifest itself into disorders, such as this."
302,"Yesterday I know realized I took three - trouble sleeping, stressful day, exposure therapy."
303,"While I was away she realized she could get help, but her family can't afford to for her to get therapy."
304,It doesn't help that she doesn't think therapy would even help.
305,"I'm not sure what - therapy, counseling, medications, whatever ..."
306,Do I just pick a psychiatrist/psychologist off the list provided by my insurance and contact the therapist directly?
307,"At this point, I began therapy."
308,"A month or so into therapy, I met someone through friends."
309,"it's an entire other story), and my therapy eventually became about this girl and what to do."
310,"I went to visit a psychologists last tuesday for the first time ever, and she said something that we are going to start with something called ""cognitive therapy""."
311,"Like, what if something wrong happens in my brain, and I suddenly find like it's a good idea to jump off a cliff or something, when the therapy is over?"
312,"I've discussed this issue with a therapist that I typically see for other reasons, but the origin of my fears seems difficult to trace, or at least is somewhat irrational, although understandable."
313,"Along with personality changes I've had to stop going to school because I was unable to handle the stress of university, so I've been working well seeking therapy to get my anxiety under control."
314,"I've already done therapy for a big portion of my life, and even got admitted into a behavioral hospital."
315,"I've been seeing a therapist for awhile at a clinic, and she recommended seeing the resident Psychiatrist to get meds, so today I finally went."
316,I've been in therapy for close to two years for anxiety and depression.
317,"i figured it'd be best to do it in front of his therapist, for disaster containment purposes."
318,"Her mom, a massage therapist, worked on my neck pretty well and I'm sure she would've discovered anything."
319,My psychological health has noticeably increased via a regimen of Prozac and talk therapy.
320,I should try non-med therapy?
321,I also have meetings with an counselor/therapist every two weeks with another appointment soon of that's any help.
322,Their advice is confused and the therapy I've had just tells me something along the lines of letting him go and moving on with my life without helping him.
323,This then lead to a group therapy session.
324,"Today, I actually got the ball rolling on me going to therapy which was a big step."
325,"I told him that I'm starting therapy and he called what I said the other night ""a high overreaction, inappropriate, and unneeded."""
326,"Despite feeling absolutely miserable, I am glad that I'll be starting therapy soon."
327,"And I guess this is my first serious bout of anxiety since last Friday when my therapist told me I have OCD and I've been thinking about it all the time, and I haven't told my parents yet."
328,"My therapist tells me that the problem is my fear over really putting myself in this new relationship and really committing myself (not commitment in the relationship sense, he means more my intentions towards her)."
329,"I try to do all the stuff I'm supposed to do to calm myself and change my thinking (therapy, changing self talk, mindfulness, meditation, medication, exercise, etc.)."
330,"That goes double for anybody who has gotten therapy for Relationship-based OCD, which matches a lot of what I'm talking about."
331,"I'm in therapy, but only for two more weeks."
332,It feels like I've spent an eternity wallowing in my own emotional filth and telling myself I'm too good for therapy or that I don't need it.
333,I know that therapy is not a magic bullet but it is finally time I talked to somebody besides the internet about all of the strange things that go on inside my head.
334,"Reddit is generally not a place I go to for mental help, but I'm currently in the process of moving back in with parents just to move back to my current city in a month, so I'm waiting to put myself back into therapy until my living situation is stable again."
335,I can do that when I go back to therapy.
336,"I tried to get help, but I was unable to work through it because I felt my therapist wasn't doing much but let me ramble on and on about my life, never really giving me direction as to remedies or help in gaining control over the anxiety."
337,I've been in therapy off and on for many years now.
338,I've been in steady therapy for the past 3 years with periods of intensive therapy (2-3 sessions a week).
339,It's to the point where I'm ashamed to even admit how bad it is with my therapist.
340,"Part of me really doesn't want to, but another part knows this isn't going away even with the therapy so what alternatives are there?"
341,I've been sick for 4 years now put currently go to a therapist and I'm wondering if I'ts normal to feel sick with anxiety?
342,"In the end if nothing works dont be afraid of getting medical help, even if drug therapy is a definite option."
343,I've had terrible pill pushing doctors and psychiatrists and therapists and social workers.
344,"I was upset because I remembered the autistic (low functioning, regressive meaning he forgot how to do almost all basic skills) guy I used to live with in a group home used to scream at me everyday and how his brother told me he got shock therapy."
345,I'm in therapy for a lot of issues and am getting some help there.
346,"My therapist has been reminding me that it's okay if they say no, but that I have a good chance of getting accepted due to other things I've done."
347,"It's only been a very short time but im excited to see where i am in a month, Im determined to also start therapy and seeing psychologists and psychiatrists to help me with my issues as i want genuine progress and make."
348,"I'm 24yo and don't have many things to do this summer, i want to do an interrail now that my anxiety is better, but none of my friends want to come with me since they have no money or simply don't want to, so i decided i could/should go alone, my parents and therapist are very supportive but now that i have come to realize i was traveling alone for three weeks my anxiety spikes up and i feel overwhelmed with fear because of what i would go through if i decide to make this trip, i know it would be very good for me since i always lived with my parents and never traveled alone, i don't know what i'm looking for here, maybe some advice or people with similar experiences who traveled alone."
349,"In 2012, I went and saw my first therapist, but the lady was a moron and I quickly realized I was wasting $150 per session."
350,"I've been re-reading all the posts on this subreddit about driving tests and all the advice people have given, and my therapist helped a lot to help me calm down and work through my anxiety!"
351,The suggestions provided here are not explicitly medical advice and are not intended to replace psychotherapy treatment.
352,At first I only used Xanax (prescribed .5 mg as needed) to control my panic attacks but I can handle those due to therapy nowadays and they are not nearly as common as they used to be.
353,"Everyday I seem to end up in a tailspin of procrastination behaviors, like cleaning week-old dishes, finally vacuuming, digging up old projects I never finished, and of course retail therapy."
354,"I haven't gone to therapy in a couple years because my coping methods typically work, but with the stress of divorce, job loss, and education I think it might be time to see someone."
355,I have never been officially diagnosed but I tried out a few meds from a doctor with no luck a few years ago and tried a therapist.
356,I was very reluctant with the therapist then and it didn't do any good.
357,"I want to try seeing a therapist again to deal with my anxiety, but I am afraid what I said in session will get out."
358,"If I ever have kids or divorced or anything, the last thing I want is my therapist subpeonad and then forced to discuss how I am anxious, fearful and all other negative issues that I tell him."
359,Can any therapist elaborate on what I can do or what a subpeona would force the therapist to do?
360,I did a therapy and got daily medication (which I still take today).
361,The therapy was one year and ended two years back.
362,"I am older than I should be, I am living in my parent's basement, i've been through years of therapy and I am back in school."
363,"I was forced to run away from home, go through intensive therapy, and now I am slowly but surely learning how to take care of myself by working a full time minimum wage job and living with my boyfriend in a apartment we pay for together."
364,"I went to the hospital and got a prescription for Atosil, got on a waiting list for a therapist and got enrolled in a sport therapy class daily."
365,I'm seeing a therapist every other week and group therapy the other weeks and being medicated for it on top of that.
366,"I've been doing really great I think in overcoming my anxiety - I successfully got off of the 40mg of celexa I had been taking daily for nearly 15 years, finished a round of CBT therapy with an amazing therapist who saw a tremendous change in me, took up meditation and mindfulness (albeit at the very newbie level), recognized and realized that exercise and eating healthy is a huge contributor to my mental feelings, and have had an amazing boyfriend supporting me through the whole thing."
367,I know this doesn't take the place of a therapist or actual counsellor but it would be nice to hear some opinions.
368,My therapist and doctor just keep giving me SSRIs which I promptly throw in the garbage when I get home because they make life a living nightmare of indifference and melancholia.
369,"They've gotten him the therapy he wanted, and just many other things."
370,"You see a psych once each week, and a therapist 3 times each week."
371,"Also, I see a therapist each week, but today will only be my second appointment (I only started to see her once things got bad... shit move on my part, I know) so I don't know how much help that will be."
372,"Okay, so now after my ginormous wall of text with my life history, my question is, since I'm feeling a bit better, should I not go through with that intensive therapy?"
373,"It seems like it might be overkill now, but somehow the weekly therapy and monthly psych visits don't feel like they will be enough."
374,Three weeks ago I started cognitive behavioral therapy after a year of procrastinating and reluctant to start.
375,"I'm not saying everyone will have the same results in only 3 weeks, but if you're feeling trapped, anxious, frightened, please get therapy or counseling."
376,"I see my therapist tomorrow and my psychiatrist Friday, thank God."
377,"I've never taken medication for my anxiety before (just therapy for coping mechanisms, it was very helpful overall) but I'm really considering making an appointment for that purpose, because I think my fear of losing this job may just turn into a self-fulfilling prophesy soon."
378,I finally agreed to see a therapist to help me through my anxiety.
379,The therapist basically told me to do what I was already doing.
380,The reason I'm asking is because I just entered an Outpatient Intensive Care program that's 6 hours of group therapy.
381,"If I ""assume"" with insurance (I have) therapy is 25$ per session (it could be more), I would be left with $170 for variance  for a month."
382,Every time I talk about this with my therapist I cry.
383,Ive been on meds of ADHD since I was in the 3rd grade and have been to therapy once before for masochism and anxiety.
384,I then spent the rest of the week coming down from that and recovering - missing my therapy appointment on Tuesday as well as all of my classes.
385,"Grabbing the first note book I can find, breathing deep, examining my fear (just like my therapist and I had practiced), I walked out the door."
386,"I've been suffering for as long as I can remember, and have gone through countless therapists."
387,"The last two therapists, I've learned, were somewhat amateur and didn't specialize in anything other than ""therapy"" (mind you, they had their M.D.s, I just never felt like they provided me with the counsel I felt I needed.)"
388,"TL;DR: But a question I can't quite ask my therapist, and felt like asking you, was what helped you/allowed you/made you know that your therapist is going to be beneficial?"
389,Last week I finally told my therapist and doctor that I was having panic attacks thinking about driving.
390,"As of yesterday, back on therapy, and meds (I hate that I'm on them, but we dicussed that they are for short term.)"
391,"I've gone to a number of different therapists and what not, but nothing they say ever just clicks."
392,I'm on a waiting list for therapy but I'd like to do what I can in the meantime.
393,The problem is  my parents don't support therapy for me right now.
394,"I'm kind of scared to talk to my family or friends about it because they all think I'm a pretty well adjusted, happy person....and I don't want to blind side them with something crazy like this and freak them out......I feel like I need to go to a therapist and maybe get medication or something."
395,"I know you guys aren't supposed to be therapists or anything, but I just wanted to share and maybe get some advice."
396,Today I had a really productive talk with my therapist and I think I found some good advice that I would like to share.
397,I see a therapist once a week and I like just talking him because I'm worried about burdening my family/friends.
398,I'm going to my therapist tomorrow and I'm going to talk to him about all of this (I actually wrote a note in my iPhone so I'd remember how I felt when this was happening) but I just feel like everything is my fault.
399,I do undergo therapy which is quite helpful.)
400,This has been going on consistently through therapy and various anxiety medications for essentially as long as I can remember.
401,"I've been able to work through the majority of my anxiety through therapy, but this particular problem seems to be lingering."
402,"I also tried seeing a therapist, who after about 2 sessions basically began to send me away after about 20 minutes, claiming that there was nothing else to talk about during the session."
403,"I ended up leaving that therapist after about 3 or 4 sessions- it was worthless, she didn't think I needed the help I was looking for."
404,"I began seeing a therapist, in addition to the psychiatrist, and she has me doing CBT."
405,Being hypnotized by my therapist as a treatment for anxiety.
406,"I have been anti-pharmaceuticals and have been using exercise, diet, and cognitive-behavioral therapy which had good (but not great) results in controlling my anxiety."
407,My therapist advised Ativan on an 'as needed' basis but have never used it.
408,"If taking her to the doctor or seeing a therapist were a liable option, I wouldn't be here typing this thread."
409,"I was able to control it after only a few therapist visits, but just last summer, with my mothers cancer becoming worse, and the stress of college, my PTSD came roaring back into focus into my life."
410,"I am seeing a therapist, and it has slightly helped, but I just feel like my overall condition seems to be worsening."
411,I tore a ligament and i need 6 weeks to recover and then i need to go to physical therapy.
412,I have been seeing a therapist for a few months and about a week ago I met with a psychiatrist who put me on zoloft and neurontin.
413,TL;DR when do signs and symptoms of anxiety start to fade with combined therapy and medication?
414,"I'm guessing it depends on the psychiatrist, but I'd like to ask if anyone here is seeing a psychiatrist to receive medication and not for psychiatric therapy and if so how often are the follow-ups?"
415,"I've never been helped by therapy or anything else like that, so my improvements have all been largely trial-and-error, and I'd like to help others skip all that."
416,I might also look into therapy but I need to research that I bit.
417,"I started seeing a therapist last week, and I think it will help."
418,Since I've been journaling and reading and seeing the therapist.
419,"I attended 2 counseling sessions with a  ""sex therapist"" that did absolutely nothing for me."
420,"I attended numerous therapy sessions with a general family psychiatrist, which helped clear a lot of demons but had yet to solve my intimacy issue."
421,"After therapy, courage and time, I overcame and know that anything is now possible."
422,"I have always had extreme muscle tension, and while getting the only two professional massages I've ever had, the massage therapists told me they've never worked with anyone so tense."
423,"After it started getting in the way of life in general I sought help through my health care provider in the form of therapy, attending an ""anxiety clinic"", and being put on various SSRIs and benzos to help curb the general anxiety and panic attacks."
424,"I'm still in therapy ... and it's a nice place to express my thoughts and I find it insightful, however I just can't make ""talking"" about and ""rationalizing"" these worries and illogical thoughts remove the constant association of anxiety and severe panic that come along with the thoughts merely entering my head."
425,"I'm glad that I'll be able to catch up on school work and actually graduate on time but I'm afraid that I won't have any social interaction anymore, I only leave my house for school and therapy as it is, and I'm just really scared."
426,"This new job comes with a new schedule, which means I won't be able to see my current therapist anymore most likely (we're supposed to talk next week, but it was already a stretch to get her to come in when my current job gave me an earlier shift, and I'm pretty much positive there just won't be time to make it there before or after work)."
427,I've made progress with my current therapist and it's just awful to have to think about having to find myself another one.
428,I just started seeing a therapist 2 weeks ago and have my third session tomorrow.
429,I tried therapy but didn't really get much out of it.
430,I have recently figured out that I have GAD and am seeing a therapist for it.
431,"I have been in therapy for about a year and a half for 'maintenance' but for the most part, my anxiety stems from an unhealthy fear of death."
432,"I have an appointment on friday with my psych, maybe I need to start going to therapy too anyway."
433,"I've also started talk therapy, but it doesn't seem to be helping with anxiety."
434,"I've always been afraid of death, and it's something I'm working on with my therapist, but I can't shake this current terror, and I don't know what I'm going to do."
435,That way I can also continue to work on it with my therapist and hopefully be off of the meds sooner.
436,"I'm going to think this over and also talk to my therapist, but I wanted to see if you all had any experiences or input to share."
437,What is therapy like?
438,This really is a nice bit of therapy.
439,I've been in therapy but I always refused medication when it was suggested.
440,These animals are my therapy.
441,I can't afford therapy and I can't afford anything but Anxiety medications from my general dr and they just make it SO MUCH WORSE!
442,"I told her I wanted to go through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, not be on any long term medication after she tried pushing an SSRI on me, and even after me telling her this, she prescribed this medication ""just to take the edge off while I'm doing the therapy."""
443,I've seen a couple of therapists who have basically said I will have to just learn to live with it.
444,"My new insurance sucks and doesn't cover psych, so my therapist had offered to keep going by just paying her my copay."
445,"I am/was working with a therapist that my parents are tied to my anxiety, and it has helped."
446,"I hated it, taking it made me feel like I wasn't human, along with the two sessions of therapy a week."
447,"My friends all said that it wasn't healthy to mess with my medication and constantly be going on and off, but none of them had any problems (or so I had thought), medication, therapists, so I would get in arguments and have breakdowns."
448,"My eyes were steadily getting worse, and I was getting extra sessions of therapy and suggested a support group to prepare me for the day I would wake up to a world of grey."
449,"For a while now, I've felt like I need to see a therapist for several reasons."
450,"I already have been to therapy for this (court-ordered ""drug counseling"", but we treated it more like therapy because it was obvious I'm not addicted to anything), and that definitely helped me out a little, but the thoughts still persist."
451,"So here I am now, recently off of Lexapro because I hated it, and in therapy to figure things out and try to get better with communication towards them, because I hardly say a word when they talk to me now."
452,I also visited a drop-in therapist yesterday through my college and literally just sat in an office with a stranger and cried uncontrollably for 2 hours.
453,"It seems like I've learned to control that better now - thanks to meds, therapy, and my girlfriend."
454,"She has tried therapy in the past but never ""buys into it"" (her words)."
455,"She refuses to try medication and never did the ""homework"" given to her by her therapists (ie."
456,"I am in therapy &amp; on medications, and have recently been reading about Buddhism, since I need something more."
457,She has and an IEP at school for therapy.
458,She sees a therapist and the counselor at school and no one has been able to figure this out.
459,"I've been employing a combination of CBT (with an amazing therapist my equally-amazing GP recommended) and low-dose alprazolam and, finally, went to the doctor last Thursday."
460,Went back to my therapist the following Monday and told her all about it - she was overjoyed for me.
461,"I expressed concern that despite going through her deep-relaxation exercise both at home and in the waiting room, and having taken a Xanax in between, that I was still anxious in the doctor's office, but she said that a big part of therapy is moving away from black &amp; white thinking."
462,"Still seeing my therapist and occasionally using the Xanax for other ongoing anxiety matters, but this one I can definitely say has improved drastically."
463,"I'm happy to give people the names of my doctors (GP, therapist, psychiatrist) if you want - just PM me."
464,"I know everyone responds to different forms of treatment differently, but what I hoped to convey was that even the thickest fog can be seen through if you find the right treatments, and you can do that if you commit to it and level with your doctors/therapists, saying ""I want this to work, I don't know if it will, and can you help me find something that does if this doesn't?"""
465,"I go to therapy, and I take psych meds for my anxiety and other mental illness but I also drink passion flower tea and it helps when my anxiety is so bad that my body just feels ""off""."
466,"I want to know if I should get a therapist to cure my fears, anxiety,and social/self-hatred issues."
467,I'm also scared of paying hundreds of dollars for a therapist.
468,I can barely afford to put gas in my car let alone drop hundreds for a therapist.
469,For clarification on my medical background in case you're wondering: I've never been diagnosed with any mental health issue before and I've never gone to a therapist.
470,"Edit: As well, I'm 22 and no longer taking medication or attending therapy."
471,"I've started taking 200mg per day (from a week ago) and made some other positive changes too - I've been seeing a therapist for just over a year and things have slowly improved over time, I started exercising about a week ago, I've written a list of the things I'd do if I didn't have anxiety, and my next step is to make another list of activities I can do to slowly attack it."
472,"But I would really like to hear from people with a therapy animal if possible, and the pros and cons they have encountered."
473,"I met with a therapist for 2 years at school, but she a)."
474,What's the point of having a therapist who is mentally incomplex.
475,"I have an appointment in November to see a therapist, so hopefully they can help me with all of my issues, but even that is anxiety-inducing."
476,"I saw my therapist today and I just left, well I'm feeling pretty anxious."
477,"I try using some stuff I learned from an ""Emotion Regulation"" group therapy class over summer, but after a certain point it's like I have no more control over my own body and I just watch everything start going out of control."
478,I'm going to start a therapy for chronic suicidal ideation soon if everything goes right.
479,It will be an intense short term therapy but I need to start somewhere.
480,"I want to seek help from a therapist, but the thing that makes me most anxious is the thought of seeing one..."
481,The abuse got to the point where I was in and out of therapy because I just couldn't function at all ... but then we ran out of money and had no insurance.
482,"I got comfortable trying to talk to a therapist, and then I was sat down by my father and told I couldn't go back."
483,"Hi /r/anxiety,

I've got an appointment with my therapist tomorrow, but I need to vent because I'm freaking out."
484,I thought it might be a muslce knot or something but my massage therapist friend couldnt find one.
485,"I should also mention that his job doesn't provide health insurance so as far as I know, he's unmedicated and not seeing a therapist so whatever he's dealing with, he's likely doing it alone."
486,He explained to me that I was someone who might benefit from therapy and exercise but invited me to accept a prescription for an anti-depressant because of the level of stress I live with.
487,"I am working with my insurance to start seeing a therapist ASAP, but I just need some tips on how to get by until then."
488,"Oh, did I mention I'm training to be a psychotherapist?"
489,"Through drug treatment and continual therapy I know it will, but over a decade of feeling anxious about most things, panic attacks, and deepening depression will not be fixed quickly."
490,"He enjoys aromatherapy items, especially candles and incense."
491,"I have taken so many antidepressants, done non-drug therapy, and nothing has worked for the past 25+ years."
492,"This was arrived at after the failure of the therapies above, along with the fact that of all the symptoms of panic attacks, I only have 1, and the list is long."
493,"I was in therapy (cognitive behavioral, no meds) for around a year but haven't been seeing anyone recently."
494,"I've contacted my grad school's free counseling, but the last time I was there I was referred out, and I don't have insurance that covers normal therapists."
495,"I was entirely unaware of how bad my agoraphobia and anxiety had gotten since I left in mainly untreated, so I took this semester off to go to therapy and get my head straight."
496,The latest news is that my therapist moved away and that the University nearby won't let me attend again because of money I owe them.
497,I got a therapist this month.
498,"I know this isn't healthy but I don't think there's any way she's ever going to be able to totally understand, and I'm sick of making her be my therapist."
499,"And I need to make those presentations, and I need to go to my therapist tonight, but I just want to cry and eat brownie...."
500,I am currently seeing a therapist.
501,"I talk to a therapist, but I don't get that same feeling I guess."
502,I told my therapist I didn't want to up my medication (10mg lexapro) until this term is over.
503,"I have 2 months until the course, 2 months to entirely stop the medication, 2 months to improve myself as a person and 2 months to decrease my anxiety by doing exposure type therapy, good luck to you all with anxiety, i wish you all luck, anxiety is such a motherfucker but the fact that you are seeking help simply by looking on this forum means you are TRYING."
504,"i currently don't have health insurance so meds/therapy are out of the picture, and i would much rather use techniques and natural methods to help my situation."
505,I started going to therapy (for the first time) a little over a year ago.
506,"That being said, I don't feel like my therapist has actively given me tools to deal with the situations I want to change/fix."
507,"I'm really looking for my therapist to coach me by saying: ""If ABC happens, try doing XYZ instead of what you normally do."""
508,Are there therapists who operate in this manner?
509,The thoughts I am writing here have not been discussed with my therapist.
510,"I'm a little nervous to bring it up -- which is me being non-confrontational, of course -- but I'm really looking for other people to chime in about how their therapy sessions work."
511,"I kind of felt like those books taught me just as much, if not more, than my therapist about some of my relationships."
512,"I was confused -- was I supposed to feel a sense of relief that I had come across these books (partly because I was now in a different state of mind being in therapy), or should I have been frustrated/angry that those monumental realizations had little to do with my therapist/therapy sessions?"
513,"Again, this is something I did not bring up with my therapist..."
514,"I've been in therapy for 4 years now and I don't trust my current therapist, but I have no way of finding another one - he's literally the only one in this backwater town that was able to take me, and that's after a long-ass waiting list (I was placed on 3 waiting lists and his was the only one that cleared up)."
515,Every week for therapy I am late because of my dad.
516,I've been off my meds for a few weeks because I haven't been able to get an appointment with my doctor and I haven't seen my therapist in months.
517,"Have a therapist appointment (first one) next week, so hopefully I can last until then."
518,"It just goes to show that sometimes hard work, a good support system, a therapist, and medication (looking at you Xanax &amp; Wellbutrin) can get you through even the darkest of days."
519,"I don't know who to go to, I've called over 100 therapists in te past 6 months and none seem likethey can help."
520,"It's been a month and a half and (after moving back home due to panic attacks) I am living day to day with my cat, going to therapy, riding my bike, and taking a few online classes."
521,"Treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Northport generally includes prescription medications, often in combination with psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy."
522,"Better treatment options for anxiety in Northport include safer drugs that do not result in dependency, such as SSRIs; psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavior therapy; and neurofeedback therapy, an exciting treatment modality recently available in Northport that uses EEG biofeedback to identify and change brainwave dysregulation that underlies brain-based disorders such as generalized anxiety disorders."
523,I have been seeing a therapist and he is great but I just feel better for a few hours after a session then go right back to being a paranoid train wreck.
524,Though a therapist 'cured' me once and I ended up backpacking round Australia for a year on my own with 0 attacks which was amazing.
525,These two techniques came from the therapist I saw.
526,I'm waiting outside the door to my therapists office (it's locked no one there).
527,"Granted, I'm 5 minutes early and there is a culture of 'late' where I live but I'm having a flashback to the other time I waited at another therapists office for an hour, while no one was there, in the middle of a snow storm and finally went home crying."
528,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
529,I've done many therapies.
530,I thought it might be a muslce knot or something but my massage therapist friend couldnt find one.
531,This is my first time seeing a therapist and I'm not sure what to expect.
532,I am in therapy.
533,"I see a therapist weekly but I feel like I get nowhere without medications, and even then, I don't notice any progress."
534,About a month ago I started therapy with my old therapist from high school and it's going well.
535,I’m *not* looking for online therapy – I’m pursuing therapy separately – I’m just looking for advice.
536,"Throughout all those years though they always viewed it as a weakness, and eventually told me as a 15 year old that if I wanted to keep seeing my therapist I would have to pay for it out of my college savings."
537,"I would really like to try to resolve things within myself without drugs(at least at first), and the fact that this woman just threw some at me really put me off of therapy in general."
538,"On top of all that, I have recently come to the conclusion that I will need to find a ""sex positive"" therapist, since I am having a ton of unnecessary anxiety about the state of my sex life with my SO of 4 years."
539,I got a therapist.
540,"I told my therapist about her in august, my therapist urges me to tell my parents."
541,I'm off meds now and stopped seeing the therapist I saw for 4 years.
542,I'm in therapy but my therapist doesn't seem to be of much help with this.
543,I want to put it out there that I am currently seeking a talk therapist and I am medicated.
544,Just a note: I DO plan on visiting a doctor and finding a counsellor/therapist.
545,"He taught me all about cognitive behavioural therapy and I really began to think that anxiety played a large role in my profile, despite never being diagnosed."
546,"I didn't know I had GAD when I started going to therapy - I always just identified myself as ""an over thinker."""
547,"But I DID go to therapy for what I thought was Seasonal Affective Disorder (which it turns out I do experience), and through many conversations with my therapist have also realized that I also experience GAD."
548,"I don't know exactly what my point is other than the worst of my depression and anxiety have been experienced over the last couple years, and the decision to go to therapy has been one of the best things I've ever done."
549,"Since then I've been going to therapy and some groups, and I've improved quite a bit since (yay!)"
550,"My therapist told me that if my current therapy groups weren't fixing my anxiety, she would reccomend I take a mild antidepressant."
551,"I use aroma therapy, a heating pad for tension in my upper back, yoga, exercise."
552,"2) As stupid and useless as this question might seem, is there a chance I be able to partake in these activities after pharmaceutical and/or talk therapy?"
553,I really just want to know if it's worth the time and financial investment to go with the therapy route.
554,"he kind of sat there and acted like he was the therapist, and that he knew all my problems and where I was coming from, and tah dah!"
555,"I've been in therapy for years and have read a lot about strategies and such and it all makes sense in my head, but I just freeze up every damn time."
556,"I live in a busy town so getting into an actual therapist takes days, sometimes."
557,"I'm thinking having another avenue, in online therapy, might help in between these actual appointments...anyone have any stories or information they can share about online therapy?"
558,I recently acknowledged my anxiety and saw a therapist for the first time last week.
559,"I have a psychiatrist and therapist I see regularly, but I don't feel like I'm getting all that much help."
560,"I have a therapist that I go to and am thinking about changing my appointment for the day of, but I'm hoping I can get through this without doing that."
561,"I live in Canada so apparently therapy is free here, I just gotta get a doctor's referral so I was gonna go to a walk-in clinic with my buddy some time this week."
562,"Im 18, i started having anxiety when i was about 16 from there i went through a phase of zoloft and therapy that ended up quelling it."
563,I waned off both the meds and therapy only to find myself back drowning in it as soon as college started.
564,I'm gonna start looking for a therapist again but i just really wanted to write this out.
565,I've been trying to taper down on my diazepam dosing as a result of developing a bit of a dependence while waiting to get into therapy.
566,Ps: Has someone ever had a good advice from a therapist ??
567,"Things had been going really well for me, my therapy was going great and things were improving, and then my medical exemption ran out (meaning the government now expects me to start looking for work)."
568,She wouldn't give me an anti anxiety and set me up with cognitive behavioral therapy.
569,"I saw a therapist when I was 14, up until I was 18."
570,My doctor has prescribed my Citalopram which I started today and CBT therapy which I start next week.
571,"With therapy and medication, I've come to realize that those kinds of thoughts were caused by the anxiety, and were not an actual reflection of reality."
572,I saw a psychiatrist who gave me Xanax and told me to start therapy.
573,Is a therapist going to be able to help identify what's wrong with me?
574,"I know he is open to the idea of therapy, but hasn't started any self or outside help."
575,I also go to a therapist that has helped me with breathing exercises to calm down.
576,So ive been to a therapist or two before but those were when i was a kid and i had no idea what i was doing there.
577,"I'm a 30 y/o biology postdoc (woman), with a 10 y/o history of GAD and panic disorder (under treatment with .75 mg Xanax/2 die and 100 mg Venlafaxine HCl/die, no psychotherapy) and a past diagnosis of major depression (treated at the time with fluoxetine and psychotherapy)."
578,I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in two weeks to adjust the therapy to fit the rise in the basal levels of anxiety and the increase in the panic episodes.
579,"Meanwhile, Mum's sister has been diagnosed with depression and has been on therapy and medications."
580,But here's the problem - she will not see a therapist about it.
581,"When I suggested therapy, I was told I was being disloyal for agreeing with my Aunt."
582,I'm going to talk to a therapist in the coming days.
583,"* ·         Register at my local doctor  I did this one today, once my patient details are fully registered in their system I will book an appointment to speak to my GP about starting up my anxiety and depression therapy again and talk about the harm I’ve possibly done to my body through years of alcohol abuse and what I can do to ease the withdrawal."
584,I don't feel like I need therapy or meds on a general basis as I am still functional.
585,"I obviously need to see my therapist but when you guys are scared of going crazy, what reassures you that you won't snap?"
586,"It's not really a consistent enough problem for me to worry about, and I don't like therapy anyway, so I never really bother with it."
587,"I have been agoraphobic with panic disorder for 23 years (agoraphobic on and off, the last 6 years on) and although I do have a doctor for meds for anxiety, I have not had therapy in 7 years."
588,"Please help me, just share your good experiances with therapy so that I can convince myself :)
love you guys!"
589,"I wasn't doing great, but I was a bit better when I was on medication, seeing my doctor &amp; a therapist."
590,"To me, living through every day is exposure therapy."
591,all this happened when i started medication and therapy.
592,My therapist told me today that I seem to have a lot of anxiety and that needs to be a goal to work on understanding and decreasing it.
593,I started looking for therapists in my area that work on a sliding scale (income based).
594,"TL;DR Tried to get help for depression/suicidal thoughts, social anxiety kept me from communicating with the therapist."
595,"I have severe anxiety, not diagnosed, but I'm in therapy trying to figure out where it came from."
596,I have talked about this in therapy but not extensively yet.
597,&gt;Years of therapy when I was younger made all the difference in the world for me.
598,I wasn't as stressed and therapy alone taught me wonderful ways to combat my fears and actually live every day.
599,"They can help take away the brunt of the pain and anguish, leaving therapy and personal determination to deal with the rest."
600,"I will state that not everyone with a mental illness has access to either therapy or medications, which I believe is a crying shame."
601,And to find a secular therapist in this area who specializes in my type of illness and who works with our insurance.
602,I've had to make conscious efforts to use the almost forgotten techniques I learned in therapy all those years ago to calm myself down when the world starts to close in on me.
603,"i have no therapist to speak of, because they cost money, and i'm on a waiting list at the local human resources center."
604,"I’ve wanted to try therapy for a few years now but had no insurance to cover the expenses, despite being Canadian."
605,"Now they've given me a choice between being in a 12-week group therapy session, or going one-on-one with a therapist for 8-15 weeks."
606,"The drawback of the one-on-one therapy is that her trainee (therapist in training) HAS to be at every session, which I don't really like the idea of honestly."
607,"Needless to say, I’m anxious about a one-on-one (two technically) anxiety therapy program."
608,"I'm torn between the two therapy session choices, but my contact wants an answer by the end of the week."
609,"I kind of signed up for the treatment with the assumption that I’d be one-on-one with a therapist, but during the interview I was told that most people are placed in the group therapies because there’s just so many people and so few available slots for one-on-one therapy."
610,I began to warm up to the idea of group therapy given that everyone in the group will be people I relate to.
611,This makes me lean toward group therapy.
612,"But my contact said although both choices are good, and she thinks I’d do well in the group therapy too, apparently people improve faster in one-on-one sessions which are more personalized."
613,"But the one-on-one sessions could start right away, whereas the group sessions would begin in May, and I’d probably be done with therapy by the time that time if I went with the one-on-one."
614,"My family suggested I should try therapy so I will do that, starting this summer."
615,I talked to my husband about possibly seeing a therapist or psychiatrist again because I don't want to have an anxiety attack.
616,"I would look for a therapist, but I've had trouble before using my social security card (I'm in Europe) to get care, since I'm foreign and they apparently think I'm trying to cheat the system or something."
617,"I have tried therapy, medication etc."
618,"Hey guys just thought id like to vent my thoughts on what anxiety i have witch my g.p and therapist classify as Severe Anxiety which is a mix of all kinds of anxiety :Z the earliest time i can remember when it started was in year 6 when we had a multicultural day and had to parade around the school in monk costume, i was 10 at this time."
619,"everyday from there out till today id wake up and have crappy thoughts and feel crap, feel sick in the stomach and vomit and go to the toilet all the time ""Number 2"" on Saturday and Sunday i would fell amazing and normal so i always looked forward to it, however i did not seek help because i thought what i experienced everyday was normal as it runs in my family and my dad and his dad has it, other symptoms i get is freezing feet, always tired, horrible memory, horrible concentration, and always think something bad iss going to happen eg, house burn down :Z.

anyhow i am now 19 and seeing a therapist and started taking Paroxatine 14 days ago i have yet to see any improvement but i know medication takes time 6 weeks at least."
620,"i have come to terms that my anxiety will not go away i am just hoping that the medication at least aids in the severity of it, and the therapy gives me techniques on how to deal with it which therapy is all about."
621,I know I should see a therapist and I am working on doing that.
622,"The only problem is that I simply do not have time for therapy or any quality, long-term treatment."
623,I just don't want to visit a doctor and tell them I just want meds because I don't have time for therapy... That seems a little sketchy.
624,"**TL;DR I need to ""fix"" my anxiety, but I don't have the time/money for therapy."
625,Doing everything the therapist said and I've seen no result.
626,Now the therapist is talking about how CBT probably isn't for me and how I would respond better to a slower paced therapy.
627,The problem is that I can't afford a slower paced therapy.
628,But there isn't any other type of therapy available on the NHS.
629,"I can't  hold a job because of my anxiety, which means I can't earn money for the therapy that I need."
630,"I entered therapy about a year and some change ago, it's helping a little but I'm still honestly really struggling."
631,My social anxiety really destroyed my social life--I haven't been able to make any new friends since I started therapy because I'm pretty unreliable (I need lots of time alone to cope).
632,"I've been at therapy for a long time now and I'm considering changing therapists since I'm not really getting great results (in fact, I feel like my anxiety got WORSE after I entered therapy)."
633,A little back story: I have been in therapy for several years.
634,I started with student therapists who were available on a sliding scale.
635,These therapists were only available during the semester.
636,Afterward they left and I was given a new student therapist.
637,"I went through two student therapists before turning to a different place, also with a sliding scale."
638,I have had this therapist ever since and have even changed locations as she switched companies.
639,Initially I began therapy to get over some lingering issues I had growing up and specifically during middle school (a Soviet gulag which had been transported to the Midwest).
640,I started seeing my current therapist in order to deal with a freak out I was having over my codependency.
641,"Dealing with this means making a choice between ending therapy or going through the arduous trek of finding a new therapist and then, once chosen, going through the daunting process of having that therapist get to know and understand me."
642,"(I seem to have lost steam so I’m going to stop now…)

**TL;DR**
I found out my therapist is leaving in three weeks and I’m freaking out about it."
643,Btw I do go to therapy but maybe I should try something else?
644,My family and therapist are still really worried for me though.
645,I have tried psychotherapy that kinda worked for me but I can't afford it anymore.
646,I have seen multiple university therapists and a psychologist from a private practice to try and control my symptoms.
647,"In the short time I was on it, I was required to go to a therapist, (I ended up with two) I didn't eat or sleep."
648,A therapist?
649,Definitely going to bring this up to my therapist.
650,"I'm on several meds that should help and getting therapy, but I'm getting no relief."
651,"Medication didn't work, neither has therapy, and so I'm left wondering maybe I am just not cut out for this world."
652,Tried so many different therapies combined with different meds but nothing ever seemed to work.
653,"Disappointed my parents, coaches, and lots of people who looked up to me in not playing in the next level, mainly because i had so much anxiety (especially traveling anxiety; riding the bus, car trips), i began seeing a therapist but i was too immature to follow through with everything, and soon quit going."
654,"I scheduled myself to see the same therapist and plan to follow through on everything she says, yet i don't know if i should go back medication."
655,"I've seen the same therapist for three sessions and while I think he's a smart guy, he talks nonstop and I end up leaving sessions a bit bewildered and mentally fatigued."
656,"I've heard that you should give it time, but I also don't want to waste money... is it too soon to try to find a new therapist?"
657,They told me many times to go to therapy and I will try if I find a good therapist.
658,I constantly have to use the skills my therapist teaches me so I don't get anxiety attacks.
659,"Hey folks 

I was wondering if anyone could give me some tips, I trying my best to focus on the progress i made so far through therapy, yet last weekend and last night I had a bit of a set back 

to keep it brief my flatmate had some friends over (some of which i know) yet on both occasions i just stayed in my room and could not even bring my self to make even a short appearance; even just to say Hello 

This inability to talk to other people has made me feel like any progress i made so far is pretty much worthless, it's like i just barely climbed to the top of a mountain only to find that there's another one waiting for me 

i'm struggling to tell my self good things about myself with out thinking that i'm being some big headed egotistical jerk off 

I mean yeah people do seem to be genuinely happy to see me / have me around; but its like I cant see what they see 

I do realize that the feelings i have about my self are untrue; but i'm really struggling to switch my focus away from them 

(i'm really sorry, i know i said i'd keep it brief; guess that didn't quite work :-/ )

Guess my question is; how do you keep your focus on the good things ?"
660,"Yes, I smoke daily as it's my happy place routine and the nurse practitioner today wasn't thrilled, but the regular doctor and every damn therapist have advocated to stay on it as it helps me more than any pharma drug ever has."
661,"As for therapy, first few sessions are fine but then I begin tailoring my words to fit the therapist's perceived image of me and eventually I can't tell them what's wrong with me at all."
662,I've gone to a few therapists over the years and this always happens.
663,My therapist figured it was sort of like I removed the safety net that I grew up with.
664,I had a period of time where I barely slept and started going to therapy and taking Endep 10mg to help me sleep.
665,The therapy didn't do a lot and due to money issues/not feeling like the therapy was doing much I stopped going.
666,"I have tried meditation, breathing exercises, and therapy."
667,I think the therapy would benefit me greatly if it wasn't for my pride.
668,"I just booked my first new therapist in 2 years, as I could no longer afford $100 a visit and thought I was ok. Well I have a lot of crap going on, stress, anxiety, and a new diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder."
669,"I worry that my therapist will judge me if she's an older woman, just from past experiences."
670,"I just keep trying to plan out how to say what I need to say to feel better, this will be my 5th therapist, so I shouldnt feel so anxious about it, but I dont know what this place will be like and if the psychologist will take me seriously."
671,I haven't had the chance to start on any medications or therapy since I've been visiting my dad in another part of the country all summer.
672,"I went to therapy in the past and it isn't something I can afford right now, plus it wasn't overly effective for me."
673,My plan is to get some therapy and try to address my anxiety for the first time in my life.
674,I have also tried therapy for a year.
675,I don't think my therapist was very good since we were constantly trying to find things to talk about.
676,"I don't think I got much out of therapy, but I was probably holding back a lot also."
677,"tl;dr: Tried meds and therapy, but I'm ready to try again."
678,Does it really help to talk to a doctor or a therapist?
679,"I am not a psychiatrist, a psychologist, or a therapist, and I have no intention of charging you for a solution you could potentially stumble upon yourself, given enough time and effort."
680,"After speaking with various counselors and therapists, my condition only seemed to worsen."
681,"New meds, more therapy, move back home with parents because I can't be trusted to be alone."
682,I plan on telling her this fall in my therapist's office.
683,Hence why I'm getting it off in therapy.
684,"I've started the process of weaning myself off it and will probably look into cognitive behavioural therapy as an alternative to medication in general, but I understand coming off the drug can be rather difficult."
685,I've had bouts of therapy and medications throughout my teens and early 20's.
686,Right now I'm on lexapro and searching for a therapist.
687,Whether it's a therapist or your best friend.
688,I am going to get therapy in 6-7 months.
689,I dont really have the funds to pay for the therapy so i have to go trough the states hoops so i can get some assistance and it will take a while.
690,"So I went to my therapist today hoping to have him give me some insight and help me feel better(What an irrational thought, his job isn't to make me feel good)."
691,"I talked with my therapist about these things and he said I was normal, but its like, I don't think I am."
692,"Any good therapist will do, though."
693,"I made it to my first therapy session today, and the doctor said I should go on medication considering how long I've had panic disorder (almost 10 years now)."
694,"I have STD/LTD through work, and a supplemental policy I have on my own, but I don't know what, other than my therapists records and my past disabilities, that I would need."
695,"I have a therapist who is very very helpful and I have a great and understanding relationship with my family and friends about my situation, but there are still many times when I find myself feeling very alone and helpless."
696,My CBT therapist found out that I hadn't started taking my lexapro yet and told me to start immediately or he wouldn't be able to continue with the CBT.
697,"I'm 16, and my parents have gotten me 3 therapists."
698,"I saw a therapist for about a year, but I had to take a break for the holidays."
699,"I'll be back in therapy in a couple weeks, and I'm planning on trying yoga and meditation again."
700,I am 28 years old and I feel like I am surely but slowly starting to deal with my anxiety by having intense therapy.
701,My therapist says I'm not psychotic just super super anxious but I still worry.
702,"I have never seen a therapist and told very few people about this, but I feel like it is ruining my life and I'm scared."
703,"A few months ago, I started seeing a therapist again."
704,I'm crying while typing this) and the therapist was one of the worst experiences I've had in a long time very full on panic attack).
705,"The thing is a lot of those people, including her now-ex-SO, have told her she needs to see a therapist, and she's taken that to mean they don't actually want to help her."
706,I did some research and I found some trans-friendly therapists in the area (she is transgender).
707,Have you had experience with a regular therapist or psychiatrist?
708,I feel I need more help and was reffered to a therapist.
709,I even did therapy for 2 years (recently) and I'm right back in the same fucking boat.
710,TLDR: I've been through a lot of trauma I haven't dealt with even in 2 years of therapy and a shit ton of medication.
711,"I am seeing a therapist a couple times a month, and I am not taking meds (I don't want to be on them)."
712,"The therapy sort of helps, I am sort of okay at trying to talk myself out of it sometimes, and keeping busy helps too, but it's really not enough."
713,"I need to have something to look at, or else my therapist is gonna get mad at me again tomorrow."
714,I've been seeing a therapist for half a year and I do not take medication (I have lorazepam and beta-blockers but I never use them).
715,"I feel like I do so much to stave off my anxiety: I exercise religiously, I meditate every night, I've cut back my drinking, I see a therapist, I drink tea, I read, and try to set aside time during the school day to just relax."
716,I see my therapist this Friday and I'm probably going to tell one of my roommates what happened because I think it will make me feel safe knowing someone who lives with me knows I'm kinda going through something.
717,"i would recommend seeing someone though, just email a therapist online and go."
718,"I am not a 12 year old, I am a 30 year old who was just diagnosed with GAD and have been working through it with a variety of methods, therapy, medicine, breathing exercises and stuff like that."
719,"My therapist describes people as having ""scouts"" inside of a person."
720,"I know that the meds and the therapy have helped me in these weeks, and helped me realize that I have had this problem for a long time, but I just want to say ""fuck you anxiety, seriously, fuck you."
721,"Hello all,
So I've been seeing a therapist and counselor and taking meds and whatnot for a few years."
722,"I'm looking into starting therapy again, and called a local place (live in a small town near a slightly bigger small town so there aren't many local options)."
723,"They presented their therapists according to price, which was kind of odd, and they offered one for $20 an hour who they ""think would be a good fit"" for me, who is still a graduate student I assume pursuing her masters....I'm not sure."
724,I have been in therapy for depression for a while now.
725,"My therapist and i are coming around to discussing this, but in the meantime, can someone tell me why i feel this way?"
726,should i try cbt therapy or hypnotherapy?
727,"On top of that, I got a lecture from a dentist of all people this week about anti-anxiety medication and about how useless therapy is because, ""people can solve their own problems."""
728,"They've tried everything to help me, therapists, ADHD medication (even though I feel  I don't have it)."
729,"I also started seeing a psychologist at the beginning of the month to try some form of CBT/exposure therapy, but bringing out most of my fears/worries into the forefront of my mind has made my day-to-day stuff a bit harder to deal with."
730,"Now to the question, I've already been to therapy and it didn't really help that much because she had to leave after the first few months and the minuscule dosage of ativan barely helped."
731,Seek another therapist?
732,"Finally, after six months, my gyno, my therapist, and I all agreed I should try getting off of the birth control, and in the month that has followed, I can say that my anxiety has calmed down a lot, but I still have some really hard days, and I still have a lot of trouble relaxing."
733,I had a breakdown at work so I am in therapy along with on a medicine regime to try and control my OCD and anxiety.
734,"I accepted I was gay last year and this year I decided that I want to act on it and meet someone and I have been talking to a guy who is really nice and I really like him and he is also aware of anxiety problems and that I see a therapist and he is fine with it (in fact, he has problems with similar things)."
735,"I had a therapy session today where we dealt with my deeper, childhood abandonment issues."
736,It felt cathartic and I felt better afterwards and the therapist seemed to suggest it was a breakthrough.
737,And I don't regularly see a therapist.
738,I know that immersion therapy is a thing and I think that coffee could artificially induce anxiety without having to go out and interact with strangers.
739,"I went to a therapist that helped greatly, and I finished at the end of last spring."
740,A therapist?
741,I'm scheduling therapy soon because I'm sure it'll help.
742,I've been on and off meds and working through therapy.
743,Along with my cognitive therapist.
744,"So to recap I'm supposed to take these two medicines and I ""might feel better by Easter"" in the mean time I'm supposed to just stop thinking anytime I feel anxious and breathe, not take the klonopin I got from my school doctor that I took maybe three times a week tops, and then he might do therapy."
745,"(Aside from therapy, already planning to hit that up)"
746,"I go see my therapist, and he says that's a bad idea."
747,I am doing therapy with focus on mindfulness and CBT stuff.
748,For those of you that are seeing a therapist how did you find your therapist?
749,I've never talked to a therapist or mental health professional.
750,"I cant tell if we are just not compatible, or if I need to go to therapy to fix myself and stop picking fights."
751,I am willing to pay whatever it takes if it means therapy will fix our fights.
752,"---   
**tl;dr**: – I’m not sure if I need therapy for my anxiety or if my boyfriend’s past behaviour has scarred me so much that we should break up."
753,"I stopped going to therapy after some bad experiences with them, and I've spent the last 12 years with no help at all, and now I'm in a very bad state."
754,"One of the major hurdles convincing them to go that they are worried that if they seek therapy, the therapist might force them on medication."
755,"So yesterday was going to be the first time I'd seen her in a month, I've been having some anxiety since I quit smoking about leaving the house recently but I really wanted to talk out some situations with her, just normal therapy crap."
756,"My counsellor wants me to do some group based therapy, and I actually like that idea."
757,"Problem is that this group therapy happens bang in the middle of the week, lasts for 2 hours, and is quite some distance away."
758,"It clashes with work, and by the time I travel too therapy, attend, and get back, more than half the day would be over."
759,"When all is said and done, it looks like I most probably won't be attending this therapy, which frustrates me enormously."
760,I [25f] recently started therapy sessions (once a week) for my generalized anxiety and panic disorder.
761,"I've started to see a therapist recently and she's come to the conclusion that I most likely have GAD, and is going to refer me to a psychiatrist to possibly get me prescribed some medication while we start therapy."
762,"I'm not looking for suggestions of therapy or medication, though that has been a real consideration recently, because I know most of the medication has horrible side effects I'd like to stay away from."
763,"Hi all,

Tomorrow I'm going to a therapist for the first time."
764,In a few hours I will be attending my first group therapy.
765,I recently spoke to my therapist about this and asked for some help to deal with this and she suggested the possibility of medication to help me cope.
766,Should I try a different therapist?
767,"i've been coping well(ish) with my anxiety, i see a therapist and take medication but it just feels unbearable right now."
768,I'm in therapy and have been taking medication but it's not helping.
769,(My previous therapist said control is a big issue for me and I need to work on being comfortable with things being out off my control.
770,I am currently looking for a new therapist because I didn't feel like my previous therapist really clicked with me.)
771,I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist but I'm so sick of putting posion in my body on a daily basis.
772,I go to therapy but..ya..anyone have anything I can do to just calm down??
773,"I struggle pretty frequently with anxiety, and I'm in therapy for it."
774,I've set up an appointment with my therapist (which I can barely afford) for Tuesday but I can't see him until then.
775,"In various books I've read, they've talked about how with proper therapy over the years, your brain can start to actually reform some of the chemical pickups that are missing to balance everything out."
776,"After doing some reading, talking with my wife, my therapist, etc, I think I'm ready to taper off the meds."
777,I can go to therapy twice a week by public transportation.
778,"When I'm at home, I have no public transportation to go to therapy."
779,Tried doing a search a dozen different ways but the ADAA website can't find a *single* therapist in my city of 2 million people.
780,"Are there any other ways I can find a good, accredited therapist in my area?"
781,I recently have had more severe panic attacks so I’ve gone to both a therapist and a couple different psychiatrists.
782,"So I’m in therapy for about 3 weeks and now and I feel it’s helping, but there is still days where my panic is crippling."
783,But I have only got to three 45 minute therapy sessions (once a week) and even though I’m feeling better there is a creeping thought that my anxiety will come back and impede me.
784,"I don't know if I should see a primary care physician (which I don't currently have) to try and get medication, or start therapy with a psychologist or psychiatrist."
785,or do I speak to like a therapist and how do I find one?
786,"I have never been on any medication for anxiety

I've also been to a ""therapist"" type person who taught me some techniques on how to deal with the anxiety (E.g breathing and relaxation techniques) and they helped cure it for a short period of time but now they are only just about getting me by."
787,"I see a therapist, which helps, but I can't seem to get a handle on the anxiety."
788,I looked into it and CBT years ago because I had no money to afford therapy and I wanted to fix this problem without taking medication.
789,"I even had a therapist call me a ""robot."""
790,"I ideally should be seeing a psychiatrist instead of a GP, but I have the added stress of having to speak a foreign language in therapy is a huge deterrent for me."
791,I'm afraid that if I do end up with a prescription or therapy that I won't be able to pay for it.
792,"My therapist says I'm progressing in some ways, but I feel like I'm still stuck in the darkness I've been dealing with for months now."
793,"The doctor at A&amp;E said CBT therapy will help, and I am booked in for 3 weeks from now.."
794,Exposure therapy?
795,"I've tried therapy to but I can only get 6 week sessions for free, and I accomplished nothing throughout it over than short term relief of having someone to rant to, but I don't feel like this was the therapists fault."
796,I know I need to seek therapy for this but currently the financial costs are prohibitive and will be for the foreseeable future.
797,"I was wondering if anyone else suffers from something similar, and if anyone has any self-help tips or recommendations, until a few years' time when I can hopefully afford therapy?"
798,"I was prescribed some SSRI's, which I didn't take because I'd rather try some therapy first, before moving right on to drugs and also because of some horror stories associated with those drugs."
799,"I've already set an appointment tomorrow for a therapist, but are there any other things other than what I described I should be doing."
800,"Hi all 

i've posted to this thread a few times before in the past ( using throw away accounts )

i remember back then i was asking such questions as ""should i seek therapy""  or ""whats counseling like ? """
801,"well the thing is that i posted those questions a little over 7 months ago, since then i did go to therapy and i got to admit it was one of the hardest things i ever had to do, i lost count how many times i burst into a flood of tears while walking home after a session."
802,It's an issue I've dealt with my entire life (and I'm currently seeking therapy for).
803,"Recently I've started testosterone therapy as well, I've noticed that it did help immensely for several months, now it feels as if I'm slipping back into my depression and anxiety."
804,I'm afraid of getting judged by the therapist.
805,I'm also afraid that the therapist would try to push their own live values onto me.
806,"but truthfully, even if you don't live in Asia, I'd want to know if you've had doubt over therapy or whether anyone has had any bad experiences and how you dealt with it."
807,"The intake woman told me, again, that I had panic disorder and that they would call me in a few days and match me with a therapist."
808,So my therapist suggested I go to the library so I'm not stuck in my house all day.
809,About 2 weeks ago was the first time I told anyone that I want to start seeing a therapist.
810,"When I type in the names of the other 2, just a bunch of message boards (but not as cohesive or legit as Reddit) come up like ""rate your therapist"" or things like that."
811,"In short what I'm asking is, does anyone have advice picking a therapist?"
812,we're poor and don't have the money for a therapist or psychiatrist.
813,"I've been seeing a therapist about Social Anxiety for about two years now, and recently for the first time the issue of my love life has come up."
814,Talking about these things has made me feel a lot more anxious during therapy than I have felt for a while.
815,I've been thinking about it/ talking about it lately with my therapist and she has told me all of the signs of early set schizophrenia but I'm still scared.. still afraid of having it on my medical record.
816,"I've been to four regular doctors, two behavioral health doctors and a therapist and all of them said the same thing: ""You didn't fry your brain with your first smoke."""
817,"I had my first CBT session this morning, and we didn't even get into any real practices because my therapist had such a good discussion with me about how what I was feeling was, in fact, all anxiety related."
818,"I went to therapy some time ago and it helped me a lot, but it did not clear everything, so do you guys have some tips I can use?"
819,I believe that the perfectionism needs to stop and that I can find a way to hopefully through therapy or something find a way to feel less insecure and crave less recognition and attention.
820,I'm seeing a therapist but I don't see them enough and every time an episode like this happens my next appointment is a good 2 weeks away.
821,"My therapy appointment is today, and I am absolutely sure my therapist will say I can have one, but the problem is my dad."
822,The way to increase the chances of getting one is if my therapist says I need one.
823,"The problem that I am going to face is telling my dad my therapist says we need a dog, I am to afraid."
824,I've been seeing a therapist for a few weeks and thats helping me the most.
825,I've recently started therapy.
826,I've done therapy before and one session just made me feel worse.
827,"All my life i have had anxiety problems, but i have become rather skilled at using my mental tools acquired through years of therapy to thwart the onslaught of anxiety that i usually face."
828,I was in therapy for about 2 years which helped me but my anxiety started to come back when I stopped going.
829,"I started medication 3 weeks ago and I'm working on it slowly with my therapist, but money's getting tight."
830,"only recently have i realized this isnt healthy, ive started to bring my mom into the mix to see if she can get me a therapist or something."
831,"I've always struggled with anxiety, but usually therapy or relaxing exercises keep it under control."
832,"I have a few days until my appointment with a therapist, where I will hopefully get my own prescription for something to help take the edge off until I can see the psychiatrist."
833,I can't afford therapy.
834,"I want to start getting help for this but I don't know if I should jump straight into counselling/therapy, or if I should talk to my doctor about it first and get a formal diagnosis (or not, if they don't find my symptoms to be those of anxiety issues) before going on to therapy."
835,"I am trying to find a therapist but in the meantime, I was wondering if anyone had any ideas."
836,I don't want psychotherapy or meds.
837,My therapist says that part of my recovery is to not go to the doctor multiple times for things that the doctors say aren't serious.
838,Have any of you been through therapy for health anxiety before?
839,I am on zoloft and xanax and see a therapist.
840,"Anyway, one therapist would tell my regular doctor to prescribe an SSRI (she said probably Celexa or Zoloft), I guess, and that presumably doesn't take all that long."
841,Should I go with the therapist + regular doctor or the psychiatrist?
842,"Not sure if that was clear enough, but whenever I visit psychotherapists, or talk with my family members about my anxiety, I tend to ramble and jump around because I feel like there's so many things to my anxiety, as to how it came about, what triggers me and why, what I experience.."
843,"GAD with depression, seeing a therapist."
844,"I've been trying to work with my therapist, but I seem to have a terrible time breaking out of my old habits."
845,"So I talked to my doctor and got back on Fluoxetine which was the first SSRI I got back in 2007, along with sessions of coginitive behavioral therapy."
846,I saw a therapist yesterday and decided to see her again next week.
847,"I'm really fucking pissed that I have to be on zoloft, and seeing a therapist to begin with."
848,"I should be talking to my therapist about this, which I am going to soon hopefully, but honestly I just wanted to type all this out."
849,I've been in therapy for anxiety for over a year now.
850,"Some info, we're both in our early 20's, she's in therapy but not on medication."
851,I just started seeing a therapist who recommended it.
852,"The problem is, that, due to my insurance, to see a therapist I would have to withdraw from my current school and return home."
853,"I started seeing a new therapist again a couple months ago, which was going well, but I can't ever get a session scheduled with her anymore."
854,Around that time my therapist left even though I was telling her as much information as I am in this post about being agoraphobic.
855,I stopped going out of the house and everything fed into my agoraphobiaAround this time was when my therapist quit.
856,"Anyway, to cut a long story short, I suppose my question is: how 'normal' is it to cry when you're at the therapist's?"
857,"The rational part of me says that as you're talking about your problems and anxieties, of course you're going to cry and they must see it every day in their job, but then the part of me that won't let me cry in front of others (apart from a select few close relatives) is stopping me from going to a therapist in the first place, just in case I cry."
858,So have you cried in therapy?
859,I'm on a waiting list for therapy and I was debating if it's something I should mention to the therapist.
860,I called a therapist once and the phone kept breaking up and they couldn't understand my name and the phone cut off...and I never called them back.
861,I told her how I have been on Klonopin for almost 4 years now and I still get attacks despite me going to a therapist and trying to overcome my issues.
862,I've been in therapy since February for work stress and other issues.
863,"I don't want to mention it to my psych or therapist because they'll tell me I need to chill the eff out, but I'm afraid that will make my grades lower."
864,"My family, friends, and therapist have all encouraged me, observed and reminded me how much better I've been getting, and have reminded me to be patient and see it through."
865,The therapist finally called yesterday and booked me an appointment for Tuesday morning.
866,I was diagnosed quite recently (though I've probably had the disorders for most of my life) and I've never been to therapy before.
867,I'm for example worried that the therapist won't understand me or that my personality will change when my anxiety disorders and depression are treated etc.
868,"What should I expect from my first session, the therapist and CBT in general?"
869,"Also, has therapy helped you?"
870,"Thanks,

rebbieh

EDIT: For how long are you usually in therapy?"
871,"After talking to a therapist, I pinpointed one of the sources to be my father, because he has had bipolar disorder my whole life and certain events/triggers have therefore caused my anxiety."
872,"Don't get me wrong, I love therapy, but I feel like I get really anxious right before I go and suddenly ""forget"" what I wanted to talk about...

And, sometimes, I feel worse after e-mailing or talking to my therapist?"
873,"Of course one should consult a doctor, consider medication, therapy, etc etc."
874,"His mother yells and screams at the other kids, treats me as her own personal therapist, makes some racist comments about my co-worker, and tries to get me to do things I'm not supposed to do."
875,"she told me that she has anxiety and goes to group therapy / psych, and this is fine with me."
876,I have been suffering panic attacks since June and have tried both cognitive behavioral therapy and use xanax when needed (usually between .25mg and 1.5mg a day).
877,"Also, I haven't been to therapy in about a month because the person I went to was 45 mins away and all she tried with me was hypnotherapy which I felt helped calm me down, but it obviously didn't work completely."
878,"According to my therapist, a lot of my anxiety may be stemming from my childhood due to the fact that I was frequently sexually abused, neglected, witness to domestic violence, moved a lot, etc."
879,"I am supposed to start bio-feedback therapy soon, and am SO hopeful that it can help."
880,"I don't see my therapist again until next Tuesday, so I'm just hoping for a little help to get me through until then."
881,"I've been seeing a therapist for the past few months, but it's so hard for me to talk about this stuff as I'm scared of coming across weird."
882,I'm not on any medication for it and I'm not exactly sure what type it is because I just started therapy.
883,I´m having therapy for over 2 years now and I´ve been dealing with panic e intense anxiety.
884,"I'm thinking a therapist would help, but then I also think that just taking a few days easy and hanging out with her when I'm back to 100%."
885,"Her previous therapist changed his insurance policy, and now she's seeing no one."
886,That being said they DO have their use and doesn't necessarily mean you should freak out if your doctor or therapist recommends it.
887,My therapist has been recommending them but I have had a bad experience with them before.
888,"I had my first therapy session at my college today (was seeing a therapist before I got here and had been putting off making an appointment here for literally all quarter), and I just needed to talk about how great it was to people who will actually get it."
889,"I've seen two other therapists in my life and both of them kind of let me direct the conversation, which is bad for me because I get nervous and ramble about things that don't actually matter."
890,"My therapist suggested to go on antidepressants a few days ago.. but since i barely see any positive storys about meds, i'm kind of worried."
891,"During these 3 months I have been in intensive outpatient therapy, hospitalized, and finally put on medication."
892,"I've been living with the fear for the last 1.5 years now that the drugs have caused my Anxiety, Paranoia and Panic Attacks but my therapists think other wise..."
893,"I got the dog about a month ago because I thought it would help ease my anxiety, and also my therapist recommended me to get one."
894,"Hey guys, so my therapist wants me to take a 500 question test to help him understand me and I'm wondering if anyone has done anything similar?"
895,I'm not really interested in therapy or medication at this point.
896,"I've been in therapy on and off since I was seven and have tried several medications, all of which have either had no effect or have made me worse."
897,None of my recent therapists have been very worried about this but t scares the hell out of me.
898,The last one I was on caused such severe side effects that I developed a fear of pretty much all medicine and my last therapist agreed that the anxiety the act of taking medicine caused wasn't worth the possible benefits at that given time.
899,I've also bounced around to a lot of therapists but none of them have ever done anything to help me.
900,I was previously diagnosed with adhd and bipolar 2 but both of these diagnoses were later declared to be wrong by other therapists.
901,"I have been to five different therapists, and I have been on medication."
902,Since I'm going to intake on Monday would there be any source of documents the therapist can provide to help me get out cashiering?
903,I've even tried rTMS treatment with cognitive therapy but no help.
904,"I am currently on medication and seeing a therapist, but what comes next has been my way of coping since my disorders first took over my life."
905,I've suffered with mental health issues for a long time but had been getting on quite well with therapy before I realised I needed a little help with the anxiety and attacks.
906,I have been seeing a therapist but afraid to tell the whole truth.
907,I never thought about seeing a therapist when I was a teenager.
908,I've definitely improved myself through therapy and medication but there's a long road ahead.
909,"Hello,

I've never spoken about this with anyone outside my family and doctors/therapists."
910,My therapist speculates that when my step father got angry with me and yelled at me that it felt like abuse to me cause of the abuse i endured in the past from the men in my life.
911,anything can help.. as even my therapist is at a loss.
912,"On a side note, considering that two seperate GP's in the past incorrectly diagnosed a knee problem I had and led to the arches in my feet collapsing and having to pay for my own physiotherapy for over a year makes me feel less than confident in their services."
913,"I have never been properly diagnosed with anything and have tried medical and psychological therapies with varying degrees of success, but ultimately not getting very far."
914,"My therapist has classified this as anxiety, so I think this is the appropriate place to ask about it."
915,So has anybody ever had a similar experience with therapy?
916,"A mood stabilizers and something for anxiety,
She also wishes me to go and see a therapist and a psychologist."
917,Has anyone here tried TMS therapy for anxiety/depression?
918,My therapist says to at least friend request him on facebook.
919,"The mirtazipine has made me gain soooo much weight, so after some good therapy break throughs and discussion with my doctor, we decided I could come straight off of it, because it was such a low dose to begin with."
920,I'm still going to go to therapy and find out why I'm crazy in relationships.
921,I want to try therapy.
922,"If I seek a therapist, what do I look for?"
923,"Kirk called me into his office and talked to me for a few hours, asked me if I wanted to see a therapist, explained how common it was, and even offered to pay for it."
924,I learned this from seeing a therapist.
925,I actually love talking to a therapist when I can.
926,"I saw a therapist, but we mainly talked about things unrelated to me emotion."
927,I'm seeing a new therapist who does more stuff for me.
928,"Hi all, let's share some of the stuff we do in our therapy sessions/the schedule of a typical session."
929,Maybe others can try a few of the activities/homework tasks by themselves if going to a therapist seems too much.
930,"I've been on medication for as long as I can remember, and am currently on a waiting list to see a psychologist (I'm already seeing a psychiatrist) after my former therapist of a year saw that I wasn't improving and suggested I see someone higher up."
931,The last therapist I called had a three month waiting list.
932,I've been forced to a therapist when I was young because when my parents got divorced that means I need therapy for some reason?
933,Note: I am beginning to see a therapist.
934,"Now, I'm not trying to be a jerk boyfriend, and I'm the furthest thing from a doctor, but my mother, who has been going to therapy and is exactly like my girlfriend, can see the signs too."
935,"She has gone to therapy for a few sessions, but stopped going because she did not like her therapist(not exactly sure if she was a psychiatrist or psychologist)."
936,A therapist mentioned to her that there are short term intensive anxiety programs.
937,"after i was diagnosed, they stopped sending me to the therapist and hoped that pretending it didn't exist would make it go away."
938,"I'm 28 now, and haven't been to a therapist since I was 18."
939,I think it might be time to see a therapist and maybe get on some meds or something.
940,"I know exposure therapy is used for phobias, does it work for other sources of anxiety?"
941,"-Got into therapy 
-Beat depression
-Got ahold of my anxiety
-Controlling my OCD (clinical, not just using that term)
-Beat my amphetamine addiction
-Stopped using alcohol to deal with stress
-Met new friends
-Re-made old friends
-Stopped my porn addiction (I still watch it but it doesn't rule me anymore)
-I eat great now
-I take vitamins
-Beat my caffeine addiction (1,500mg per day before at points)
-Learned to live on my own
-Learned to meditate and be mindful
-Learned to live with idiots (my house mates are not... ""ideal"" people)
-Learned how to be in a relationship and still be independent 
-Now work out six days a week with nothing but good food and a little creatine to bulk me up a bit

Age 22

So there's my report card for this semester."
942,"I know it's a chance to chill out, start therapy, do yoga, read, paint, etc., but my birthday is in August."
943,"I'm seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist who told me yesterday that I have GAD, OCD, panic disorder, and chronic motor tic disorder."
944,"Thanks - I start therapy next week, wish me luck!"
945,"My psychiatrist brought it up my last visit a few weeks ago, and my therapist has asked me multiple times if I think I have it."
946,"I experience anxiety, and see a therapist for it, although my records don't specify an actual diagnosis, such as GAD or anything."
947,"I have been in therapy since 2009, and with my current therapist since 2011."
948,"I can't believe, while always ignoring my doctor and my therapist about my problems, that I simultaneously was freaking out over websites (that don't look credible) that were telling me I've had a host of problems."
949,"Anyhow, the good thing is that it kind of jolted me into finally calling a therapist."
950,Is this alone something you find a new therapist over?
951,"I've been through therapy and tried a few different drug combinations (Xanax only as needed has proven to be the most useful/least impairing), but I tend to prefer using breathing techniques and relaxation exercises to work through my panic symptoms."
952,The person who sent me to the group home also was the one to have home care workers in charge so when I had a post traumatic-y meltdown thing and yelled to my therapists at the top of my lungs on the phone for putting me ina  situation where I could have been killed by crazy people (the assault did actually happen) she forced the workeres to live with me.
953,n another reply I remembered that the atuistic guy was actually in elctroshock therapy and shit too and a worker told me that he wanted to cut my penis off with a knife and he shit his pants and pissed his pants it wasf ucking fucking screaming at me literally eveyrday telling meto fuck off in ahighpitched voice and then to ilve next to ag goddamn titless bitch that used her death to fucking fucking be that much of a rude asshole.
954,Oh yeah and the best part is that my therapist left me because goign into shock from seeing an animal carcus that I saw while I wasin the hospital means I was not trauamtized enough to get help.
955,"The meds I've tried haven't helped much, and I've been rather resistant to therapy."
956,Ive had social anxiety for a few years and I am currently in therapy getting treatment.
957,"On top of that, I had group therapy today, very anxiety inducing for me lately."
958,I find it hard to find somewhere to go and I don't really know what I can be doing beyond therapy and medication.
959,No therapy now.
960,"I've been going to therapy/CBT for about two months now, and it's was helping me quite a bit."
961,"I'll try my best to employ techniques that I've been taught in therapy, but it seems like my ""default"" emotion is ""set"" at cynicism/pessimism To illustrate, trying to reach a decent level of optimism lately has been like trying to get an old car to start."
962,"(Short of go see a therapist!).

))"
963,That's when I started to see a therapist and a psychiatrist.
964,"note: I do attend therapy, but it seems like this is something that happens no matter how much I try to work through it."
965,"So continuing on with the anxiety bit, my doctor told me that I have anxiety (without even assessing me or ANYTHING) and she'll have me see a psychiatrist and if it goes on for a longer time I'll be attending therapy and receiving medicine."
966,I had two appointments after that (I had two more this month but I didn't go to any) in which she just tried to persuade me to give group therapy another try (which I shall explain later) and she tried to get me to join sports and teams of sorts.
967,I don't really know if a therapist is the answer and I don't particularly have the money to see one anyway.
968,He doesn't currently see a therapist but is working on getting one.
969,"I started going to therapy which helped a little, but not much."
970,"Please, I don't want therapy or medication."
971,"I have tried calling every therapist within a 5 mile radius of me using the search function in the sidebar, but either a) they don't call back b) they call back a few days later, but I am not in their network or they do not take insurance or c) they dont specialize in anxiety/depression for adults."
972,I dont know where else to find a therapist.
973,"Even calling and asking for help over the phone to the therapists I did talk to was very awkward (and I talk to people all day on the phones for work, many cold calls that aren't this awkward)."
974,How did you guys find your therapist?
975,He's seeing a therapist weekly.
976,"His therapist says he supposed to meditate, but he doesn't, and I feel like he's not trying hard enough to get better."
977,So school has started again and with the help of some therapy and personal growth ive become more confident and no longer get anxious or have panic attacks.
978,"As a guy, I can't talk to anyone about this and when I mention this elsewhere they say I should seek therapy and medication."
979,"Yet, I work two jobs, live paycheck to paycheck paying for grad school and don't even have a lunch break most days, how the hell can I have time to see or afford a therapist?"
980,"She has some therapy sessions coming up, but may be a few more weeks."
981,"As I got older in middle school, my mother took me to a therapist who taught me relaxation techniques."
982,The therapist gave me freaking relaxation tapes to listen to at night.
983,"And finally yet again, parents take me to the therapist."
984,"Wall of text summary: traumatic experiences in childhood, shamed by mother &amp; father regarding anxiety,  panic attacks and IBS flares as a kid, little relief from therapy and drugs, raped as teen, avoids social situations."
985,"I know I need therapy, but I can't afford it."
986,I read about it on my therapist's bio and she was very specific in asking about my body sensations when in a panic attack or feeling anxious.
987,Just wondering if anyone has had this kind of therapy and how it has worked for them.
988,"I don't want to have this be my life, the depression or the massage therapy career."
989,"Today I had my first appointment with a new therapist, my first appointment for two months."
990,I have an appointment with a psychiatrist BEFORE my next appointment with this new therapist and she absolutely thinks I should take meds without knowing ANYTHING about me.
991,"That becomes a problem however because my fiance and I have come on hard financial times, due to ineptitude by my doctor's office, CIGNA health care (my disability provider) and my therapist's office."
992,"So it's been about a year since I've had any form of therapy for my anxiety/depression this Friday I'm going back, and quite frankly this terrifies me."
993,I've been to a couple therapists.
994,"I feel like the only person I can talk to is my therapist, because I'm actually paying her to listen to me."
995,"I find it really hard to talk to my therapist, because sometimes I just don't feel anxious or depressed on the days of my appointments."
996,"After a while on meds and doing therapy I thought I was ok with my anxiety problems, but I'm not."
997,I tried going to a therapist but I feel too nervous there and I get the same problems as in school.
998,Should I see a therapist?
999,"i told the girl i liked who i had been good friends for for years about my issues, following the guidance of my therapist, and just wanting to open up and have someone to talk to (besides my family, who I feel like I am becoming a burden on)... she has distanced herself from me and not even checked in with me, after we used to be really good friends and she first gave me a response that seemed really supportive."
1000,How do I find a therapist that will take my health insurance?
1001,"I'm on my parent's still and out of state, what if I can't find a therapist in my area that will take my insurance?"
1002,"My therapist encouraged me to get a hobby that encouraged [""flow""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29)."
1003,I have done therapy and I was on lexapro over about 2 years ago but tapered off with  dr. Help.
1004,I began by going to a therapist to talk about the issues I was having for about a 6 month period.
1005,"Edit: I'd like to clarify that it is not possible for me to see a therapist right now, as I have no source of income, and my parents do not have the means to pay for me."
1006,The anxiety caused irrational fears of things that a therapist/counselor helped me to identify and work through.
1007,I called a therapist today and scheduled an appointment.
1008,I've been seeing a therapist that has been trying to help.
1009,"I'm seeing a therapist here and I'm hoping to get control of this, but all the research I do only makes it worse."
1010,I have seen therapists and I have a therapist that I see occasionally now.
1011,But therapy seems like an expensive and time-consuming process.
1012,Or head straight for a psychologist/therapist type?
1013,"this is me in case your wondering:
http://imgur.com/a/of3gl#PyRG02z

I'm getting therapy soon, but please help me understand, if you've ever felt this way?"
1014,"Hey everyone,
Just thought I'd come onto this subreddit to offer my time and experiences with taking Lexapro to those of you who might be contemplating going the medication route or therapy route or whatever might be bothering you."
1015,"I’ve never seen a doctor, therapist, or counselor before."
1016,I check out therapists that take my insurance and think about seeking counselling.
1017,"I started Zoloft a week ago, and for some miscommunication reason between my  therapist and psychiatrist, I was not supposed to be on Zoloft."
1018,I'm not good at telling people when I need help but I am afraid of going through another medicine change... My therapist says I would do better on Abilify but I've heard bad things about it... Should I expect the issues to go away?
1019,I asked my therapist for a way to alleviate anxiety right before bed.
1020,"I've been seeing a therapist, I hope I can get better."
1021,"In the past month, leaving him combined with being back in a very stressful home has caused me to become very depressed and anxious, and even though I'm seeing a therapist, I'm still having issues with it."
1022,"I'll be going to my family doctor to discuss my problem and hopefully get a referral to a psychiatrist in order to begin some form of therapy, perhaps medication (though, preferably not, but I guess we'll see), and whatever else."
1023,I saw therapists.
1024,Do i need a referral to see a therapist or can i just make an appointment?
1025,I would intend on registering her as a therapy pet when she is old enough too.
1026,"Weekly therapy used to help, but I'm at the point where I need to do something more drastic."
1027,"I've strongly been against taking meds for my anixety, in part because therapy always helped."
1028,"There really isn't anyone that can understand in my own social circle and unfortunately, I don't see a therapist that often due to cost."
1029,I stopped going to the therapist after the first day because my car was dead the day of my second appointment and I was too embarrassed to call and reschedule.
1030,And therapy just makes me jittery and uncomfortable.
1031,"As a side note, I'm in therapy and working on this by exposing myself to the fear by not writing things down (with few exceptions)."
1032,"She is seeing a therapist, but they haven't really covered this yet, and her therapist is on a break  right now, so it'll be awhile before anything can be done...sorry for the long post, I just want to help her stop!"
1033,Hi all... this might be super obvious to all of you but the psychiatrist and therapist have made me understand some basic things about panic attacks in the last few weeks which made me realise I've been managing it wrong this whole time.
1034,"Anyway I know all of that often seems undoable at the time, but I was made to do it in therapy today and my god did it help."
1035,"She has some therapy sessions coming up, but may be a few more weeks."
1036,I talked to my mother about it and she just told me to make an appointment with my therapist.
1037,"I was prescribed anxiety/depression medicine and it didn't help, got tested for gluten intolerance and allergies and that didn't help, went to a therapist and that didn't help."
1038,I don't think he'd go to the doctor's or talk to a therapist.
1039,"I'm not sure if I should get back to a therapist, but I've been feeling the need to talk about something lately, so I'm throwing it all down here."
1040,"I talked through a lot of this with my therapist where I used to live, and we worked through it all to determine that a lot of this comes from general anxiety I feel."
1041,"It's been about 1.25 years since I worked through anything with a therapist, as I moved to a new city and now work 80 hours/week."
1042,"(i hope this is a good place to post this)

Hi folks,

I posted about this in my AMA a few days ago, but wanted to let you know I've started a simple campaign to encourage people to talk about therapy."
1043,"So I'm asking everyone I know to send one tweet and/or fb post on May 1 (first day of Mental Health Awareness Month) at 9am:

“There's nothing wrong w/ talking about therapy."
1044,"http://thndr.it/PcJefI”

If you would be willing to do this, please make your way to https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/10289-therapyhelped and click on the Support With Twitter / Support With Facebook button, and Thunderclap will take care of the rest, auto-posting on your behalf on May 1."
1045,"I can't take this anymore, I get myself in therapy and make myself feel capable, like I can do it this time, but then it all comes back."
1046,"My therapist keeps telling me ""this is just a blip."""
1047,I am hoping a) I can find a new place soon b) my therapy will work.
1048,"My therapist just re-diagnosed me with General Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia and Depression."
1049,"Tomorrow I’m seeing the doctors to rule out any physical reasons (lack of vitamins etc), and a therapist to try and clear things out."
1050,"(Y/N)    
- Are you in therapy?"
1051,I don't see my school therapist until tuesday.
1052,"**For those of you that are foregoing medication...**

C. What method(s) are you utilizing (various forms of talk therapy, meditation, etc."
1053,i'm going to the therapist on friday
1054,"I don't think my bboyfriend will understand, he will think I'm exaggerating the problems, that I'm just being weak or whiny


He tells me to get into therapy but I can't afford therapy."
1055,"I have insurance but with a $900 deductible, and even when I hit that I'd have to pay 20% and I don't make enough to be dropping $1000+ on therapy


I can't talk to my parents because they're even worse off than I am and I can't bear to add my own depression and anxiety onto theirs


And friends?"
1056,"I dont feel like I can talk to anyone about it, and I am unsure of whether I need to talk to a therapist, although I really don't want to have to."
1057,Do I need a therapist?
1058,"The only ""stranger"" i've sat down with and had a ""conversation"" with recently was a therapist and that's when she said I had social anxiety."
1059,I feel as though I have lots of deep issues with myself that need fixing/therapy beyond taking medications.
1060,"In school, I solved it by seeing therapists/utilizing a support group."
1061,"She responded well to chemotherapy, so I was grateful and took it for granted that she'll be fine."
1062,I'm getting help from a psychotherapist but what if my anxiety never goes away?
1063,"Been to countless specialists, therapists, etc etc."
1064,"My mother has taken me to a therapist in the past, though because she had convinced the doctor that I had aspergers before I had met this person (which then formed the framework of our meeting), I was  literally too frustrated and flustered to say anything."
1065,There years later after medication and therapy I tried to go back and finish only to have a miscarriage in the bathrooms there and start the attacks all over again.
1066,I've been to every therapist who accepted my insurance or who I could temporarily afford to pay out of pocket.
1067,"Like I said, I finished therapy today after an entire school year of working on my anxiety."
1068,I'll still be taking Prozac and will probably either do group therapy next school year or go back to individual therapy.
1069,"In addition, my therapist is leaving next year (she was a one year intern), so if I decide I need individual therapy, I'll have to start with a completely new person."
1070,I was also a complete dork and started crying at the end of our session today because I was going to miss having her as my therapist.
1071,"There's a reason my therapist calls the holidays ""The institutionalized mass denial of seasonal depression due to the winter solstice."""
1072,"When talking to a therapist I act very differently than outside (well, unless I have to talk to someone I don't know)."
1073,"My life is currently on a good track and I've been un-medicated for a few years, but I always try to stay on top of types of therapies for anxiety sufferers, and try to study/practice them in my day-to-day life."
1074,"The next day I told my therapist, and that helped a little."
1075,"So, after about 10 sessions, my therapist made me realize that a big part of my anxiety was due to the fact that I constantly need others for some kind of ""approval""."
1076,"And then, my therapist said the most helpful thing in the world."
1077,"The counsellor gave me a worksheet for my anxiety, for CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy."
1078,"Through some alternative therapy, I feel like I'm really close to getting off my medication finally, but now I have another problem ... my job."
1079,"I've had anxiety problems for as long as I can remember, but they have in general, been improving with therapy."
1080,"If anyone has any advice for how to deal with it, or even just how to bring it up with my therapist it would greatly appreciated."
1081,The past 4 months I have been in therapy which will only help me for 2 days or so after my appointment.
1082,"I do CBT exercises, take medication, and have been through extensive therapy so that I may live a very quiet, shut-in life while being financially dependent on my partner, as I am not emotionally fit to work."
1083,"Multiple therapists, and multiple stays in psych wards have done nothing but make me paranoid about going back."
1084,"My insurance only covers preventative care until I hit my $3,000 deductible, and I only made $14,000 last year, so therapy is pretty much out of the question."
1085,"I have PTSD, Depression, and General Anxiety and have been through major therapy to deal with those issues."
1086,"I learned through my therapy, that developing positive thought patterns is a major thing you must do to fight the toxic thoughts."
1087,These severe episodes are scattered and inconsistent so I don't know if I should see a therapist.
1088,"Maybe it's weird, but - I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for several years now, and I've gotten better at handling them, without meds or therapy, just me and time."
1089,I've had anxiety/depression my whole life and for the first time I am seeing a therapist next week.
1090,Should I tell the therapist everything?
1091,"Part of my year-long psychotherapy (which I loved, but guy dismissed me because he couldn't justify continuing to my insurance) included all these little ""helps"", and one I still use (and assumed most people did, as well) is the portable ""emergency panic bag""; what he called a ""ready bag""."
1092,All my fears were confirmed during my first year when my anxiety became so pronounced that I started going to therapy and was diagnosed with GAD.
1093,I went to a therapist the other day and he told me that I'm the type of person who needs to avoid stressful situations and that I need to do things that really interest and excite me.
1094,I told my mom what the therapist said and she said he was a quack.
1095,My mom is the one who made me go to this therapist in the first place!
1096,I am due to see a psychiatrist for medication in a few days after talking about it (medication) with my therapist.
1097,"My mom, even though she confessed to having the same problems, tells me I can't get treatment (not even therapy), for it because it's something every teenager goes through."
1098,She pulled me out of therapy five years ago as soon as the therapist was telling me things she didn't agree with...
1099,My therapist recommended it.
1100,"So now I have some more stability in my life, I at least know SOME things about myself and what I want from my life, I've accomplished a few things and I'm seeing a very good therapist."
1101,"I think I can talk to my mom and get her on board to do something but counseling is probably not a great option because while she does speak English enough to get along (and her writing and reading is actually quite good) it's not going to be good enough for her to have any kind of therapy, and the language she does speak is not common enough to easily find a therapist."
1102,"My life is not without its ups and downs, I have an anxious disposition and experience bouts of depression, have been in therapy a few times during tough life experiences, but overall I've managed to get through life smoothly and without medication or serious issues."
1103,I ended up in therapy during the first year but eventually my therapist moved and I never ended up finding a replacement.
1104,My therapist told me it was a good idea to try the Xanax now so I could get some rest and also maybe get used to the idea of medicine.
1105,"For various reason, I postponed going to a Dr/physiotherapist and instead chose to spend my time worrying about it (yay!)."
1106,"Anyway, I went to a physiotherapist a while ago but I felt she was very dismissive of my concerns so I cut off contact with her."
1107,I have a time booked with another physitherapist soon but I don't know what to do.
1108,"Basically, I want a physiotherapist who understands anxiety disorders and how they can affect the body, but I also want an honest evaluation of my concerns."
1109,"I see a therapist and take some SSRIs, but I spent my last therapy session crying my eyes out because i was so scared, and the medication doesn't really help when I'm this on edge."
1110,"I also think about how much I will miss my therapist, as it is again a place I feel safe and secure."
1111,"I see a therapist, but it's not really helping me actually get over these problems."
1112,I put her in therapy and it comes to light that her father's actions cause a lot of her anxiety.
1113,He refuses to admit she is anxious and openly criticizes the therapist.
1114,"At her last therapy session(she goes weekly) the therapist asked if her dad if she ,the therapist could speak with him."
1115,When I spoke with the therapist she said her father is a narcissist.
1116,He refuses to listen to me or the therapist.
1117,"In college I went to a CBT therapist and it sort of worked, but my underlying thoughts have either returned or they never left."
1118,I don't have health insurance [I'm a college graduate applying for my Masters] and therapy is very expensive.
1119,"I've had manageable anxiety most of my life, have seen a few therapists, but since my mother passed away in January I have been having near-constant anxiety and more frequent panic attacks."
1120,I started seeing a new therapist a few weeks ago and she said we can try medication if I want but that she would like to give me tools to try to conquer panic on my own without medication.
1121,I have organised to speak to a clinical therapist over skype in 2 days (a family friend) but I need something to keep the anxiety at bay in the meantime while I try to get my college work done.
1122,I already have seen a therapist.
1123,I'm trying to start therapy.
1124,"The Psychology Today website has a database of therapists, but some are labeled ""psychologists,"" some ""therapists"" some ""clinical social workers"" some ""counselors,"" and I don't know the difference between them in practice."
1125,"I told my therapist and he said ""Don't worry, no one will notice anyway""."
1126,"Like I said above, once my body became accustomed to a partner, I'd be able to perform dependably, rain or shine

3)  Yes, I'll probably see a therapist about it one day, but I'm wondering if anyone here has been in my position before and has solved this problem by themselves."
1127,"But **I'm having a hard time not viewing it as a step back, especially now that I'm also going back to therapy."
1128,"For people who had to give up ""fun money"" to do therapy, how did you deal with that stress?"
1129,"I'm pretty much giving up restaurants, new clothes, tattoos, art supplies, a new phone, cosplay, and any other ""fun"" things that require money so I can go to therapy."
1130,"I've been planning to add to my steampunk costume since last summer and I've been planning new tattoos since last summer and I was supposed to get them right around now, but I just started therapy and now I have to give those up until... indefinitely."
1131,My therapist appointment on Saturday can't come soon enough.
1132,I might start getting counselling or a therapist in college to help me out.
1133,"well from my conclusion and my therapists conclusion, instead of accepting the stress and anxiety and not realizing what kind of physical symptoms goes along with both, i blamed it on the chemicals and thought for sure they were causing the problems."
1134,I have been seeing a therapist and was put on Remeron(7.5mg-&gt;and now taking 60mg) without any side effects.
1135,My first therapy appointment is in 3 weeks.
1136,"I talked to the therapist who headed the program and he seemed very sure of himself and despite my hesitance of spending over $200 for the next 8 weeks on a support group to learn CBT (as well as highly recommending individual therapist sessions), he was pressuring me into asking my parents for the money."
1137,"I've been seeing a therapist through my university, but its only for short term treatment."
1138,"I'd like to find a therapist off campus, since my sessions on campus ran out, but I am covered under my parent's insurance, and don't want them to find out I'm seeing doctors for anxiety (my father is part of the cause of my anxiety, hence the need to keep it away from him)."
1139,"I had a therapist but shortly after losing my job he admitted to ""pitching his tent"" on the other side of the desk during a session."
1140,I agreed to and started therapy a few weeks ago.
1141,Did you use a medication in conjunction with any other type of therapy?
1142,Hey guys i've been suffering heavy anxiety over the last 6 months and i've finally decided to try medication since therapy didnt seem to really work.
1143,"I ended up going to see a therapist, she was helpful I got to vent my feelings and she gave me good tips to surviving a panic attack when I get another one."
1144,"(I've never had panic attacks like that, idk if this was even a panic attack but either way it made me feel really crazy) 

This post was long, probably too long and I'm sorry for that but I feel like no matter how many therapists I talk to, no matter how many drugs I take, I'm still fucked."
1145,"I'd still have anxiety attacks every once in a while (going to parties, or movie theatres, having sex, etc) and when they started to become more frequent I'd always go back to my therapist and she'd prescribe me a higher dosage."
1146,"Tomorrow I have a consultation for meds, then therapy, then an appointment with my doctor to prescribe the actual medications."
1147,"I still would go to therapy, and it has helped me to feel better temporarily and during some panic attacks."
1148,"I have to write a story about my life for my psychologist, so we can do EMDR with it and I will maybe be doing some group-therapy for the anxiety, but it will take a few months till there is a spot open..."
1149,"The last time I saw a therapist, I lied to him."
1150,"Though maybe not, i have no idea what testosterone therapy entails."
1151,I was days away from asking my parents to pay for therapy before my dad quit his job.
1152,So I went in to see a therapist at kaiser a few months ago for trichotillomania (hair-pulling) and dermatillamania (skin-picking) that I've had since I was a child.
1153,During my appointment I brought up that I was raped five years ago - suddenly this was all my therapist wanted to talk about.
1154,She referred me to a psychiatrist who I have seen several times since then - I have not gone back to see the original therapist.
1155,Kaiser doesn't do long term individual therapy so she suggested I join the OCD therapy group that meets once a week.
1156,In order to be considered for the group you have to go see an anxiety therapist who needs to give you a referral for whichever group you want to join.
1157,I did this last week and once the therapist saw the notes in my file from my first therapy appointment all he wanted to do was talk about my assault.
1158,He was very pushy about how I had to be in regular therapy because of my assault and that I had to join the PTSD group.
1159,He made me call up my original therapist (who also leads the PTSD group) and schedule an appointment with her in front of him because he (correctly) believed I wouldn't do it later.
1160,"He gave me a referral to the OCD group in the end, but he was very adamant that I NEED to be in therapy because of my assault."
1161,"I started to see a therapist, and I am a little anxious about it."
1162,I take Xanax as needed for anxiety and I've just started seeing a therapist again.
1163,"Yes, I'm going to start therapy again because I'm really sick of it- just thought I'd hit you guys up for input as a test drive of sorts first."
1164,"I went on medication and started therapy, and things got a lot better."
1165,I can't even tell my therapist these things before he seems visibly annoyed.
1166,I tried therapy for 6 months combined with celexa and it made no difference.
1167,"I have already taken Xanax and tried the breathing techniques given to me by my therapist, but I can't seem to calm down."
1168,"The receptionist said a therapist would call me back within 1-2 business days and set me up with an appointment, which could be in about a week to a week and a half."
1169,My primary doctor is open tomorrow.. should I call in the morning and try to make an appointment to talk with my doctor and tell her that I just couldn't wait for a therapist?
1170,Okay so part of my therapy homework in order to tackle my perfectionism and anxiety is to try and deliberately make mistakes in order to expose myself to them and realize they're not bad.
1171,"Just as a disclaimer, I have seen a private cognitive behavioural therapist for just under 2 years (?)"
1172,"**What I have learnt and some possible solutions**

I started working with a therapist in the summer after my first failed third year of study."
1173,I discussed all these issues with the therapist and he didn't feel these at all related to my difficulties.
1174,"I was worried when working through this therapy about bipolar conditions as a result, but am told that that happens when the two parts of your brain start to work against each other, and “become” separate people”."
1175,"I can’t help but think about a therapist sitting there listening to me and thinking “SNOOOOOOORE” while I blather on, and medicine is last resort for me, so I really want to start with some good reading."
1176,"I have a mild panic disorder and have made real progress in the past few years with therapy and meds, but I did have another panic attack last night after fighting with family."
1177,"I've been in the hospital, done the therapies, gone through the different drugs."
1178,"Well, her mom is taking us on a road trip a few states away so her and I can get training on some new therapy programs for the child I nanny."
1179,These 'visions' as my psychotherapist calls them (they're not hallucinations because I don't believe they're real?
1180,"My psychotherapist wishes to take me off the Aripiprazole in the near future, against my wishes to stay on it."
1181,"I'm not in a position to change psychotherapists, as I'm on the NHS service, CAHMS (being under 18, myself), and in my region the psychotherapists that are around are stretched very thin."
1182,next week to discuss this as my therapist is a Ph.D).
1183,"I was in therapy from the age of 14 - 23, and on anti-depressants &amp; mood-stabilising drugs during that same period too."
1184,"The therapy didn't help, the drugs didn't help."
1185,"Finally I got medication and therapy, and they seemed to help, but it's like a xenomorph: constantly evolving and finding better ways to kill me."
1186,"One might suggest that she see a therapist, and this would be very good advice, if a therapist wasn't also an agent of change, and so one of inevitable disaster, the kind where suddenly and without warning the whole world will shatter into a billion pieces."
1187,"Visit my old therapist, who hasn't been that great with handling my issues (I want to get a new one)."
1188,I just need help and reassurance that I am going to be fine and I am seeing a therapist tomorrow.
1189,Then I came to the conclusion he might be doing that EMDR type therapy?
1190,"&gt;The therapist works gently with the client, guiding him or her to revisit the traumatic incident."
1191,"I'm not sure how I feel, I think this therapy stuff will be good but part me is afraid of it."
1192,"Like I'm going to go to the counseling center and the therapist will be like, ""Don't be ridiculous, you're just being stupid"" (of course in a nicer, more professional way)."
1193,I've seen some people post on here similar things about making calls and also anxiety preventing them from making an appointment with a therapist.
1194,"**TL;DR: Had 1st talk with therapist, it felt nice but afterwards I felt like we had the wrong focus and I'm worried I gave her the wrong impression about my issues."
1195,"** 

I had my first meeting with a therapist a couple of days ago, and while it was nice to just talk, I felt like we focused on the wrong issues and that she steered the talk in a direction I didn't quite agree with."
1196,"But those of you that have been in therapy, **exactly how did you resolve your issues?"
1197,I also ran this situation by my therapist and she said it didn't sound like I had anything to worry about.
1198,"I moved away from my old therapist and need to find a new one (hopefully things will get better once that happens), but for now, I'm wigging out, and I don't know how to make it stop."
1199,"So yeah, I have been visiting a therapist for about 3 months now."
1200,"I usually try to battle the agorophobia several times a week, with taking the bus to my city, where my therapist is."
1201,"I actually made an effort and went and saw a therapist but it didn't stick, granted I only went once."
1202,About six months ago I went to a therapist for my anxiety- which had been getting worse as time went on.
1203,I usually put a facade of acting like everything is okay and I did that with my therapist.
1204,"I know that I want to open to my therapist, but I'm afraid I'll do the same thing because I'm afraid of letting someone else into my anxiety."
1205,"So, this is something my therapist made me do a few weeks ago and it really helped me."
1206,"So, my situation is atm: I'm attend a weekly group-therapy session and I have an issue I want to talk about."
1207,My question is: Am I able to talk about this in the group-therapy session without one of the therapists taking action?
1208,"It doesn't affect the relationship other than it bothers me, she tells me she's unaffected by it (she has an unbelievably strong mentality), and I want to bring it up in group-therapy but I'm not sure if the therapists will take action considering my girlfriend doesn't want to take action."
1209,She advocated that I take medication with my therapy at first but I was stubborn and refused.
1210,So I got a therapist.
1211,Is there some type of therapy that can help me with this so i can have normal relationships?
1212,"I have sought therapy and have taken lithium for this, but nothing has worked."
1213,I am going to therapy.
1214,I have been in therapy for a year and on prozac since may for my severe anxiety and persistent depressive disorder.
1215,"He held me while I cried and begged me to go to therapy, or the hospital, or just call my mom."
1216,I was in therapy the next week.
1217,I was doing well in classes and therapy was great.
1218,"I was stressed and worried, but my therapist told me that the fact that I wasn't hiding from it, that I was up and looking for places rather than lying in bed, meant that I can handle this."
1219,"A few weeks ago, we made a breakthrough in therapy that has made everything so amazingly crystal clear."
1220,I decided to look for a pyschotherapist and now I wrote an email asking about an appointment.
1221,Going to a therapist seems so unreal to me.
1222,"He was very helpful to me and quickly attempted to treat my anxiety with a type of therapy (I don't remember what), and my mom refused it."
1223,I'll probably bring this up to my therapist when I go for the first time next week.
1224,"My meds, my doctor, my therapist...nothing is helping."
1225,"In the end I realised I needed a break, and after some intense therapy, decided to move to live with my SO overseas for a few months."
1226,I'm quite sure I have an anxiety disorder (therapist will hopefully confirm in 2 weeks) and I'm thinking ADHD wouldn't be too surprising either.
1227,"I've been seeing a therapist for several months now and have found her very helpful, but I'm not moving fast enough, and she encouraged me to see a psychiatrist to deal mainly with the physical symptoms."
1228,"Anyway, I'm just really nervous about it, I guess partially because I'm so comfortable with my therapist and I'm worried I won't like the psychiatrist as much."
1229,"I've had some bad therapists in the past, so that doesn't make me feel any better."
1230,None of them even know I'm in therapy.
1231,"I was in therapy for awhile, great therapy, and it helped so much."
1232,I have ocd with health phobias (which my old therapist said was different from hypochondria).
1233,I'm debating going to a clinic today to see a doctor to just try to get a referally to a cheap therapist or something.
1234,"She's also helping em try to sign up for Obama care, and she's going to help me find some therapy I can afford here."
1235,"I did not feel comfortable with the last therapist I went to, and it will take about 4 - 5 months until I get an appointment with different one."
1236,"About 2 years ago when I was still at school, and had a therapist at my disposal, I frequently would see her."
1237,We tried to get her to see a therapist - who she then shades the truth with - and then claims that she already knows all of this - it doesn't work - so why bother.
1238,"An emergency room doctor, a school therapist, and a couple psychologists."
1239,"I didn't want to believe I was ""crazy"" therefore I refused proper therapy."
1240,I'm on a waiting list for a 12 week therapy program to help combat my worries.
1241,I've never been to therapy or anything.
1242,"I've been to a therapist a couple of times, but I'm managing rather well on my own and with the support of my significant other."
1243,"I tried seeing a therapist a few weeks ago, but it didn't help."
1244,"It has taken therapy, medication and a lot of willpower on my behalf to make even the smallest changes in my communicative and cognitive behavioral habits."
1245,"I started seeing a therapist (for CBT), started working out, and I finally realized that I avoid everything that gives me anxiety or potentially could make me feel anything."
1246,With my therapists help I have accepted those feelings and challenged my perfectionism enough to (partially) complete my resume but I'm still struggling.
1247,My therapist has helped me with my motivation and my perfectionism but I still feel stuck and afraid.
1248,I don't know if I should wait until I start an antidepressant and then look for a job or start apply now and hopefully be able to cope with the stress with just my therapist.
1249,"He has just started therapy and drug treatment combined and it's working, but it's still the first stages."
1250,"I was diagnosed with OCD and Dermatillomania at 16 and I'm 22 now, and my process was much smoother than his; I got help with medicine and therapy right away and I have an extremely supportive family, while his is supportive but misinformed and closed."
1251,"The thing I'm asking is, I'm a lot farther along in the journey of recovery than he is; I'm not acting as his therapist, because he has his own, but he's having a hard time right now, and while I remember what I needed to hear during that time when I was there and I remember how I felt, I know that the disorder is different for everyone."
1252,I go to therapy and take drugs but i'm really only depressed because of how terrible this all has been.
1253,"It's gotten to the point where I can't even make appointments with my therapist, or hang out with friends."
1254,"In the meantime, I had been researching local therapists who are covered by my insurance and working up to finally setting an appointment."
1255,"I've never been to anyone regarding my mental health before this, so it's all new to me, but I knew there was a possibility it might take a while for me to find the right therapist for me."
1256,"But the more this therapist talked, the more it was clear she was directly correlating my lack of relationships to my weight (and completely disregarding the social anxiety I told her I recently realized I'd dealt with for as long as I could remember), even going so far as to say, ""I'm sure you wouldn't want to go out with someone who's overweight and doesn't work on their appearance."""
1257,"I'm new to this, but I figured I would do most of the talking and that the therapist would ask questions to help get a fuller picture of my struggles -- similar to my experiences with the intake interview I did at my job's Employee Assistance Program and my first session with the psychologist I saw there."
1258,But I barely got to cover any of that because the therapist talked for most of the time.
1259,"TL;DR: Like the title of my post suggests, I had a disappointing first session with a therapist."
1260,"I guess I'm just looking to know I'm not overreacting, and also seeking advice on how to use this experience to better feel out other therapists before making a new appointment."
1261,"I was too nervous to really ask this therapist any questions before making the appointment, just hoped for the best."
1262,"But before spending another $40 on a copay for another therapist who clearly isn't right for me, I thought I'd see what advice y'all might have in terms of things to ask on the phone."
1263,"Back when I was seeing a psychiatrist and therapist they BOTH told me and my parents that because my anxiety is so severe, they don't believe I am going to recover fully unless I live in a peaceful relaxing household."
1264,I may talk to my therapist about it as well.
1265,"Have you thought of harming yourself daily because the idea of leaving your house and dealing with a job, something that apparently everyone else in the world can deal with without psych meds, therapy and tears, is too much to deal with at least 3 times a week?"
1266,I've been seeing a therapist (LCSW) for a couple of months now.
1267,"Last night, I came to therapy with the same litany of problems - immediate, near-sighted problems: Worried about a possible new relationship, worried about sexual performance, stressed out by work and life in general."
1268,"I've talked to my therapist and I have an appointment with my psychiatrist soon, but I have a feeling he is going to prescribe me something different."
1269,"However, I sought therapy (CBT) which I found helpful."
1270,"I apologize for the rant, but there's a lot on my mind and I don't see my therapist for another couple of days."
1271,"So I've been seeing a therapist for a few months now and while she has helped a little during my last session she concluded that I should be taking the xanax that I have more often and that I should start by taking it two to three times a day for two weeks ""just to see."""
1272,I don't really know if I should take her advice and was wondering if I should seek a different therapist.
1273,"My therapist was going over deep breathing/relaxation techniques with me at my session tonight, really emphasizing relaxation."
1274,Yesterday I had my first psychotherapy session and my therapist read me like a book.
1275,"I have come to the point where I don't trust therapists anymore, and I desperately need CBT to get out of my current way of thinking."
1276,"The one therapist who I do trust, but unfortunately he has gotten too old to properly help patients, is Nathaniel Branden."
1277,"I plan on doing the CBT work myself since I can't find a reliable therapist, so I would like to know from personal experience if any of you have found something that works, or if this kind of thing would be sufficient for CBT."
1278,He is in therapy and takes medication somewhat regularly.
1279,"I am fully recovered from my fucking awful mental illnesses, but I wouldn't have been able to do that without group therapy."
1280,"Here's why group therapy works: ""You control, and are ultimately responsible for, what, how much, and when you tell the group about yourself."
1281,Group therapy is often more enriching for some than individual therapy.
1282,"Currently, group therapy on average costs $50 per session."
1283,We are making an app for anonymous group therapy that's as cheap as Spotify premium.
1284,"Essentially, you'd be able to sign up for chat/audio group therapy led by other users who've gone through whatever you are going through now."
1285,i think i will try some Logotherapy and always ask me what could happend in the worst case?
1286,I asked my doctor (I did not go so far as to visit a therapist – just making a doctor’s appointment is a lot for me) what she could give me.
1287,"Has meditation, yoga, hypnotherapy, etc worked?"
1288,"I don't even go to my favorite websites pertaining to the subjects anymore, which use to be one of my biggest therapy methods during school."
1289,"Or I would tell myself ""it's not so bad, you are overreacting, others have it much worse then you"" and talk myself out of going to the school therapist."
1290,"Every single day I feel sick, because apparently (according to my therapist/doctor) the anxiety altered my gastrointestinal system."
1291,"So I can't take medication, meditation doesn't help, and the therapy doesn't seem to stick with me."
1292,Am currently in therapy and am trying to use CBT stuff but it doesn't always help.
1293,Exposure therapy!
1294,(I do all the normal therapy stuff...being seeing a therapist for 8 years)
1295,"My therapist suggested seeking medication, something I was deathly afraid of."
1296,"I postponed, hoping the therapy would work and I would turn the corner."
1297,"Throughout the incident last year up until now, I've been doing regular weekly therapy sessions, and recently picked up a good therapist in our new home city."
1298,Okay so I've been wanting to go to therapy for about a year now.
1299,So I've decided to be proactive &amp; look for a therapist.
1300,I just need help with how to search for a good therapist that will work on sliding scale.
1301,"I confided in friends and family, was open about it all and went to therapy."
1302,"Therapist wasn't the best so I found a new one, still nothing although I feel hopeful (still my current therapist.)"
1303,I have been having therapy and doing depression workshops and my depression has really lifted.
1304,"I am more anxious than ever, and having some follow up therapy and CBT to begin to attack this."
1305,"I've recently lost my job 
through sheer agoraphobia which is a 
byproduct of my GAD, and I just feel so alone and pathetic,, I'm on tablets which I 
feel do nothing, I'm in two different types of 
therapy (cognitive and emotional) and I just feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel."
1306,"(heart racing,light headed, breathing issues,arms and legs shaking and numb/tingling) I've started therapy with someone at the clinic here and I'll have another appt with them soon, but is there anything I can do in the meantime to take my mind off of having another panic attack?"
1307,"But, I quickly remembered meditation techniques my therapist gave me, and I also looked at my notes of positive thoughts, and I fought it off."
1308,I had never been to a therapist or a clinic before.
1309,I started seeing a therapist as well as the mental health clinic and she told me that she thought my problems were mostly anxiety and recommended neurofeedback.
1310,"My therapist says that the ""feeling"" is just my anxiety, but it's a completely different feeling."
1311,This isn't the first time this has happened to me (probably not even the hundredth at this point...) and I think it's time I start going to therapy but there's a large part of me that can't accept that something serious isn't actually wrong with me medically.
1312,"I have OCD and severe anxiety, and am seeing a therapist for those very issues."
1313,"My anxiety has gotten much, much better since starting therapy, but there is one thing I can't seem to shake."
1314,"My therapist says that I don't validate my own emotions, and I completely agree."
1315,"My Story:

I've gone to therapy for OCD since I was ~10, now 25."
1316,I've been in this loop and working with a therapist on and off the whole time.
1317,"But so far, I feel like I've gotten nothing out of therapy."
1318,The 'rabbit in the headlights' feeling my therapist described.
1319,"I have always experienced a moderate amount of anxiety when dealing with social situations since I was a child, but with the help of therapy and CBT I have been able to quell most of my fears when engaging in social situations except for one, checking Facebook."
1320,"So basically, I showed up, talked to the therapist about my week for a few mins while he set things up (got the induction script out, set up some white-noise), and then we started."
1321,"I'm nervous alone in talking to my doctor, I've feared it for looking like some pill fiend....my dad was a severe manic depressive/bipolar - even been in mental health places and recieved shock therapy and that terrifies me more if i dont do anything about this."
1322,"With a little refresher from my CBT therapist, I am back to life within a couple months at most."
1323,I'm still mustering up the courage to see a therapist (my first experience was not great).
1324,"After years of no insurance, I will finally be able to see a therapist next month."
1325,"I recently started somatic therapy, and I've already had some great insight from it."
1326,"I've had issues with anxiety for as long as I can remember, but I've never seen a therapist about it."
1327,I was constantly in a state of anxiety and had constant panic attacks to the point that I got a therapist and began medication.
1328,"I was thinking about showing this to my therapist later on (or at least reading it to him), but I wanted to know if anyone has experience anything similar?"
1329,"Part of the problem of my anxiety is it's hard to put it into words to describe to someone, which is why I have resisted going to a therapist."
1330,I'm starting with a new therapist this week and I'm currently not medicating my condition.
1331,"I decided to give therapy a chance, after 20 years of not going."
1332,I finally have good insurance that covers most of the therapy costs.
1333,I researched CBT trained therapists in my city.
1334,"Last wekk after only 4 visits, my therapist said that I need to find a new therapist."
1335,"She claimed that CBT will not work for me, and that I need to find a therapist trained in DBT, after she had done research on it."
1336,"I feel hopeless, and afraid to contact any of the therapist that my former therapist recommended to me."
1337,"I recently got insurance and I do plan on getting to a therapist and eventually getting medicated if that's what they think is best, but unfortunately I don't think two weeks is enough time to get that all sorted."
1338,I have different cases of anxiety on file at the doctors office and years of psycho therapy.
1339,I am seeing multiple therapists and doctors and am on meds but it just isn't getting better.
1340,I have an extreme fear of throwing up that I'm working with s therapist to overcome.
1341,Did your therapists approve of this decision?
1342,I want to seek help of a psychologist or therapist but am scared to..My whole family should go to counselling but there is slim chance that anyone would go willingly.
1343,"Up until that point, I was SUPER against taking medication, but things were getting out of control (clearly) and just therapy wasn't working."
1344,"During that period where I went off my medication, I was also not in therapy at all, and I ended up going to the walk in crisis centre as I was having anxiety attacks and the heart palpitations were coming back and I was feeling suicidal."
1345,"I'm currently scheduled to go to some cognitive behavioral therapy or something like that, but I feel like that won't help."
1346,I realize now that I need to see a therapist...but it's too late for this trip.
1347,"Basically, I'm kind of stuck because after I got out of the psych ward and abusive group a few years ago  my therapists abandoned me because I ""wasn't traumatized enough."""
1348,"I'm to the point where I have been sick for about a oslid year now with a severe sinus infection and my gum lines are receeding (wisdom teeth may be causing infection too) I can't go to the doctor or hospital becuase

I'm going ot order al ot of books from amazon soon to learn how to do cognative behavoiral therapy myself."
1349,"I took medication back in my early middle school days for like a month, then I tried a few therapists since then and I didn't really like it at all."
1350,"My therapist told me that I can't and shouldn't compare my life to what I learn in school, because it's the norm and my life is not normal."
1351,"I'm in therapy now for anxiety, but it doesn't seem to be all to helping with the throat."
1352,I was seeing a therapist for a short time but the sessions really didn't seem to help.
1353,My new years resolution is to find a new therapist and get back to where I was before or at least somewhat back.
1354,"I've since learned to manage my anxiety free of drugs &amp; therapy, but recently I've had a recurrence with my face falling asleep."
1355,"It's going to be a few weeks until I can find a therapist, so any tips on how to deal?"
1356,"I had my first therapy in 1½ years last week and it felt good, but I still feel hopeless."
1357,"I'm going through the hardest thing I've ever been through and I need to discuss it/vent and receive positive input from any psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, or just people in general."
1358,I have an appointment with a therapist in two days and an appointment with a psychiatrist in 25 days.
1359,I don't have a car at school and the place that offers therapy is a $40 taxi ride every week that I can't afford.
1360,So next week we're going to look into a different doctor and maybe a therapist.
1361,"I saw my therapist yesterday and she helped me to understand that I felt ""alone"" instead of ""lonely,"" which is true - I'm surrounded by people who want to help but nothing they do or say makes me feel any better (even my therapist I guess - I feel good for about a half hour after I leave her office and then I just feel awful again and can't execute any techniques)."
1362,He says he does not want to take any medication and believes therapy will not help him.
1363,"Together we worked through different therapists, therapies, and many different harmful drugs, there was self harm, attacks on me, suicide bids, being sectioned all sorts."
1364,I did see a therapist and it helped a lot.
1365,I went to a massage therapist that claims to be Shaolin Temple trained.
1366,"My mom spoke to them about it, and they said I should give group therapy a few weeks and in the end medication is an option."
1367,"I'm not going to go in and have someone stare at me like I'm crazy and say, ""Well, I'm not a doctor, and I can't give you medication, but I am a counselor and can help with talk therapy so lets try..."" again."
1368,"It gets in the way of so much I want to do, and even on medication and seeing a therapist, it's a steep, uphill battle."
1369,After showing my therapist and a few other people the writings they have said that the message really demonstrates how confusing social interaction can be and that more people should be exposed to it.
1370,Now I'm back at my high-pressure NYC school and have to meet with an academic coach 3 times a week (plus 2-hour study hall on Sundays) and therapy twice a week just to stay afloat.
1371,"I haven't given myself a break from the city or school at all since I took a January class over winter break, and all these appointments + commute time (coach and therapist are far from where I live) feels equivalent to committing to a part-time job."
1372,"I've always felt like I've had some sort of anxiety problem, but I've never had anything diagnosed or gone to a therapist."
1373,At this point I am seriously considering trying a therapist.
1374,However with therapy and medication it's gotten much better and these sorts of attacks are very rare for me now.
1375,"So, aside from ranting, I'm just wondering, **what do you normally experience when it comes to counsellors, therapists or psychologists?"
1376,"I've contemplated going to therapy repeatedly, but never followed through with."
1377,I would love to hear from everyone about how therapy has or hasn't helped you out with your anxiety problems.
1378,With therapy and medicine I managed to pick everything back up and felt really stable.
1379,To further investigate my problems my therapist has given me some books to read.
1380,"By the way: I will discuss all of this with my therapist, I am only looking for some input on where to look for further information on how to sort my shit out until the next appointment."
1381,I'm a student and I don't have the money to pay for therapy and I need a doctor to refer me so my school health insurance will cover it.
1382,"TL;DR: I'm scared my social anxiety has gotten out of control, and my doctor doesn't believe me and I can't afford therapy without her reference."
1383,"Since I'm under 18 (16), my therapist said I couldn't get the whole dosage, otherwise it would cause problems with my other meds and my body especially."
1384,"Here I am waking up to a terrible panic attack despite great access to regular therapy, medication and working out."
1385,I should schedule therapy and actually go.
1386,"I've been in therapy for around six months now, and in some ways it has helped a lot."
1387,"When I bring up the anxiety angle, she says I'm using it as an excuse and that since I've started therapy, I make excuses even more often."
1388,"I won't have health insurance for another month and so I can't get therapy, which I desperately need, until then."
1389,I thought I would ask for help here though to get me through this next month so I don't lose my job due to not being able to afford therapy.
1390,"Don't ask me how, but through self-therapy that took a year, I was able to fix the thought blocking, and brain fog."
1391,I'm on meds and am in therapy now.
1392,I was diagnosed last week after talking to a therapist for a couple weeks and she suggested i talk to a psychiatrist.
1393,"I'm medicated and I see my therapist twice a month, but mom and dad are my main support."
1394,"Notes to myself, inspirational things, cognitive behavioral therapy, etc."
1395,"I can't afford therapy, or a psych, or anything."
1396,"Tomorrow, I'm going to call my university to set up an appointment with a therapist."
1397,Can anyone give me any information about having a therapy dog?
1398,"1. wished massage therapy was covered by your insurance, because, you rationalize, it's cheaper than drugs and you don't have to take it orally."
1399,1. tried aromatherapy but then panicked wondering what the hell you were breathing into your lungs?
1400,"I tried therapy and the guy just highlighted my problems ( I think that having the therapy made me realise it was very real where as before I could ignore i had this anxiety so it appears to have made it worse ) 

If I have an event to attend to i will avoid eating during the day for fear of bringing my meal up in front of people."
1401,"My wife was diagnosed with GAD over a year ago, and after a few false starts with therapists, she clicked with one and things started getting better."
1402,"I've been from pillar to post trying everything from the linden method, self-help books, stress pills, therapy, visualization, etc."
1403,"I was even semi-aware of it because I went to a counseling session at my university, I couldn't articulate how I felt properly, but that idiot therapist recommended I go and talk to a philosopher."
1404,"I've been seeing a therapist whose been helpful, but I need help."
1405,"If anyone is interested, the next few months I have intensive therapy."
1406,How do you feel about group therapy?
1407,"I'm scared because, although my problems seem terrible for me because I experience them, with group therapy it will just sound like I'm whining."
1408,I feel like... Group therapy will be like that and that I will feel so stupid amidst people with real and tragic problems and I will be just some weird person that cannot figure out how to function despite being given nearly every advantage.
1409,I've already had intake appointments with both a Psychiatrist and a therapist and tomorrow I have my first real therapy session tomorrow.
1410,My girlfriend told me to put together a list of things I want to talk to the therapist about like anxiety attacks and severe lack of motivation.
1411,"already see a therapist, have been for over a year now."
1412,His once a week therapy doesn't seem to have done much so far (4 months in).
1413,"While I cannot speak to whether I’d respond positively to the treatment you recommend, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, I can explain why I have difficulty approaching any form of therapy."
1414,"As the title says, my friend from group therapy has been texting me that she was going to kill herself."
1415,"Take steps to improve, whether it be therapy or whatever you are referred to by others who have mastered the art of rationalization."
1416,Let me preface this by saying I've never had therapy until my anxiety.
1417,I started seeing a therapist once a week a few months ago.
1418,Then I went to a group therapy today and we spoke about past traumas.
1419,"From all the abuse, lying, cheating, stealing, and manipulation, I developed quite a plethora of anxiety disorders (that I was told by a therapist that I should probably be medicated for)."
1420,I'm currently working with a therapist and I've come a long way.
1421,"SSRIs have helped, cognitive therapy has helped."
1422,"My therapist has suggested xanax on an ""as needed"" basis."
1423,"I went to therapy, but once results started to show and I grew to be somewhat normal, I stopped going to counseling."
1424,I have been having pretty rough patches of anxiety on and off for the past few months and my therapist suggested I make an appointment with a psychiatrist to talk about medication.
1425,I actually don't want to take medication much at all...but I have been seeing limited progress with my therapist (we are speaking tomorrow to discuss a new plan of action or the possibility of me finding a new therapist) and there have been enough times lately where I am non-functioning enough that I kinda relented and decided to consider it.
1426,"I am wondering if I should have started with something like Buspar (which he suggested, as well) and more therapy (perhaps starting some CBT therapy) before jumping straight to the Cymbalta?"
1427,"How I did it: 
My therapist has been very helpful in letting me recognise my anxious thoughts, and how to replace them with more positive and logical points."
1428,"I have done therapy before, I know the mental triggers where the anxiety kicks in and I tell myself that it's nothing to worry about but when it comes to that my body had already reacted and it's too late."
1429,The anxiety seemed to lessen as I talked things out with my therapist.
1430,"(pardon my French)

Ah, &amp; my therapist is on vacation, can't get in for another month."
1431,"I spoke with a therapist about it but she told me to ""stop being so irrational."""
1432,I will go in group-therapy and probably also one-on-one therapy.
1433,"I've spent the year doing voluntary work and have felt good most of the time 

Now I've got to think about going back to uni and starting to feel overwhelmed again 

I've just got a job with the aim of spending the extra income on private therapy but finding a therapist is terrifying 

I googled ""therapy in [my city]"" and found a website which allows you to search therapists 


But there's so many different types of therapy and so many therapists and they all look so serious and a lot of them need a phone call to make an appointment 


I'm feeling a bit lost in all this and I can feel my brain trying to abandon the whole thing but I'm desperate to make headway in my mental state before I go back to uni and unravel again and a little help would be appreciated 

How do you find a therapist?"
1434,"For the longest time I thought it was a weird phobia, but after experiencing some other anxiety and talking about it with my therapist I realized it's more of an anxiety trigger."
1435,And according to my therapist it's not a common one and possibly coming from a suppresed trauma.
1436,I wish I had a therapist again (have had a couple in the past) but I don't and I am feeling very overwhelmed right now.
1437,My therapist says my fears are irrational but I don't believe her or anybody.
1438,"My therapist says I'm progressing in some ways, but I feel like I'm still stuck in the darkness I've been dealing with for months now."
1439,"I'm doing everything I can to stay relaxed and healthy (therapy, medication, etc."
1440,"I went to a school counselor who got me a consultation with an actual therapist, who told me I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder."
1441,Enough that I am going to my doctor to see if I can have some therapy as I think the only way of understanding and controlling this is to get a profesional deep understanding of where this worry and neurotic attitude comes from.
1442,"I did set up an appointment with a therapist but it's not until October 30th, which can be a long time for these kind of things."
1443,"I'm seriously considering therapy and getting on a new medication (currently taking sertraline, which is zoloft ?)"
1444,"I've always had it like this as far back as I can remember, so it's not a new thing, and I don't know if it's something CBT or therapy in general would help much with."
1445,Through blahtherapy.com (thank you to whoever posted about it in here recently!
1446,"It's amazing to realize this through blahtherapy, but I'm wondering if you all have suggestions for this."
1447,"The thing is, the only thing the therapist (he was an accredited psychologist btw) wanted to talk about was events long past that really didn't carry any emotional weight anymore."
1448,After doing some research I saw that there isn't much evidence that a psychoanalytic approach to therapy is helpful for social anxiety and I became very cynical towards the whole counseling center.
1449,"I'm ready to seek outside help now, but the only people who now know about my anxiety are myself, my academic counselor, and a therapist with a penchant for psychoanalysis down at the school's counseling center."
1450,"I want to get help but it seems like a catch 22 for me, talk to a person about how I can't talk to people aha..
 
Also, i've looked into it, and on the NHS the main initial treatment is CBT, and me and my bf have tried very much so to do what that kind of therapy involves, and it's just getting worse."
1451,"ranting is just all I can do right now, I don't have my next therapy appointment until Sat."
1452,"I do have a therapist, psychd and a psychologist that I use sparingly; my therapist thinks my world is filled with unicorns and mommy-daughter playtime because I'm too afraid to tell anyone just how isolated, anxious and sad I've become."
1453,"I have an appointment scheduled with my psychiatrist where I will be seeking a referral to therapy and other professional help, but that's not for another few weeks."
1454,"Furthermore, if I get the job, how will I be able to have time to see my psychiatrist and therapist?"
1455,Started researching into therapists in the area I'm moving to but haven't had a chance to contact any of them yet.
1456,"I began taking medication in March and started seeing my therapist regularly, which allowed me to do ""normal"" things again."
1457,"I've been in and out of outpatient therapy since I was 18, usually at my university health center."
1458,I started a new course of therapy in July with a new psychiatrist and therapist since I can no longer see my past therapists due to leaving school.
1459,The psychiatrist switched my meds from Celexa to Pristiq and I've had three sessions of talk therapy for 45 minutes each.
1460,I usually can only see my therapist every three or four weeks and my psychiatrist every three months.
1461,The med change has made a huge difference and therapy has helped some.
1462,"I feel like all I do in my therapy sessions is just catch my therapist up on what I've been doing in the month since I saw her, briefly talk about my moods, and then watch her make notes in my treatment plan."
1463,I had several panic attacks today and my dad mentioned that I might try changing therapists or getting more intensive treatment because 45 minutes of talk therapy a month doesn't seem to be cutting it.
1464,Do I just be blunt with my therapist?
1465,"She is really the only person I talk to about things, other than a weekly therapist visit."
1466,"I've had a couple different therapists but I never feel like I am comfortable with them, or that they are asking the right questions."
1467,"I want help so badly, I want to be able to tell my therapists everything, but I just can't."
1468,"All I am saying is that people should be informed of BOTH options - therapy and meds, rather than just meds] ***"
1469,"However, I've also been in therapy for 2 years to deal with anxiety and depression."
1470,"I started therapy because I suddenly looked at my bf one day and had a panic attack about him, wondering if I really loved him, etc."
1471,"Last night’s therapy appointment regarding this subject caused another panic attack and caused me to have a terrible night’s sleep with feeling hot, then cold, heart pounding, shaking, racing thoughts… and it’s not much better today."
1472,"We were together until recently, she broke up with me because she wanted to sort our her various issues without always relying on me

While obviously it hurts, I want to be supportive and so was wondering if anyone had any advice with how to at least make things a bit easier for her as at the moment all I've ever been able to do is tell her ""It's going to be ok""

We're both 18 and she's not on any medication; she's been diagnosed by her doctor but the only thing they prescribed her were phone call appointments with a therapist, which she dislikes and some sort of weekly group sessions that she only went to one of because it was not for her

I just want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to help her even as only her friend."
1473,She's started seeing a therapist and taking xanax (I think) but the therapist is currently on vacation and she isn't doing well... not to mention that therapy in general is a slow process and every day is an uphill battle.
1474,"Anyways, I was going to a doctor and was on a waiting list for a therapist, I’ve been through plenty of meds for depression and anxiety, my last prescription I’ve taken was a generic clonazepam, or k-pin."
1475,"I don’t take them anymore because I had moved and I don’t have health insurance for a doctor, I never got a therapist."
1476,I know someone will tell me to meet a therapist or psychiatrist.
1477,"My therapist wants me to practice exposure therapy and force myself into these social environments that set me off and not leave until my SUDS (level of anxiety) score drops to a comfortable level, but I start finding excuses to not go."
1478,"Surfing through this subreddit and i constantly see people who are saying that due to their current financial situations, they have a very limited access to resources like drugs and therapy."
1479,I've seen therapists regularly and have been on and off of antidepressants and anti anxiety meds.
1480,"Should I try to see a counselor, a psychiatrist, or a therapist?"
1481,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
1482,"Makes me think the way I've been approaching it (continuing trying to be social, wellbutrin, psychotherapy, physical exercise, reading relevant books) is not fully reaching this seemingly force that is rooted deep within."
1483,so i have a generalized anxiety disorder and i've been in therapy for a little over a year now.
1484,"I love to read and write, so my therapist suggested I write sort of a ""life story"" of where I've been, where I'm at, and where I hope to go."
1485,"Anyway, I was diagnosed with social anxiety about 5 years ago and I had a couple of sessions of hypnotherapy."
1486,I am hoping to get answer back from my therapist from a year ago as well soon but no news on when I'll see that email.
1487,I am seeing a therapist and I have been doing slightly better but tonight I am having a rough go of things.
1488,"I have to put all of my energy into developing coping skills while working with therapists, and hopefully - within a year - be in a position to enter the work force once more."
1489,It's just hard for me to accept that and he also suggested that if a therapist could help me if I continue to have high anxiety.
1490,I'm going for my first therapy session in about three weeks and honestly I'm completely ready for it because it'll be my first step in taking my life back.
1491,But I don't know what to expect really or how to talk to my therapist.
1492,"Several therapists (not seeing one now) have told me that what I have isn't chemical, but may be hormonal, and to try to get bloodwork once I'm on insurance again (which I finally am)."
1493,It got a little better with some therapy throughout middle school and then I moved on to high school.
1494,"I called a therapist yesterday which will hopefully help me out, but I remain skeptical just because of how many I went through in middle school before finding someone that kinda helped."
1495,Any suggestions on what I should do or what medications or therapies have worked best for you I would love to hear!
1496,"So I've gone to therapy for a little while now (for various reasons other than anxiety), and each of my therapists mentioned anxiety, but I always brushed it off and denied it."
1497,I've been reading a self-help book on ACT (Acceptance and Commitment therapy) and it's been helping little by little.
1498,"Recently they've said they'll get me a therapist, but when I asked them if they would try to diagnose me they said, "" I don't know, you're just going to talk with them."""
1499,"Also they said I had to find the therapist myself online, which I don't really want to do in fear of fucking up."
1500,"I called a therapist, and while he was very helpful, he told me he was worried about my financial situation and that he wants to find another counselor with much lower rates and for me to see them every week for several months."
1501,How can I afford to pay for a therapist AND a doctor's appointment AND medication?
1502,"I would only be getting $100 a week, which is like one session of therapy for the ones I could find in my area."
1503,"I see a therapist, have occasional anxiety attacks and was diagnosed with depression as a teenager, but I'll just never fully understand the level of what he lives with every day."
1504,"And if you're interested, I'm going to be using this medicine while I also work on the cognitive part and doing exposure therapy."
1505,I can't get into therapy for a while but that doesn't mean I can't try and be proactive.
1506,"I've read all about therapy and the countless success stories, long term results, etc."
1507,"I see the appeal of it, but I didn't want to go to a therapist, at least not yet."
1508,"Something that could just take the edge off, something that could allow me to experience the things that my inhibitions would otherwise not allow me to, and ideally - when I'm ready - go to a therapist for a more permanent solution."
1509,"I'm not looking for an easy way out of this, I just think that weeks of therapy is overkill."
1510,"He must have seen how anxious I felt because he gave me more Lorazepam, and recommended that I see a therapist."
1511,I booked a session for two days from now with the therapist.
1512,I think I might print this off and bring it to my first therapist session in two days.
1513,"Although I have improved quite a bit, there are still some days that I wonder if my anxiety will ever go away and if all of this therapy is useless."
1514,"Before anyone suggests, she can't seek therapy due to her health insurance situation in relation to her parents (they think it's a joke, that's she's fine, and yes, they're the source of basically all of this)."
1515,"I tried going to therapy, but the FIRST thing she asked me to do was make a ""timeline"" on a piece of paper of ""all the traumatic events that have happened in my life"" that might be the underlying cause."
1516,"I went to a second therapist that specialized in people who have been victims of abuse/ gone through some rough shit in their lives, and I found myself constantly lying to her."
1517,"After therapy, I went to my stereotypical general doctor to get a checkup."
1518,Other than go to a therapist/take drugs/ exercise/ take supplements and vitamins?
1519,I know this is not normal and I'm going to call my therapist tomorrow because this is something that I just can't do.
1520,I am starting therapy soon but more for BPD than anxiety.
1521,I have figured out through therapy that it is a coping mechanism for dealing with my Anxiety due to growing up in an abusive and dysfunctional atmosphere as a child.
1522,I was sat down with a PA who told me medication isn't the solution and that I need to be in group therapy 5 days a week 8 hours a day.
1523,She kept pressuring me to do the therapy but I told her I'd think about it just to get out of there and she wrote me a prescription for the same exact drugs that I was taking and am not happy with.
1524,I probably need to get in to see a therapist but I hate talking to people about my issues because I have this complex that I should be able to solve all of my problems myself.
1525,So after months of waiting I got a phone call last wednesday telling me there was a spot free at a medical centre for me to talk to a therapist about my anxiety issues.
1526,"We got talking about work and I found out she works as a secratery....

...at the place I'm going to get my therapy session..."
1527,But I don't want her to know I'm seeing a therapist (not this early in the relationship anyway).
1528,"I've been diagnosed with depression, but not anxiety as of yet, and I'm probably going to talk to my therapist when I see her this week, but I was just curious, has anyone else heard of such a thing?"
1529,I'm in therapy but it's so slow going because I can't be seen enough so it's kind of more trouble than it's worth.
1530,"Therapy didn't help, because I never got diagnosed, because I quit going before I could get diagnosed (I got diagnosed this January after seeing a new therapist)."
1531,"My therapist says it's actually good for me, because it's like a defense mechanism for my brain - more sleep = happy brain."
1532,About a year ago I started seeing a therapist but about maybe like five months after I stopped seeing him because the depression I was seeing him for seemed to be waning away.
1533,"Long story short: I'm 16, female, in my last year of HS
I don't feel like I'm making any progress after individual counselling, and now I'm in group therapy and I feel like an outsider and I'm really uncomfortable."
1534,"Over the years, thanks to therapy, I have found a few breathing exercises and distractions that help me mellow out when I get really overwhelmed (my go-to reaction is to read a book and try to relax), and was wondering if any of you have any techniques for when you need to pull yourself together."
1535,The healthcare in my city is atrocious so my therapy has been far and few between and they've all told me different things.
1536,"I believe I'm suffering from mild Agoraphobia and Bipolar disorder as well, although I have not been financially stable enough to go back to therapy since I was a teenager, So I may be wrong."
1537,The programs are basically healthy eating and work outs accompanied by lots of cognitive therapy exercises.
1538,"Click here to read more about the borderline personality disorder: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder

I go to therapy called Dialectical Behavorial Therapy."
1539,My specific therapy is called DBT (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy).
1540,"I've also tried other forms of therapy, specifically CBT (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy)

As far as proof goes I have the following:

The workbook we use for therapy: http://imgur.com/uio4g9M

And a piece of paperwork from one of my most recent hospitalizations: http://imgur.com/ZVv5KFJ (Note: this does not list my diagnoses, but I do not currently have any paperwork at my house that lists it, so I hope this is sufficient.)"
1541,Its part of exposure therapy and getting out my comfort zone.
1542,"I've been taking Zoloft for about a week, and have my first therapy session in a week."
1543,I do see a therapist every other week.
1544,"That, and I'm switching therapists soon."
1545,I'm getting EAP with this therapist and my dad told me I get free benefits and counseling through the VA since he's a Vietnam Vet.
1546,"It's a good thing, too, because my therapist said she wanted me to start doing two visits a week."
1547,I lost my job and insurance a month ago (I've only been using Ativan as needed and seeing my therapist once a month).
1548,My therapist isn't back in office till Tuesday- but I'm going to try and work out payments to go back to seeing him.
1549,"I first dealt with it by going to a therapist, which helped tremendously."
1550,"Unfortunately, I had to move and could not immediately find an affordable therapist at my new location."
1551,"I went to a therapist, who gave me some silly stretches and a brand of tea, but none of it helped."
1552,"While things aren't completely better and I am still going to go to a special therapy/camp thing, I am happy and fell confident in my life."
1553,"I also went to a therapist, and I felt the same way."
1554,I think I might just never properly get a therapist because it's too hard for me.
1555,I usually can't have these conversations without a panic attack but I prepared with my therapist.
1556,"I was in therapy for social and general anxiety which my immediate family is well aware of, but don't seem to comprehend that it isn't something you just get over, or equate to some inconsequential problem compared to whatever fucking problem they have."
1557,"But, perhaps spiritual healing might be best, like an intervention of Islamic Psychotherapy."
1558,"I've been reading up on exposure therapy, and it sounds great in theory."
1559,Until I started going to therapy I had never thought of this as me being anxious.
1560,"I know some use EDMR therapy and exposure therapy but if those don't work, what other options are there?"
1561,"I don't know what to do anymore, I am not smart enough to articulate myself well to a psychiatrist or therapist to make any progress :(...I'm so alone and pathetic it's starting to make me sick to my stomach that I continue on with life"
1562,"I'm on several meds, and am going to therapy regularly."
1563,"I already have a history of anxiety and depression and am working through it with the help of anti-depressants, exercise and therapy every two weeks, but during this time, I can’t concentrate on anything else but our relationship possibly failing."
1564,"What are good coping mechanisms that I’m not already doing (pills, exercise, therapy)?"
1565,I don't want to have to see a therapist or go on medication.
1566,In between these two panic attacks I finally started therapy.
1567,"I'm tired of just dealing with it- I have not sought better help for this problem because when I was younger, I brought it up with my therapist who told me that ""everybody had anxiety"" and didn't work on it with me."
1568,"(when I went veggie, this therapist also told me I would feel better if I had a steak.)"
1569,"I don't have insurance so I can't easily see a therapist right now, I just need to know I'm not the only one and maybe pick up some tips on how to mentally neutralize intrusive thoughts."
1570,I want to see a therapist but I don't know when I can and I don't know what to do in the meantime.
1571,"I went to a therapist, a psychiatrist... her face still freaks me out."
1572,"Right now my beloved lavender lemongrass candle is almost done, and I figured, instead of just replacing it, I would see what aromatherapy items have worked for you guys!"
1573,"About me: 20 year old guy, out of shape going to community college

Basically I have been in therapy for the past year for depression/social anxiety/general anxiety."
1574,His therapist also wanted to put him in the psychiatric ward at the hospital.
1575,"My therapist's suggestion was to ask myself ""Why do I feel this way?"""
1576,I've never looked up the symptoms of als because my therapist advised against it.
1577,"I also never saw a doctor about it, because my therapist suggested that if I have symptoms, I should delay going a little, to see if the symptoms get worse."
1578,"He's just going to get tired of how often I cry because I'm so anxious and my mood swings are so bad (my therapist thinks i might have Cyclothymia, we're looking into that) isn't he just going to want to leave me?"
1579,Been taking Prozac 20mg and seeing an anxiety therapist and things got better albeit manageable.
1580,I've been seeing a therapist for the last couple of months and we've been talking a lot about this issue.
1581,I've been thinking about maybe finding a new therapist that specialises on CBT.
1582,I see a psychiatrist and a therapist.
1583,"If it helps, I have been in therapy for the past 3 years."
1584,In college I started seeing a therapist.
1585,"I'm starting to get anxiety about having to drive, which is a problem because for me getting outside and doing things with friends is really great therapy for me and I can't do that as easily if I can't drive."
1586,"I noticed that it was progressively getting worse, so I decided that it was probably a good idea to go see a therapist."
1587,"Now, I've only been to therapy a couple times, but I have already been helped tremendously."
1588,The first is the top-down approach (most commonly used in cognitive therapy) which is essentially to learn to control your thoughts so that you can potentially control your physiological response to certain situations.
1589,The second way to minimize anxiety is through the bottom-up approach (commonly used in behavioral therapy).
1590,"If you are to combine the two approaches though (cognitive-behavioral therapy), the faults of each are suppressed."
1591,Final Note: Go to therapy.
1592,"Okay, so about a week ago I thought my therapist (who I've seen for about three months now) and I had finally started to get along quite well."
1593,"Well, I had another therapy session yesterday and it wasn't great (I had one on Monday this week as well and that wasn't great either)."
1594,I felt ok but anxious when I arrived but felt very frustrated and depressed when I left the therapist's office.
1595,"We (well, my therapist, I was quite passive) spent the session talking about what I can do to feel better."
1596,"But seriously, is this what therapy is supposed to be like?"
1597,It seems like people benefit from therapy so *is there some sort of important key to therapy that I'm missing?!
1598,I'm tired of feeling frustrated and I'm disappointed in the fact that I thought therapy was going better when it clearly isn't (but what do I know?
1599,I did go to a therapist for about 6 sessions because my mum thought it would be good for me but I'm very picky with who I'm comfortable talking to about personal stuff so I lied quite a lot to the therapist and claimed I was fixed when in reality I'm just a mess and hardly told them any of my issues.
1600,I should start by saying that I've only met the therapist twice so it might be too early for me to know what she's really like.
1601,"Also, it's my first time in therapy so maybe this is the way it works and maybe this is how a therapist is supposed to talk (which is why I'm asking you guys what you think)."
1602,While at the session today I just felt as if my therapist was talking to me as if I was a child or as if I was stupid (it was the same the week before as well though even worse this week).
1603,"Before starting therapy I was really looking forward to it (starting therapy that is) but now, after I've met her twice, I'm already starting to dread it."
1604,Are therapists supposed to make you feel like this?
1605,I want therapy to work.
1606,He also scheduled me to see a therapist in two weeks.
1607,"I spent about 9 months isolating myself from the world, trying to figure out how to manage my anxiety without meds or therapy."
1608,(No therapy because my anxiety is primarily social...
1609,"I plan to eventually begin therapy, just haven't felt ready to take that step and haven't had the finances.)"
1610,I have a therapist I see back home.
1611,So I started going to a therapist for my anxiety and in the first session he recommended I try a technique called 'paradoxical intention'.
1612,Is my therapist a nut job?
1613,My therapist even says I am too negative for him to help me unless I can pull myself out of it a bit.
1614,I have been through three other therapies which have all helped to varying degrees but this is the first time someone has mentioned this to me.
1615,With support from my therapist and the people on this most glorious subreddit I'm now at the stage where I know I can change.
1616,"I spent 3 years in complete isolation after my high school diploma because of a crippling bout of depression and social anxiety, only to find that in my country, they're now allowed to refuse me access to a higher education because of that 3 year gap where I did nothing (except, you know, therapy)."
1617,I take medication for my anxiety and I see a therapist but I still suffer from anxiety attacks :\
1618,"She is the reason I am seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, she is the reason I am alive sometimes I think."
1619,My therapist hasn't really had a chance to help me with it all as I have just started seeing a new one.
1620,My last therapist destroyed the trust I had built up with her (my friend).
1621,"I was forced into therapy, the wrong therapy."
1622,I left because my anxiety and I could not handle work (even after months of intensive therapy).
1623,"I've not been diagnosed, but I'm trying to find a therapist to talk about these things with, and maybe talk about medication or coping mechanisms."
1624,"I really really want to go to a mental hospital or maybe a therapist, but I feel like I'll be disappointing my friends and family."
1625,"Usually when I go talk to my therapist, specific triggers of anxiety are discussed and she helps me through dealing with those."
1626,"I have suggested therapy, which I would even PAY FOR if necessary because it makes me upset to see him in distress all the time, but he gets furious whenever I bring it up."
1627,I've told a little to my usual doctor and she suggested I find a therapist or something.
1628,"I take Cymbalta and after months of steady improvement with therapy and medication, I've tapered my dosage down to 20mg (lowest) where it will stay for a while."
1629,":)

---

There is still one anxiety issue which my therapist and I have yet to address and that is driving."
1630,"(And I will, of course, also deal with this issue with my therapist)."
1631,After confirming with the hospital that there was really nothing wrong with me (not having a heart attack) I have started therapy and wanted to get a doctor's prescription to refill my Xanax and perhaps go on a SSRI.
1632,"I am looking to schedule with a therapist next week, and have some reservations regarding taking the Zoloft I have been prescribed, but I was wondering what some people have used in the mean time to tone down the anxiety."
1633,How do I go to a therapist?
1634,"The finding a therapist thing doesn't show any near me, and there's no sliding scale clinics anywhere near me listed either."
1635,She has already suggested me to see a psychotherapist to get over the murder case.
1636,Would getting a therapist help?
1637,"I've experienced this sensation for as long as I can remember, but no therapist/counsellor I've seen has heard of it."
1638,"I don't have a therapist, I've never found anyone I liked and I don't trust them."
1639,"The therapy didn't really help (it may have just been my therapist), but I began taking medication to clear the fog."
1640,"In my previous rounds of therapy, I was never told blatantly that I have X. I'm starting my third round at a new place later today, and I really want to ask for one because I feel like it'd be comforting to be able to point and say ""that's what I have- my doctor told me."""
1641,"Even at the grocery store, my mom once told my therapist, I would be afraid of white powder… next to a bag of flour…."
1642,So my mom took me to a therapist who attributed my ADD to anxiety and put me on Celexa.
1643,"Finally, we got an appointment with a therapist."
1644,I started seeing the therapist twice a week and we talked about how these thoughts are a way for my body to tell me that something is wrong.
1645,"For years, I didn't want to talk to a therapist."
1646,"My first therapist meant well, but wasn't the right fit."
1647,"I still visit my therapist about once every 6 weeks or so, just to check in."
1648,"I don't want to take any medication, and it's difficult finding a therapist here in Japan."
1649,"I'm pretty much just telling a story because I have no one at all that I can tell this to, not my family, friends, I don't know if I even want to tell my therapist."
1650,I went through a lot of therapy to get over it.
1651,"I hate medication, and therapy does not do anything for me after trying it for a month."
1652,"Six years of therapy and a move away from home helped, but now I feel like I'm right back where I started."
1653,"http://sharedlife.tumblr.com/post/26222392129/anxiety

I tend to have difficulty expressing my feelings, so on my therapist's suggestion I wrote about my experiences with anxiety."
1654,She has gone to therapy in the past and has medications she takes daily.
1655,"I am monitored by a psychiatrist, and will be starting therapy sometime soon, hopefully."
1656,I would prefer not to see a therapist/take meds but looking at my own writing it appears I'm pretty fucked up.
1657,"I had always thought this was all the anxiety I had, and I went to a therapist about it (she was awful, not helpful) and I thought that was that."
1658,"** 

I plan on getting a therapist when I go back to school in 2 weeks."
1659,"I also don't have particularly great therapy experiences, so I'm not sure how well that will work for me."
1660,I've been in therapy for a couple of years straight and was in and out for years before that.
1661,"Aside from the usual fears of being on drugs that will turn me into a different person or make my suicidal tendencies worse, or the fear that therapy won't help, I've also been overwhelmed with the realization that I won't be able to safely drink alcohol while on most medications."
1662,"I live in toronto Ontario, if anyone can help me find a therapist that is affordable that would be amazing, and I would appreciate it greatly."
1663,"So, I called my therapist in Vermont and made some appointments and was able to visit my boyfriend during that time, and got everything (what I thought was) under control, and the fog went away."
1664,"I've made an appointment to talk on the phone with my therapist, but I was wondering if this still my anxiety (since I haven't experienced these types of feelings with it before) or if I'm actually going insane and starting to lose touch with reality, which is pretty much my biggest fear."
1665,She's firm in believing that therapy is a total waste of time and money.
1666,That therapy isn't a total quack.
1667,I've personally gone to therapy when I was a teenager for ADHD.
1668,"I am not making him my therapist or anything like that, but having him there to talk to helps so much."
1669,"Despite therapy and meds, keep getting worse...."
1670,"Years of therapy, self-help books, willpower, toughing it up... and at the end of it all, I just want to be dead."
1671,"(How cruel for an anxiety sufferer) I have my relaxation tapes on, and I am trying to remain positive that this will pass; but I am afraid of the next time it will happen, and disheartened that I will never get better, even with my therapy."
1672,"I have always been a very nervous/stressed out person, but within the last few years I've noticed things that make me seriously wonder if I could have an anxiety disorder so I wanted to ask people who are actually going through it before considering therapy or something."
1673,"Anyway, a few weeks ago I read somewhere that hypnotherapy is a very effective way of treating anxiety disorders so I thought ""Why the fuck not, I've got nothing to lose.""."
1674,I'm well aware this could come from codependency related to my mothers severe alcoholism but with all the therapy and medication I can't seem to change.
1675,"I should add that she's not the type to take medicine, go to counseling, therapy, or understand that she even has anxiety."
1676,Right now our marriage therapist is really pushing hard for me to take something (and I don't understand her behavior.)
1677,"I'm a very anxious (in therapy for it), insecure, quiet girl who is always concerned with what other people think."
1678,I don't see a therapist and I don't have any friends so I don't really have anyone to talk to about my anxiety issues.
1679,"I have been having terrible anxiety the past few months, and am seeing a therapist next week, as well as a normal doctor in April."
1680,So I started therapy for the first time in my life...
1681,I'm really excited but also a bit worried because there are countless of therapies and methods and I'm not sure what is right for me and I'm wondering which are other people's experiences with what I'm doing now.
1682,The therapist I'm seeing has been suggested by a friend.
1683,"I think it's some sort of cognitive behavioural therapy, but a bit different from what I'm reading online it should be (which is ok, everyone has a personal style I guess)."
1684,"I did one session, she said it was going to be focused on changing thoughts and behaviours (as CBT) and it was going to be a short term therapy (6 months - 1 year)."
1685,Does anybody else has experience of this kind of therapy?
1686,Do you know if this is CBT or something else (my therapist never said it was CBT)?
1687,"I value every opinion, I have a positive opinion of this first session but I'm trying to understand more about my options before committing with this therapist."
1688,"Anyway, time to start seeing a therapist again?"
1689,I've been going to a talk therapist and have also gotten a prescription to Zoloft and Xanax from my general practitioner.
1690,I'm currently in therapy for anxiety and depression and take Zoloft for both but lately I have been feeling extremely tired.
1691,I mentioned my tiredness to my therapist and she asked if I was feeling really depressed lately to which I couldn't really give an answer.
1692,"The doctor and therapist both told me that this medication had minimal side effects, no weight gain, and withdrawal was easy."
1693,I'm not big on taking medications but I figured I would start the Zoloft and use Xanax as needed until my therapy sessions start.
1694,"I've done a lot of research, and aside from seeing all the problems with 1) her therapy and approaches to her anxiety/making progress, and 2) my efforts in dealing with it and relating to her, I have some general ideas about better addressing and caring for someone with anxiety."
1695,"Either in therapy, medication, approaches...etc?"
1696,"So in my 6th visit to therapy yesterday, my therapist and I kind of got to the core of my thought process."
1697,My therapist is Icelandic and there is a bit of a language barrier in understanding him.
1698,My therapist tells me that I should not look at it that way.
1699,I've been looking into hypnotherapy for my anxiety/agoraphobia since no medication seems to be helping nor does CBT.
1700,I have sought help here in the form EDMR therapy but it didn't go well and so this phobia is still around.
1701,"After I was off the drug, I decided that I wanted to try therapy."
1702,"I know I need to see a therapist, and I plan on it, but it has to wait until September."
1703,"Is there any hope for fixing myself naturally with just exercise, those things, and a therapist?"
1704,My brain was almost completely locked up no matter how much I tried to do relaxation exercises or cognitive therapy techniques.
1705,I started seeing a therapist after a particularly bad night from when I had lived alone previously over a year ago.
1706,"I've tried medication, I've tried therapy, I've tried breathing and telling myself it's gonna be okay."
1707,I am 20 years old and have had social anxiety my whole life and even though its gotten better with medication and therapy it still holds me back in many regards.
1708,I have seen two therapists in the past and while both were very nice none helped.
1709,I went to see a therapist about how to cope with stress while at work; instead what he gave me was a set of mental tools to understand my issues from a completely different perspective.
1710,He started an aggressive chemotherapy routine that destroyed his body.
1711,"I'm not asking anyone for a diagnosis: I just got a therapist, and I plan to talk it over with them."
1712,I've been seeing my therapist for a few months.
1713,"She kept saying what ""normal people with anxiety do"" and what they expect a person to do for treatment and how three weeks doesn't seem right, ""normal anxiety sufferers have an attack, get medicated, see a therapist and are back working within a week."""
1714,"I don't want to go spend more money I don't have at a therapist to get guided through relaxation, I just want to be left alone."
1715,"I don't have any real support, I can't afford therapy at the moment."
1716,"My therapist said not to separate myself from other people like that, but I really feel like I work and think differently than what school and parents have been pressuring me to be like."
1717,I finally went to see a therapist about anxiety and depression because it is starting to get out of control.
1718,The problem is I am having a really hard time getting myself to schedule the next appointment and sign up for group therapy as was suggested.
1719,I don't know whether to share this with my therapist or not.
1720,"And he has the nerve to tell me I need more therapy, and that when I was IN therapy (at his request) a few months ago that I wasn't talking about the right things."
1721,"During the school year I attended therapy with a private professional,and was prescribed medication that I had to take at school instead of home because of my parents."
1722,"But then the school year ended-and with it,the therapy sessions and medication intakes."
1723,My therapist has relocated and I do not have her number.
1724,"I've tried therapy, self-help books, medications and just plain ol' doing it on my own."
1725,I'm seeing both a doctor and a therapist about these things but it doesn't seem to be helping.
1726,"I'm seeing a psychiatrist/therapist for generalized anxiety disorder (with a definite lean towards social anxiety) and certainly getting better, but this situation is still weighing heavily on me so I thought I'd see if anyone here has some suggestions or advice."
1727,"Therapy is nice, but I have done so much research on anxiety and CBT techniques that I don't feel like my therapist is really adding anything to my treatment at the moment."
1728,I've never had a therapy and live a totally normal life apart from continuing job problems.
1729,I keep forgetting to call my therapist to resume visits and talk about the possibility of medication.
1730,"I'm starting to feel really out of control, my life is revolving around my anxiety, and I want to seek therapy."
1731,Do any of you have tips on how to find a therapist that is a good fit and convey my intentions to my parents?
1732,"I visited two docs and everybody told me that my heart is OK and they did not know were the pain came from, the third doc send me to the physiotherapist and he helped me."
1733,"I have been in therapy before, but I can no longer find a good therapist that I can afford since I am no longer a student."
1734,I've reached out to TWO local therapists today to see if I can talk with someone.
1735,I don't have a therapist and I don't need one.
1736,"I need to go to therapy before I can go to any classes, but I missed one appointment due to a cold and the fee is $150."
1737,I spent the next nine months in various forms of therapy.
1738,I am currently seeing a therapist twice a week and a psychiatric nurse practitioner once a month.
1739,I worry an awful lot that my psychologist will forget to refer me to a therapist.
1740,I saw the psychologist on Friday last week and she said she'd email or call me when she's referred me or when she's referred me and the therapist has confirmed he's gotten the referral (don't remember which one).
1741,I have done all kinds of therapy for years and tried a number of different medications.
1742,I have my first appointment with a therapist tomorrow.
1743,I'm sick of going to therapists I haven't found one that really gets down and helps me.
1744,"Hi all,

I am in the process of trying to find a new therapist."
1745,I have been using therapists in network for a while now with no great healing.
1746,I'm probably going to talk with a therapist in the next few days.
1747,There were no counsellors or therapists to talk to me and my other siblings (I was the oldest) about what was happening.
1748,"Literally, the only reason I find out is because we're in couples therapy and our counselor has him revisit/discuss situations while I'm there."
1749,"(if any other clarification of our situation is needed, feel free to ask in comments)  


EDIT: he did tell me he had ""anxiety issues"" early in our relationship, but the full scale of it didn't come out until we were in therapy."
1750,"I started seeing a therapist, which was extremely helpful."
1751,I just wanted to post to tell others to not be afraid to take that step towards therapy/meds.
1752,"I know therapy is key in overcoming anxiety, but I am just wondering if anyone has successfully (or unsuccessfully) tried any other forms of 'healing'."
1753,We don't have the money for therapy or expensive treatments.
1754,"I am in the process of thinking about therapy as well (I have been before), but in the meantime I feel like I need something to tie me over."
1755,"I went and spoke with a therapist about it for the first time last week, finally deciding I need help."
1756,"She then said I could be put on the wait list for actual therapy session, which would take about 2 months."
1757,"The therapist I spoke with recommended I go to a doctor and have a mental health assessment done, which is also a scary thought."
1758,We start hypnotherapy next week so I'm hoping that'll help with the server anxiety I'm going through.
1759,"My therapist, who I've just started seeing for GAD, has given me audio recordings for mindfulness exercises."
1760,"I've heard massage therapy might help...that'd be an expensive option for me (poor college student), but if it really works well I'd give it a try."
1761,Edit: Every week when I see my therapist she asks me if I'm still against the idea of medication.
1762,"My doctor says she is totally fine with just doing therapy and such until I feel as though I've exhausted all my options so I don't feel pressured to take anything, really, but I just didn't know how many people had experience with them."
1763,"I'm not looking for a cure but I mostly want to have a discussion to maybe see where this anxiety is from and discuss it with my therapist (been to doctor, I'm only 21, he ruled out physical issues)."
1764,"I've been on medication before and it was not a good time, and I've been in and out of therapy since I was 13 (19 now)."
1765,"I won't go into the reasons or my findings in therapy, but I am finding myself back at the bottom of the well with my anxiety again."
1766,"because of all this, all of it wrapped up into huge balls of goop- I need to go to a therapist on top of going to the doctor."
1767,"So I have to go to the doctor to get a fast-acting anti anxiety pill, so I can then return to the doctor the next week after having taken it, and get my blood taken so I can be put on ANOTHER type of medication, so I can have the gall to go see a therapist."
1768,"Today, I finally made an appointment with a therapist."
1769,"I know I should go to therapy, but therapy just made me so much worse."
1770,"I was fine the first 2 or 3 times I saw a therapist, I mean not fine, but it was bearable."
1771,"Is there another form of therapy, or another way to get some help?"
1772,Just recently I've had a big fear of developing psychosis or schizophrenia up until an appointment with my therapist last week in which she informed me that I didn't have either of those things.
1773,I'm a college kid and recently started therapy at school for anxiety and depression because it's having a major impact on my social and academic life.
1774,Is it a structured program that you go through or is it more a style of therapy that your therapist will draw from?
1775,"I'm just wondering if CBT is more a general approach to therapy (which then largely depends on how your therapist interacts with you) or if its more structured and follows a set of lessons, exercises, homework...etc."
1776,"I've had this problem for a while, and I've seen a therapist before."
1777,After a half year of therapy I felt better and went to school again.
1778,"After that I got back in therapy..I faced my fear for the last 1,5 years."
1779,"When our insurance kicks in, we want to seek therapy, but other than that, i am at a loss."
1780,"Long story short: I got superb therapy, and Cipralex which I am still taking."
1781,I've seen a few different therapists and psychiatrists over the years but right now I don't have a regular person that I see.
1782,Everyone around me pushes me to go talk to a therapist but quite honestly I just have no time with Finals and other school organization work that I have to do.
1783,While working on a workshop on exposure therapies for anxiety (that I'm delivering Friday!)
1784,I am beginning the process of researching to find a therapist or some kind of 'life coach'.
1785,or some other kind of therapist?
1786,One of my friends wants me to get a therapist or see a doctor once we get there to help me.
1787,My symptoms are under control after years of therapy and medication.
1788,I am supposed to see my therapist next week and see a psychiatrist soon but for right now I don't know what to do.
1789,"I took my therapist's advice and starting saying things when I wanted (sorry if that's unclear), and it has made me feel better."
1790,"Growing up I had severe emtophobia and have been in therapy for anxiety, but I feel like I obsess over my health too much."
1791,"I'm looking for anxiety treatment, I go to therapy."
1792,"I'm more aware of what's going on now, and I've been seeking therapy for the last while."
1793,I already started seeing a therapist and taking paxil (which is making me sick to my stomach).
1794,That's alright tho I've been making good progress with therapy.
1795,"I haven't been able to afford therapy/a psychiatrist in about 6 years, and am well aware at this point I definitely need to start looking into more options."
1796,I'm in a one car situation with my supportive awesome boyfriend who needs it for his 9-5 job (I work from home) so being able to see a therapist or whatever would be a challenge.
1797,"I am trying to find other people that has experience of trying out this specific form of therapy for anxiety related problems, particularly social anxiety."
1798,I am planning on seeing a therapist and I really have no idea what I will talk to them about.
1799,"(sorry if this is a long post)I have been diagnosed with social anxiety and deep depression I ""went"" to my local therapy center which is centerstone and after talking to my therapist he sent me to the centers doctor he gave me escitalopram to treat my issues and it worked from time to time but here is my problem if i stop taking these I feel like i'm getting zapped and I start i get panic attacks so i started to take them again."
1800,"3 months later they rescheduled my appointment and did not tell me I called after my refill was denied they said i was removed from the system entirely because i missed too many appointments I was mad so i asked how can i get my medicine back i need them to live my life almost normal she said i have to start from scratch go through therapy again then i might have a chance to to see the doctor which could take half a year or more so here i am gone 2 weeks without my medicine i'm scared, depressed and there is nothing i can do."
1801,I have let my doctor and therapist know and I have been diagnosed with intrusive thoughts and there is no risk of suicide for me.
1802,I know this is a problem but i have to wait until open enrollment until i can get a new therapist.
1803,I feel like they could really help me combined with my CBT therapy.
1804,The first time they stopped as soon as I started seeing a therapist.
1805,The second time it took a therapist and a bit of medication.
1806,I started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist and got back on medication.
1807,I started seeing my therapist again.
1808,How have you guys felt during your first appointment with a therapist or psychiatrist?
1809,"With therapy, I've steadily been improving but am facing my biggest fear in 3 days - flying."
1810,"I also spoke to doctors about Electroconvulsive therapy (*ECT*), but never ended up trying it."
1811,"I tried talking therapists, which did help of course but not much."
1812,What other effects could healthcare covered therapy have?
1813,"Do any of you have advice about medication, or therapies for General anxiety?"
1814,"My insurance would only cover 80% of therapy, but I'm in college right now and would not be able to afford the other 20%."
1815,"I really did think I'd be able to step into my first day of therapy in over 5 years and say, ""I used to have these problems, but they've gotten much better as I've tried these techniques."
1816,"In the last 4 years or so, they've gotten especially bad and I've sunken into the rut of what my new therapist calls ""catastrophic thinking,"" where I think everything will go wrong or be embarrassing, and that it'll be my fault."
1817,"I've tried doctor after doctor after therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists."
1818,"I've gone to therapy in the past, and am scheduled to start going again soon."
1819,"I have medical records from at least 15 different therapists and psychiatrists, in addition to records from several psychiatric hospitalizations for mental health problems."
1820,"I do not mean for us to act like therapist to each other, but I know sometimes I am almost physically pulling my hair out because I feel there is something I need to say."
1821,I have an appt with my therapist on Thursday and I emailed her today to confirm the aoot and to let her know about todays developments.
1822,I had my first  therapy appointment (well not my *first* but my first in a few years) yesterday.
1823,Do I try to find a therapist who specialises in social anxiety?
1824,Are there therapists who do both?
1825,"But the bigger question is, how do I go about finding a therapist at all, let alone one who can actually help my problems?"
1826,"I've done searches on google and I've found therapists who, say, deal with anxiety but nothing specifically about social anxiety."
1827,"I really don't want to waste my time or money (I only work a shitty, barely about minimum wage job where I only get about 30 hrs a week if I'm lucky; money is tight) on a therapist who simply can't help me."
1828,"Nevertheless, my biggest hurdle is overcoming my anxiety just enough to actually make the initial contact with a therapist to get this ball rolling."
1829,"I've tried contacting one therapist so far via email and the lady responded by calling me, which really put me off and made me think that she doesn't really know social anxiety (I can't be the only one who strongly prefers email communication over voice.... difficulties on the phone is a common issue with severe social anxiety, isn't it?)."
1830,"If finding a therapist wasn't hard enough for me already, the last thing I want to do is to ask my asshole, tactless boss to change my schedule to visit a *therapist*."
1831,I haven't started the offered therapy yet though due to horrendously busy university commitments.
1832,And did the therapy I was offered help you?
1833,"I'm afraid I will have to start seeing my therapist weekly again, and that my employer won't want to work around that."
1834,Almost 4 years of therapy down the drain and now it's worse.
1835,"I see my therapist today to get her opinion on it and discuss my feelings, so I can hopefully let you know what she says."
1836,"If I wanted to seek cognitive behavioral therapy, are there options available to people like me, with tight wallets?"
1837,"&gt;:(

I've been seeing a therapist for a few months (English-speaking, thank goodness), but I'm still just as lost, unemployed and miserable as I was before."
1838,"I feel as though ACT, CBT and mindfulness therapies work to an extent when it comes to separating YOU from your MIND."
1839,I don't see my therapist again until the 17th.
1840,"I have a psychiatrist right now, but the medicine I'm taking only does so much for me and I think it would do me good to have someone to talk to, like a therapist."
1841,"I am already in therapy, but I have so many problems that it's just going very slow and I feel like I'm going to run out of time and miss the success-boat sooner or later."
1842,"I decided to contact the psychology department at Emory University in Atlanta, and I start therapy sessions next week."
1843,I already do CBT therapy and meditate.
1844,"I got really nervous, I feel very exposed on the community as you can not be anonymous (like you can be on reddit) however my therapist really wanted me to make an account and now i feel horrible that i can't really enjoy the site.. i feel like i failed even more :(

*edit i deleted my account.. i am going to stick with the reddit support groups and such, only problem is.. i use this account for everything and i am worried about people stalking my account and such, i mean nobody i know irl knows my username.. but still."
1845,I am in therapy and on celexa.
1846,Both my therapist and doctor know.
1847,Have tried therapy for years but just breathing isn't helping much.
1848,I've seen an on campus therapist for the past couple months but as the time gets closer to graduation I feel myself almost suffocating and drowning.
1849,"I have anxiety, and I've been going to therapy for the last couple years, but this feels totally different."
1850,"After attending cognitive behavioural therapy, I realised that a lot of my anxiety stems from my father."
1851,I finally made the step to go see a therapist for my anxiety and to find out if I have ADHD or not.
1852,"I can’t afford therapy as I don’t have insurance, and I’m not looking to take medication because I don’t want to become dependent and I’d like to be able to control it myself."
1853,My therapist and I have had chats about this.
1854,I've been seeing a therapist but I'm not too fond of him.
1855,I've honestly had over a half dozen therapists without much success.
1856,Starting to lose faith in therapy's potential for me.
1857,There is one more therapist that was recommended to me but I have yet to call him for an appointment.
1858,Started seeing a therapist and started taking Lexapro.
1859,I don't have health insurance so I can't get therapy.
1860,I am on medication for this and it has helped and ive gone through years of therapy and stopped because it really didnt help.
1861,It wasn't until I got my anxiety under control with therapy and medication (of which I'm now off) that I lost that happy feeling.
1862,I've been to a therapist twice because I've been struggling more than I thought I would in school.
1863,I'm currently in therapy and have realized that I do not love myself for who I am.
1864,"I see a therapist (met with her today, in fact), but my anxiety is truly getting the best of me these days and I don't know what to do."
1865,"I haven't seen my doctor or therapist in this time, and today me and my mom just got a letter from my therapists office saying ""Since you haven't kept contact, we assume our services are no longer needed."
1866,I have no faith in medication or therapy anymore because I feel like i've tried it all.
1867,•Public speaking…oh my… Probably worth saying now that I have verbal dyspraxia and had years of speech therapy.
1868,"It wasn't until recently that I was made aware by my therapist that the feeling of anxiety has been scientifically proved to only last a maximum of 45 minutes when faced with a real life or death situation, i.e a grizzly bear attacking you, before noradrenaline is produced to calm you down."
1869,"So I've been pretty put off of seeking professional help unless someone is willing to PM me and lives in the Northern Virginia area to give me a personal recommendation to a doctor, therapist, or social worker who will hear me out."
1870,"I've tried a million things to get rid of my anxiety: doctors, therapist, supplements, running, improved posture, you name it I've probably tried it except for medication because I'm scared to death of them."
1871,"I don't have access to a therapist, except through my family, which isn't supportive of help for mental illness."
1872,I've tried therapy and absolutely hated it every time but I do have an appointment with a new therapist the week after next.
1873,"I think there are different problems, but I've faced and talked about each one to my therapist."
1874,Ever since I've started going to therapy my anxiety has just gotten worse and worse.
1875,As a child i was diagnosed with everything from ADHD to OCD to Major Depressive / Bi-Polar disorders by a child therapist.
1876,Because my child therapist only kept paper records and they've never been transferred when I moved there's only a single remark in my file about my anxiety issues from my last family doctor making note that I was being 'treated' by the therapist in question.
1877,I've had a panic disorder for 8 years now and have been through therapy and meds and being housebound and being fine.
1878,"I am at the point where I know I need a therapist, but not sure how to go about finding one."
1879,I'm currently in therapy for my astraphobia (fear of thunder &amp; lightning) which is pretty severe.
1880,"I'm fine if there are balloons in the room and I will not go out of my way to avoid them - suggesting it isn't a 'phobia' per se - but during my last session, when my therapist brought out balloons of varying sizes to pop I would freak out as soon as the pushpin he was using to pop was an inch away from the balloon."
1881,"I realized I actually needed help like three or four months ago and began speaking with a therapist, but it's done nothing so far."
1882,"I decided to go to therapy, I though ""oh maybe its mental illness, once I take care of that I cant finally be happy, calm""."
1883,"SO I went to therapy, and felt a little better, i learned little things that I forget all the time, little tricks to manage my feelings, but it was short lived."
1884,Talk to a therapist?
1885,It consisted mainly of several hours of group therapy each day.
1886,"(I'm in therapy now, but I've quit numbing myself so much but haven't gotten all the coping mechanisms down yet, so I'm kind of in a raw spot.)"
1887,"I work 8 hours a day, except for the days I'm at school (Tuesday and Thursday) and Monday when I have therapy every other week."
1888,"She's also been using ""retail"" therapy to make herself better."
1889,She is not mature/proactive enough to refill her prescriptions and she refuses to go to therapy.
1890,"She refuses to accept help, routinely take medicine, or go to a therapist."
1891,"I'm in the UK and I'm on disability, so I don't have the money to have the luxury of choosing a therapist, I just have to take what the NHS gives me."
1892,The CBT therapist spent about 20 sessions just talking about what we were *going* to be doing.
1893,"Tried seeing a therapist from school who can only pen me in twice a month which really sucks because I have no friends where I live(SF and all my close friends and family are in LA), not to mention I have practically no family only immediate family members because the rest of them on my moms end are drunkard selfish bums who don't even love themselves and on my dads end religious nuts who criticize you and judge every waking moment of your life as soon as you look away."
1894,The last time I went to the therapist I ended up calling my mom and exploding on her for defending him and I ended up sobbing and crying to her my friends and my sister about how bad I felt about making my mother cry about her beliefs.
1895,My therapist today assessed me for anxiety and depression and I scored pretty severe in both areas.
1896,"Moving along a year, I'm in therapy and it's going good."
1897,I see a therapist every other week.
1898,"It'll be one year of seeing my main therapist (who determined that I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder)
My main therapist thinks I would benefit a lot from daily anxiety meds and suggested me seeing a psychiatrist."
1899,"Sure enough, within weeks of returning to uni, my parent was diagnosed, and sent for surgery, in the hope that they could remove the tissue and not need to enrol her for chemotherapy."
1900,Someone gave me this [link](http://nacbt.org/searchfortherapists.asp http://www.abct.org/Members/?m=FindTherapist&amp;fa=FT_Form&amp;nolm=1) about a month ago and I couldn't find anyone in my county.
1901,I want to be able to afford to go see more than one therapist because i'm terrified that I'll be stuck with one shitty one.
1902,I met my partner towards the end of that period (summer 2012)... At that point I was still depressed (and in a group therapy group) but on my way to being better and I'd say I haven't been depressed since early in our relationship (a year and a half ago...
1903,"As the title says, I haven't been to a therapist in years and now I need one more than ever."
1904,"I've been seeing a psychiatrist, and therapist since my diagnosis."
1905,My anxiety is at an all time high and I am going to therapy every week now.
1906,So this is-- or was-- my second attempt at getting into therapy.
1907,"Then I finally got the call back, she took down my information and told me that she would match me to a therapist and call back ""probably Thursday or Friday."""
1908,I was told I was being matched to a therapist.
1909,"I went to my first ""session"" yesterday and was told that the only therapy they have is in groups..."
1910,Does anyone have any experience with group therapy who can give me a general idea of how it works?
1911,"I've gone to the psychiatrist, psychologists and group therapies and have learned every ""coping mechanism"" they have given me, but nothing has helped."
1912,"Even my therapist is starting to say ""just go out and be social"" when I know it isn't that simple."
1913,"I'm currently in therapy, but it isn't really helping with the panic attacks and nightmares that I now have."
1914,The next 6 - 7 months consisted of medication and therapy.
1915,I've tried seeing a therapist but it didn't not really help.
1916,I know that every therapist has their own style and sometimes some are better then others.
1917,But right now I don't really have time for therapy and I'm looking for a good book that could help me.
1918,So I haven't been to the therapist in months.
1919,I also have an appointment to go back in a few weeks to talk about talking therapies.
1920,"I started to see a therapist, got some help, and started to learn how to deal with them."
1921,"And to the hospital I went, off to the ER and eventually to the mental hospital where I spent a few days being pumped full of antidepressants and sleeping pills, going to group therapy and being monitored before I was released, immediately to be visited at home and then enrolled in a ""Crisis Diversion"" team who would come to my house once a week and talk to me."
1922,"Two of them were people I actually worked out deals with to come to my house for therapy, both of whom quit because they said they couldn't help me."
1923,I can't get actual therapist until I go back home for summer break (april end).
1924,"So, I know I should go to a therapist and do CBT but at the moment, that's not possible for me, for economic reasons."
1925,"Hi all,
I recently started taking prozac (I am on day 11, just upped my dosage as per the doc's orders) for mainly anxiety but also depression after discussing it with my therapist."
1926,"I'm definitely going to tell my therapist how I'm feeling, but I'm afraid they're just going to tell me to wait it out because thats when they said last time."
1927,I'm currently seeing a therapist to try to figure out my underlying issues.
1928,I am looking for a therapist/psychologist to help treat and monitor my anxiety and depression.
1929,"I tried seeing a therapist about a year ago to talk through separate anxiety issues, but I found it completely useless during the several visits I had."
1930,"I started seeing a therapist and am going back on medication, which quells my panic and fear pretty damn well, when i'm on it."
1931,"I am in psychoanalysis four days a week, but my therapist has been on vacation for the holidays and I won't see her until Thursday, and I genuinely feel like I'm losing my mind."
1932,"Again, I'll see my therapist on Thursday, but I honestly feel like I'm going crazy, and I feel helpless and like I can't handle it any longer."
1933,The only time I go outside is when I go to my girlfriends house or when I go to my therapist.
1934,I really don't even like to go to my therapist because I'm to scared that she will make fun of me or something.
1935,I've been receiving regular therapy for my phobia for over a year now and am seeing no signs of improvement.
1936,So I decided to get a therapist.
1937,Today I had a break through with my therapist and realized I am suffering depression and anxiety as an adult because as a child all I faced was disappointment.
1938,"My life has improved since currently i'm employed, going to school and decided to attend therapy, but that little girl that has been wanting to cry out why no one was willing to defend her and make her feel that she is a worthy human being is finally coming out."
1939,"I've been variously diagnosed as depressed, bipolar, severe anxiety, paranoia....every shrink has a different idea, different therapy, different drugs, none work."
1940,"Also will I  have to go to a therapist if I decide to try medication, I've been to 2 before and didn't find it helpful?"
1941,I don't know how to handle this and I'm not currently seeing a therapist.
1942,I'm going to start proper therapy and I am really hoping I can somehow overcome this.
1943,"I definitely appreciate it, and will soon be sheduling an appointment with a therapist."
1944,"He told me that he thought I had social anxiety (in fact he said it seemed so obvious from such a young age that he might call it a crime that it was not dealt with in elementary school), and that the ADD and insomnia might be separate, but could be caused by anxiety so he wanted to do therapy to improve it over time."
1945,I'm feeling good about therapy.
1946,"Unfortunately I'm kind of nervous because therapy hasn't helped in the past, but I'm hoping things go better this time."
1947,I haven't seen a therapist for..whatever it is I have.
1948,I don't even know if going to a therapist will help because I'm at the point to where I don't even know if I'm worrying about a specific thing or just feeling anxiety all the time.
1949,Then I started seeing a therapist.
1950,"Not that it was an earth-shattering love or anything, but in combination with therapy it was what I needed to really have hope for my life."
1951,I had a quite upsetting therapy session yesterday where I got to know I won’t get to see my psychologist for at least a couple of months.
1952,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the place for this, but my fiance has just started therapy and medication for Generalized Anxiety Disorder."
1953,"When anxiety came into the mix a few years ago, I started seeing therapist and psychiatrists, and tried all sorts of meds."
1954,"After spending a week in the hospital for attempted suicide, I took advantage of my school's mental health services (got set up with a new psychiatrist, a new therapist, and registered with Disability Services)."
1955,"I have begun therapy and have also begun going to church and accepting God (I know that this doesn't work for everyone, but for me it has been a great help so please, no judgement)."
1956,"* I've always had severe anxiety problems
* It was so bad that I couldn't get my infected severely infected toenails removed  because my parents used to get my toenails removed under local anesthetic (a big assed needle in your toe) since I was 1
* I have PTSD when it comes to doctors because of this
* Can only find help from pill pushing doctors for anxiety
* End up with a bunch of chemical dependancies
* End up having nervous breakdown because of the sideffects from the drugs
* Get stuck in hospitals and anxiety and trauma anxiety build up even more
* Get abused emotionally a lot by bad workers there and mentally ill people 

* get out
* Get diagnosd with aspergers and get proper therapy for my sensory integration problems (sensitive to noise, this is important)
* Pill pushing doctors use it as an excuse to push pills of course
* things are OK for a few years
* I get assaulted and lose all my friends and become agoraphobic
* Parents send  me BACK to the hospital
* PTSD is so bad I can't return home
* Get sent to group home where I was in danger of being killed, had to witness a guy cut himself becuase he was trolling us, screamed at everyday
* Finally got ot move when literally everyone I lived with was assaulted by the previous guy weilding a blunt object because it wasn't safe for me there."
1957,"* had to live next to a titless cancer survivor who used it as an excuse to get high and drunk and party every day
* move a second time
* forced to live with home care support workers because of the shitty BMS who put me in the traumatic group home in the first place
* BMS leaves because she's shit but I keep working with the home care workers

**VERY relavent to the topic title and what I'm going through right  right here:**

* I was seeing a therapist since the group home about it all but she turns out to be shit and leaves because I wanted to go to the Doctor before I went back to school."
1958,In the past ive had lots of problems with anxiety and have talked to my university therapists.
1959,I've gone down the therapy path a few times but I don't think I was really ready to accept it.
1960,"So much so now that my therapist tells me that eating has become triggering for me :^(

She told me to distract myself while eating, by watching my favorite show or reading or something and every time I do and am even just vaguely successful I start to worry about not feeling sick and I end up making myself sick from worrying about not being sick."
1961,"“Consequently, clinicians could employ new treatment models for social anxiety or similar types of distress administering MDMA on one to several occasions within the context of a supportive and integrative psychotherapy protocol.”
MDMA is also being looked at to treat other psychiatric conditions."
1962,"For example, a 2010 study found administering MDMA during psychotherapy alleviated symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), compared to 25% who had therapy alone."
1963,"Rising in popularity in the the late 1970s and early 1980s among a circle of underground chemists, therapists and psychedelic drug enthusiasts, it later became infamous as the drug that fuelled all-night raves."
1964,"For anyone who doesn't know what this is: http://psychcentral.com/lib/an-overview-of-dialectical-behavior-therapy/0001096)

Tonight, however, I am feeling extremely mixed and troubles about a series of events that took place and I don't know where to place my energy."
1965,"I am also seeing therapist and, after years of working together, starting CBT."
1966,"Thank you if you made it this far.... thank you...

**Edit: I go to therapy (with a Psychiatrist that I am quickly beginning to think is useless) and I have seen many different counselors for years (probably since I was 16 so on and off for 13 years) and I take medication."
1967,"Needless to say it's all psychosematic bullshit medicine, right up there with the people in CA doing ""light therapy"" or whatever the newest unproven bullshit new age medicine is.....

Long story short, I'm out on Short Term Disability for losing it at work."
1968,"I have been struggling with GAD for most my life now and it's gotten better with therapy and medications but sometimes I get almost ""flair ups"" of anxiety."
1969,"I've recently been dealing with a lot of anxiety, and while there are many different ways of dealing with it, medication, meditation, therapy, or the million other things you can do, I have found a really easy way to take about 1% of the edge off, and I'm sure a lot of people do it."
1970,"If you're able to even discuss your findings with someone, whether it be a trusted friend or family member, or a therapist, it could be useful information!"
1971,I am on medication now and regular therapy.
1972,"I need to get out of the house more often, yes I know you probably live miles away, but I'm just looking for someone who can motivate me, and is willing to start exposure therapy

cheers
Im 25/m/ Canada"
1973,"My doctor prescribes me ativan, he really insisted on SSRIs at first but I never took them and now he lets me have the ativan as long as I continue therapy."
1974,I have this book called People Skills my therapist suggested but I have a hard time actually applying it.
1975,"I plan on seeing and talking to my therapist about this, but I'm not sure when I'll be able to see her."
1976,I take medication for these and see a therapist.
1977,I am now 22 and having undergone therapy quite recently my issues are widely under control.
1978,"Anyway, there was a professor on there who talked about this online therapy, titled 'This Way Up.'"
1979,"She was very open and understanding, even when I started talking about how ""over"" being in therapy I am."
1980,"My issue now is all of the stressful, anxiety-provoking things I need to accomplish before I can even start the process of finding a therapist that works for me."
1981,No matter how much couple therapy it wasn't working.
1982,A friend of mine brought me to his therapist and I had one session with her.
1983,"I told her ""I really don't like this job, I'm moving on, I don't have anything else but I have been seeing a therapist and have anxiety."
1984,I currently do not have insurance and cannot afford a therapist otherwise I would go see one.
1985,"I've been in therapy for years for depression and anxiety and substance abuse, but this issue is very pervasive."
1986,"I know that the common advice for anxiety is therapy and medication, but I'm far too anxious for the former and strongly dislike the latter."
1987,"I write a anxiety diary, suggested by my therapist where I document my panic attacks and feelings."
1988,Due to some of these things his therapist diagnosed him with PTSD.
1989,His therapist suggested that he revisit some of the people and places involved in some of the more traumatic events of his life.
1990,I talked with my therapist and she said if I don't want to go down the medication route I'd have to have long term therapy which I don't mind.
1991,"I keep putting off going to a therapist because I'm nervous about going, I don't know if it'd even help, and when do muster up the desire to go, I always feel like its unnecessary."
1992,"Finally, I've totally bailed on my therapist because he annoyed me and I didn't know how to tell him."
1993,"Today, our family friend therapist came to my house to speak to me about things and try out a bit of hypnotherapy as this has helped me in the past."
1994,"I've never tried any other prescribed medication, I've always just worked with therapists/over the counter medications like Rescue Remedy and Kalms."
1995,I went to a respected therapist many times and he says he sees no signs of anything serious.
1996,It's a 15-20 minute long survey pertaining to your experience in therapy.
1997,Please share this with others you know who have attended or currently attend therapy - it would be much appreciated!
1998,"I have been linked in with various college services like counselling, occupational therapy, and hopefully will see a psychiatrist soon and have been trying to negotiate extensions and accommodations, all the while unsure of how or if I can turn this ship around."
1999,I cannot afford go to therapy or get medication because I do not have health insurance and  cannot take advantage of any government assistance programs because of my income level.
2000,That + my parents and others not giving me attention as a child made me think that no one really was interested in me and I had to raise myself basically (this is something me and my therapist agreed upon).
2001,So I haven't seen my therapist in over six months (my mother stopped taking me after the possibility of medicating my anxiety came up during my therapy sessions).
2002,"I mean, I know everyone is different, but would you say it's worth it or should I just tough it out until I can see a therapist in a few weeks?"
2003,I am also in the process of arranging to see a therapist and am hoping this will be a big help.
2004,"I want to take the other approach of seeking psychotherapy in addition to medication, but my previous experience with a college-provided mental health provider makes me doubt how helpful it would be."
2005,"**tl;dr: The cynical side of me doubts how effective therapy could be, but the optimist wants to fight this anxiety on all fronts."
2006,"**  
  
Has anyone had doubts about therapy but ended up benefitting from it?"
2007,"I'm getting set up to see a therapist soon (after my mom checks to see what our insurance will cover), so I do realize I probably can't fix everything myself just by reading a book."
2008,The doctor will subtly hint at seeing a psychiatrist or therapist.
2009,"It is somewhat helpful that DM has some psych skills as originally he wanted to be a therapist and he knows that when I am having them it is better to just mostly let me alone, maybe jokingly remind me in a way that breathing is useful to living and let it be as opposed to work's constant omg are you okay?"
2010,I'm not looking for a therapist or anything.
2011,I don't have a prescription for any medications as they're pretty hard to obtain where I'm from unless you pay for therapy (which I can't afford).
2012,"I saw a therapist for a while but all she could comment on was how I was ""more productive and than a lot of people""."
2013,I've done years of therapy and meditation and I guess it's helped me a lot but there is always this baseline anxiety.
2014,"I'm seeing a therapist, on medication, and have sought help from my university."
2015,i went to a therapist who was unhelpful.
2016,"When there is a manageable amount of people around, I don't have this problem and can handle a variety of situations and meet my anxiety before it gets out of control by using techniques learned in therapy."
2017,"I've spoken to a doctor and they've recommended therapy, which I plan on doing, to deal with my anxiety."
2018,"I have been in therapy before, but I don't see the point in going to a therapist until I head back to the States which is in two months."
2019,"I want to go on a combination of both therapy and antidepressants, because I feel like therapy itself may not be enough for me."
2020,"I was seeing a therapist who I was comfortable with for 3 weeks before I left, and things were looking good."
2021,"My mother, who I barely trust, but was encouraged by my therapist to tell about my issues, is not helping at all."
2022,So I've started seeing a therapist about anxiety about vomiting.
2023,My therapist said I should do a survey of 10 people about their level of awareness of sensations in your stomach.
2024,I have thought about going in and talking to someone either a therapist or my doctor I am just curious if anyone else has had anything similar and what they have done.
2025,"Ive started seeing a therapist, and am not on any meds yet (see a doc on Mon.)."
2026,"I mean I know I have a tendency to keep a certain amount of distance between me and everyone around me because it seems safer that way, and after all I have my therapist to unload everything on when I see her."
2027,"A few months ago I told my therapist my anxiety was getting better and I was having fewer panic attacks and eventually we determined it really wasn't better, I just avoid any situation that could trigger a panic attack or that might cause an increase in my anxiety."
2028,ive tried therapy and meds and im gonna try em again except my dads not really giving me much time to fix my problems at all.
2029,"I've experienced relationship anxiety before, and it caused me to explode on the person, break up with them in a terrible way and forced me to seek therapy."
2030,I've made an appointment with my therapist and I see her this week.
2031,"I'm going to my therapist tomorrow but as for now, how can I calm myself?"
2032,"Prior to that, during my last 2 years of high school, I was having panic attacks and trouble sleeping, and was recommended to a therapist by a doctor due to my inability to sleep."
2033,"I saw this therapist maybe 3 or 4 times in the beginning of my senior year prior to my suicide attempt, and then (as recommended to a doctor) began seeing her over the course of 3-4 months following that attempt."
2034,"Also, the therapist at my school is no help; he advocates an alternative method called ""emotional freedom technique"" that involves ""tapping"" into acupressure points to relieve stress."
2035,I've tried broaching the subject of therapy and it was completely rejected.
2036,"I'm still debating seeing a therapist, but in the meantime, does anyone have any tricks that they've taught themselves in order to calm down enough to just get stuff done?"
2037,This feeling is what made you come to therapy.
2038,So I finally went to a therapist today for a longstanding issue with anxiety.
2039,The therapist didn't seem very interested in anything but my current social issues.
2040,"I have never been to a therapist before, so I don't know what is to be expected when you need help with something like general anxiety, or when the person you are seeking help from cannot prescribe medications."
2041,I've been going to therapy for a few months now.
2042,"it's going great, my therapist is awesome but every."
2043,My anxiety has been getting worse and worse and Ive been to therapy a few times but I keep quitting but Ive decided to really go back and try.
2044,"I've been struggling with severe anxiety-type stuff my whole life (not officially diagnosed yet, social anxiety, panic disorder, chronic depression, avoidant, something along those lines), but have only been in therapy since April."
2045,Both my therapist &amp; I agree a few weeks of inpatient would be good for me.
2046,"I can't talk to a therapist, a doctor or anyone."
2047,"* I've seen multiple doctors, therapists, and psychologists for the sleep and anxiety over the past 5 years - no one has been able to pinpoint a solution."
2048,"I've had ""talk"" therapy, but that doesn't seem to help."
2049,"I understand the reasons for the therapy and the logic behind depression, but talking about it won't make the problem go away, in my mind."
2050,I saw a therapist who was knowledgeable on the subject and she worked with me on stress management.
2051,"And at $25 a pop, there's only so much I can do with a therapist like that."
2052,"Then a couple of weeks ago, I had a really high blood pressure reading at the therapist (about 154/100) -- needless to say I freaked out, badly -- panic attacks the rest of the day."
2053,"A Google search revealed about a million therapists my city of differing specialties and degrees, and I have absolutely no idea where to start."
2054,"I haven't been able to go to therapy because of my work schedule, and today I called in sick because I was so ashamed of my panic attack and just couldn't pull myself together enough to go to work, and now I'm terrified of going in tomorrow."
2055,"For those of you who have participated in group therapy at some point, was there ever any particular activity/handout/topic that you found helpful?"
2056,"- 

I can only see my therapist once every two weeks (if that) and I just feel like I can't turn to anyone anymore for anything, which is making me feel like I'm drowning every moment of the way."
2057,When I was younger it was easier to moderate with therapy and occasional exercising/diet change.
2058,"Unfortunately I find myself in my late 20s and things have gotten out of control (at least a full panic attack per week, anxious non-stop) so my therapist suggested talking to a psychiatrist and perhaps taking some meds."
2059,so I'm also aware of the benefits of a combo of therapy and medication.
2060,I don't know if I should try to get medication/therapy if in a couple months I won't even be living here anymore.
2061,"I tried asking her to see a therapist, but she brushed it off immediately and change the subject."
2062,Then I attended group therapy called Intensive Outpatient Therapy.
2063,I'm also seeing a therapist on a regular basis.
2064,Kind of makes you wonder why do we have therapy and hard work if we can just reprogram our subconcious?
2065,I wonder if there are any therapists that would reveal some inside info.
2066,Over the past year I've been in kind of a crazy relationship which is a story for a different day but towards the end of the relationship I started seeing a therapist because I was having a lot of difficulty with some of the facets of the relationship plus I had alot of other personnel shit go on during the year.
2067,And now that the relationship is over and i'm readjusting my focus onto myself and exploring certain things in therapy I realize just how much I overthink EVERYTHING and how much it absolutely kills the joy in doing said things.
2068,"I'm considering starting therapy but feel strange about going to talk to someone who doesn't know me about my problems, especially since my problems don't feel legitimate to me, so I guess I'm just coming here just for the sake of going somewhere for now."
2069,"I don't want therapy, I don't want to be on medication."
2070,"I currently don't have the money for a therapist or anything, and I'm also having issues with my mother, who happens to be the biggest trigger for my anxiety."
2071,"I worry by nature, and I have a history of mental problems: Depression, ADD, Anger issues and I had a period during 7th grade where I was so afraid of the dark that I had to talk to a therapist who told me I suffered from anxiety."
2072,I have talked to my doctor and I can get a referral to a therapist to handle my anxiety.
2073,However I also talked to the school therapist after I had my border-of-psychosis-experience and she told me that I could come to her if I needed it.
2074,I was going to call my therapist then realized that we have never really talked about this kind of thing when at this kind of intensity.
2075,It's days like today that when therapists see me they try to through the Borderline label at me.
2076,"I am currently seeing a psychotherapist, and am experimenting (with my physician) with different dosages/medicines."
2077,"Had a great convo, got prescribed Klonopin and Lexapro and I'm going back in 2 weeks for cognitive behavioral therapy."
2078,Background info: I'm a 22 year old girl and see a therapist weekly.
2079,"I'm seeing a psychiatrist at a therapist's recommendation in September, but I would really like somebody with experience with anxiety to sort of help me get an idea of what's going on in my head."
2080,"I have been through a lot of talk therapy in the past but I'm hoping to do some Cognitive Behavioural therapy in the future, and hopefully that will help ease my fear of this reaction and keep it from happening again!"
2081,"im 18yo, female, and i've self diagnosed myself w/ generalized anxiety and social anxiety (i dont have the funds or ability to visit a therapist or doctor for a proper diagnosis but this is what i have determined)."
2082,I'm waiting to be seen by a therapist.
2083,I just called a few minutes ago and scheduled an appointment for therapy on Thursday.
2084,"So, on Thursday I'm starting therapy for the first time."
2085,"I only went to two days of therapy as a kid when my parents divorced, I'm 22 now."
2086,She recommended me to do therapy and try Gabapentin (anticonvulsant).
2087,Ever since I started on my Prozac and started going to therapy my panic attacks went from 1-4 a day to about 1-4 a month and recently only getting one if something big happens and not just out of the blue.
2088,"I'm wondering if I should push for therapy, though?"
2089,"That summer, I talked to my doctor about ADD, and went to therapy for 3 months before being prescribed 30mg of Vyvanse, which was then upped to 50mg after another 2ish months."
2090,"It was a position as a massage therapist, and now I have tendinitis-like pain in my forearms."
2091,"I'm 14 and I'm going to a therapist due to my severe depression and manic depression, the therapist hasn't replied any of my calls nor my parents calls."
2092,"I went to a lot of therapy when i was a child, but haven't gone since i was 12."
2093,"I see a therapist and take meds for my anxiety, but it's so hard."
2094,I am going to look for a therapist and try my hardest to just open up.
2095,"I have spent years in therapy trying to overcome my ""mommy"" issues, and I have come to realize that I am trying to seek approval through other people."
2096,"That gives me hope that, with work on anxiety through therapy (and probably meds soon), I will get back to that place of rational thought."
2097,This week I contacted a few psychotherapists and hope to get an appointment in the next weeks.
2098,Did you see a psychotherapist and most importantly did it help you?
2099,"I'm on MedicAid, my insurance definitely won't cover a hospital stay so that I could afford it, but I have been seeing a therapist for a few weeks now."
2100,"I made a second appointment with a therapist, the first appointment I didn't divulge most of the most consuming aspects of my everyday struggles."
2101,"The thought that the meds could make me that way scares the shit out of me and starts my negative thought cycle, but after working with a therapist I got better about that."
2102,"I know I should consider therapy, but some advice until then would be really helpful."
2103,"I regularly do Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, exposure therapy, reading books, etc."
2104,"Last year i finally decided to get my shit together and decided to see a ""Cognitive behavioral therapist"" and it felt like a total waste of time and money."
2105,"This is where you can help :


1) I really want to see another therapist."
2106,I've been to two psychiatrists and two therapists for my GAD.
2107,"And on top of that, I've tried seeing two therapists."
2108,I have a therapist but her answer is simply to tell me it's ok to take care of myself.
2109,My therapist told me to try yoga but I'm not going to lose weight by doing yoga.
2110,I'm looking for tips on how to break up with one's therapist.
2111,"In the past, I've been very lucky to have had therapists that have been a great fit from the start, and I haven't had to ""shop around"" at all."
2112,"I got a new therapist when I moved back to my hometown, and I don't think it's working out."
2113,"He's also very different from the therapists I've seen in the past- in the past, I always saw women therapists, mostly younger women or women around my Mom's age (40's-50's)."
2114,"Although he was different  from therapists I've seen in the past, I wanted to give him a chance because he came highly recommended."
2115,"For one thing, I have Asperger's syndrome as well (though it's very mild/I'm very high functioning), and even though the anxiety is affecting me more than my AS right now, I want a therapist that is specifically trained to work with individuals that have AS/has experience working with AS individuals."
2116,"Also, I think he's placing more of an emphasis on meditation vs. other types of therapy (CBT, etc."
2117,"Long story short, I want to look for another therapist."
2118,I have my next session with this therapist today.
2119,"I'm more worried that he'll convince me to stay- I'm a big people pleaser/hate hurting people's feelings, and if he gives a convincing argument, I'm worried that I'll agree to another session when my time could be more productive searching for a new therapist."
2120,"Luckily, one of the therapists I had called earlier got back to me today and we scheduled an appointment for next week."
2121,I've gone through therapy and am currently on a prozac/welbutrin combo that I've done well with and Ativan 1mg 3x a day.
2122,"But she’s back: church, group therapy, the shopping strip where I work."
2123,I don't want her to be my therapist.
2124,"Whenever I ask my doctor or therapist if it is okay to start exercising again, they tell me ""if I feel ready"", which should not be as difficult a question to answer as it is."
2125,"I know it's ridiculous to think about it because he hasn't mentioned it once since then but i've always had that mindset of ""if i fuck up, they're going to be mad at me forever""  even going as far as texting my therapist (something i've never done before) about how i'm feeling."
2126,I dont see my therapist till tuesday but i really just want to talk to someone and i feel like i cant tell any of my friends
2127,All he could do was refer me to a therapist.
2128,When my panic disorder started (last August) I was given a prescription for xanax to use alongside therapy as needed.
2129,Insurance isn't paying for therapy anymore so I was left with the xanax.
2130,My therapist and PCP suggested the best road would be another SSRI.
2131,I really don't want to go to a therapist because I don't want to have to pay someone to listen to my problems.
2132,"We can't afford a therapist for me to go to so I cant go that route, and there's an Anxiety Treatment Center 30-50min away which i have no knowledge of the costs."
2133,So I have been seeing a therapist after I woke up one night last year in panic with chest pain and a racing heart.
2134,Anyway with therapy and yoga I was really starting to feel better and forget about everything until Wednesday night of this week.
2135,I have seen plenty of therapists and I've been on a few different SSRIs in the past.
2136,I turned to medication when I actively engaged in therapy last year and was put on Clonazepam (regular dosage and as needed for attacks) and run through the gauntlet for depression meds until I ended up with Wellbutrin.
2137,"The times that I've went to a therapist, all they've done was recommend me anti-depressants..."
2138,So I am looking for a therapist to see about anxiety/depression/grief.
2139,I know that only Psychiatrists can prescribe drugs but I think I found a good therapist who is a psychologist.
2140,By the time senior year came around I started going to therapy and talking about my problems.
2141,and scheduled my therapist's sessions once every *three* weeks.
2142,"I saw a therapist twice a week every week until I left I for college, and it has been relatively dormant since then."
2143,Having gone to therapy I know that my biggest problem is losing control.
2144,I'm starting therapy soon.
2145,And if my levels are in the normal range right now I will call my therapist.
2146,"To myself, my doctor, my girlfriend, my therapist."
2147,I do have an anxiety issue and I am seeing a therapist.
2148,My therapist thinks that I am procrastinating because I am so scared of working hard again and failing anyway that I would rather give myself an excuse for not passing than change my mindset.
2149,"No drugs, only therapy - my therapist is a clinical psychologist."
2150,"I've had cognitive behavioural therapy for the flying thing, which the therapist ended early because he thought I was alright, when really I felt like I'd ""caught on"" to what the therapy was trying to do and it didn't work."
2151,"I've seen psychiatrists and been in the psychiatric hospital twice because I was told it would make me more stable on my meds and therefore make them work better, but never really been in therapy."
2152,"I thought, maybe I can go to a therapist they won't push me to take meds and I can just figure out how to overcome this."
2153,"So, a couple of times now I've come to therapy with nothing written in my journal."
2154,"My therapist kinda laughs at me and says, ""Come on, I can't do this for you."
2155,"Another person's opinion would be appreciated here because I don't know if somehow I am being difficult and don't realize it, or if maybe I just never needed therapy, or if this therapist isn't right for me."
2156,my therapist was really helpful and i felt myself getting stronger on my own.
2157,"Frankly, I just don't have the money to sit down with a therapist every week."
2158,"I have been to a Therapist (though only twice) and I felt like that didn't help at all, just gave me 2 days to feel sick about going to see the therapist and feel slightly better for 1-2 hours after it and that's all."
2159,"A group therapist visits/is visited once a week or so to help with the dynamic, group walks are held semi-daily as an alternative to sit-down meetings, and some meals are probably prepared at regular times for practical reasons; but routines are kept minimal to allow as much time as possible for individual schedules and group projects."
2160,"After being in a stressed out, bad place I started seeing a therapist, and tomorrow I'm seeing a psychiatrist to look into getting some form of meds."
2161,I told my therapist about how my sleep problems have gotten worse recently and she asked me what I think about while going to sleep.
2162,But about two months ago he revealed to me that he was suffering from anxiety and did not want to seek help due to therapy being expensive.
2163,I went to a physiotherapists who was kind of weird and after my 2nd meeting I basically told her everything was fine cause she gave such an odd impression.
2164,I do go to a therapist but we mostly talk about sleep and I feel like I have problems bringing other stuff up.
2165,"TL;DR: Injuredy wrist, physiotherapists says don't worry, I still do, can't get over it, can't get myself to a Dr, just generally frustrated and angry at myself for being who I am and doing what I do."
2166,"For now I'm going to talk with my therapist and continuously learn new techniques for dealing with my anxiety, so hopefully learning those techniques will be useful (as they have in the past)."
2167,I have never tried therapy due to lack of finances to do so.
2168,"Well, soon I will have full access to therapy/counseling/what have you if I so choose to take the opportunity."
2169,However I have a huge rising fear in me of the therapy itself.
2170,What if my therapist is mean?
2171,What was therapy like for you?
2172,I've been in therapy for years and it helped me quite a lot for school and leisure.
2173,"I went to therapy and counseling, having screaming nightmares for months and months."
2174,"I'll be starting therapy again soon and I'll eventually get to this topic, but for now, it'd be cool if someone could relate."
2175,Later I described the feeling to my therapist.
2176,How do I go about actually getting therapy and making sure I get a good doctor for this?
2177,"He sent me to a speech therapist to get rid of the hyperventilating, and to a psychotherapist."
2178,The psychotherapists couldn't talk me out of it.
2179,"They eventually send me to have cognitive and behavioural therapy, the premise of which is more or less: carry on, it’s all right."
2180,"The last couple of years, in the spirit of the cognitive and behavioural therapy, I’ve been forcing myself to attend lectures and meet with friends, and behold, sometimes things seemed to get better, but I always fell back after a little while."
2181,"Neither my therapist nor my doctor have any ideas of who to ask, since dogs trained to help with PTSD are a new development."
2182,"I really need to talk to my therapist, but of course his office is closed because of the holiday."
2183,"I know I shouldn't keep medical info from my therapist, but I don't want to get myself or my girlfriend in any kind of trouble."
2184,My parents aren't exactly the most supportive of therapy.
2185,"My dad in particular has stated how he feels that my sister, who is going through therapy as well for a lot more issues than I have, is just being used for a graduate student's research paper."
2186,"I'm trying to be more open to them about how I actually feel, and I feel like I should tell them I'm also in therapy."
2187,"As title says, I am wondering how your therapists have helped all of you."
2188,"I am currently dropping $40 a session, 1x a week on a therapist."
2189,"I am working on this with my therapist, but I think I only just realized it's not normal :/

I'm newly dating someone."
2190,"I'm working with my therapist, but any personal anecdotes that might help?"
2191,I have days were I am full of hope and think once I am able to afford therapy this summer I will learn to cope with this disorder and lead a more normal life.
2192,Going to therapy has made me aware of my irrational thought patterns but I can't stop them yet.
2193,"I have abandonment issues but they don't stem from my childhood or anything (unless having a father work away for a month and then be home for 2 weeks counts), therapist thinks they come from past relationships."
2194,"And the ways to fix it are difficult (therapy, finding right meds, diet, exercise, meditation, socialization)."
2195,"I've been out of it for four years now, because my doctor suggested to go therapy which I did."
2196,"I will continue pushing to get better, continue my therapy and medication, and try to focus more of my energy on those who actually care about my wellbeing."
2197,I'm looking for a therapist now and hopefully it won't be that stressful with the cost.
2198,It makes me sad that I'm in therapy (have been for years) and on Effexor XR (which keeps my depression controlled but should help my anxiety as well) yet I am still an absolute trainwreck without klonopin.
2199,"*

She's also the most effective therapist that I've had."
2200,She's really nice and is the first therapist that I've had that seems to really understand what's going on in my head (probably because of our common age group and that she's been in school recently and is familiar with the newest anxiety work).
2201,Is it OK to keep up with the same therapist?
2202,"I want to see a therapist, but I would like to hear if there is anyone out there like me."
2203,"the last semester of my master was terrible, i felt so terrible and sick all the time (unfortunately the guy i met couldnt hold himself an went back to his parents and got a therapy, i loved him, he knew it, i think he liked me to, but we were unable to show it one another)
i was alone, it got worse, i finished the semester, and found immediatly a master thesis."
2204,"i never said something like that to him (beside that, i'm fat and i think i must loo terrible when i'm hanging my shoulders and when i try to escape in mein boobs, you know what i mean, i'm a itsy bitsy smurf)
he never has time for me, like ""pragmaticgirl we will meet tomorrow at 9 o'clock"" ok, it is 9 o'clock he isnt there, at 10 he calls me, lets meet after lunch, after lunch he says next day, next day... and so on, i dont exagerate, i even went to a therapist because i couldnt hold myself, to wait for him and wait and wait just so he can say that i didnt do enough, its the worst feeling i ever felt."
2205,I hate myself thinking I had this under control and not continuing therapy.
2206,"As stated before, I can't afford therapy."
2207,"I am a college student, with a heavy workload, no job and who's insurance will not cover therapy."
2208,"My college offers a counselling service, however it's not a serious one, and anything which falls under a serious issue gets referred out to a therapist (which I can't afford)."
2209,"I cannot ask my parents to get me therapist, the last time I did my mother freaked out."
2210,"She then mentioned getting one 2 1/2 hours away, because getting a therapist is shameful and she would not want others finding out."
2211,"I've tried the anxiety exercises, cognitive behavioural therapy, but only anxiety medicine (clonazepam) calms me enough to function."
2212,"Yesterday, I called the local Health Centre (you call them and they call you back and book a time with a doctor or therapist and you go there, and if it's too big for them you go to the hospital) yesterday and told them about my anxiety."
2213,"I got a telephone time with a therapist today, and we just finished talking."
2214,"She also booked a face-to-face meeting with a therapist for me, but she couldn't say when, only ""in a couple of weeks""."
2215,"My therapist thinks it developed from childhood trauma, and I've seen a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with depression/general anxiety/dissociative disorder NOS."
2216,I have been attending therapy for my anxiety for about 3 or four years now.
2217,Around 5 or 6 months ago my therapist sent me to a psychiatrist who ended up putting me on the medication train.
2218,Started therapy and SSRI's immediately.
2219,I tried seeing a new therapist where I live now but it wasn't helpful.
2220,I live to far away from my other therapist to start seeing him again.
2221,"It's not a fiery passion I can simply release to my therapist in a few sessions, it's like a corruption eating away at me."
2222,It's nothing extraordinary I'm seeking - just weekly (at least) sessions with a therapist with whom I've worked before.
2223,"The reason I am here, now, is that I've realized my problems will improve only with regularly scheduled and frequent therapy sessions (as opposed to the session-here-session-there style of treatment I was getting before)."
2224,"How can I help myself (with therapy, or similar) if I can't help myself (with money cash dollars)?"
2225,I went to see my doctor and he prescribed me with Lexapro and suggested I attend cognitive behavioral therapy.
2226,"Hi Folks 

i've been up all night running this question through my head, and i still don't know why this happens, so with another 2 days left before my next therapy session, i'd thought i'd run this past you 

i've been in therapy for a good few months now, and i've improved a hell of a lot (way more than i could ever have hoped for )

yet for some reason i have these feelings of guilt , its like i tell my self that because i'm in therapy then i should be really struggling, its as if i feel that i don't deserve to be doing as good as i am."
2227,I made a therapy appointment after I was prescribed anxiety medication a few weeks ago.
2228,"I'm also afraid of the possibility of exposure therapy, even though I know it would most likely ultimately end up being helpful."
2229,"I'm trying what my therapist suggested in telling myself why I'm NOT a shitty person, and I'm trying to count to activate a different part of my brain, and I'm watching a show I like on Netflix and nothing is working."
2230,She has never seen a therapist of any kind.
2231,A little bit of backstory: I have been in and out of therapy for 3 years and I am 19 years of age.
2232,I have in the past been prescribed prozac and zopiclone but I found therapy to be ineffective and stopped all treatment.
2233,I will also be put back on all medication I was previously on and most likely referred for therapy.
2234,"Also what should I do to find a therapist/psychiatrist for help/ a proper diagnosis, This is the first time I've really asked other people for help."
2235,Is there a specific therapist for my age group and gender?
2236,What generally happens in the first few session of seeing a therapist?
2237,"I realize this is very abnormal, and I'm planning on telling my therapist about this soon as possible."
2238,I started going to a therapist when I knew that I just couldn't handle this myself anymore.
2239,"In the time since I last went to my therapist, I've taken a turn for the worst."
2240,NOTE:  im not talking about therapy or medicines.
2241,Went to our marriage therapist today and told him and he wants me to see the physcologist and go on anxiety meds which I was always against but Im now considering.
2242,I finally called to make an appointment to speak to a therapist only to cancel it a day later.
2243,"I am scared the therapist will tell me what I fear most, than I am bi-polar and need to be hospitalized."
2244,"* I've been to lots of therapy, psychiatric health programs, and other bullshit like that."
2245,I've seen a therapist and have taken anti depressants.
2246,"My therapist likes to remind me that ""you miss every shot you don't take"" and I know that."
2247,"(Oh and I have finally arranged to see a therapist once a week)

I am going to beat this."
2248,I went to a therapist and got breathing exercises.
2249,My therapist says she can't help me more than she does now and is thinking of sending me to an internal place where they can help me.
2250,"I try not to resent her for this, or resent her for letting her mental health prevent her from going back to work and pushing our family into debt while my dad, who suffers from anxiety as well but has had successful therapy, slaves away to support her."
2251,"I'm on medication and will be going to therapy again soon, but haven't gone in almost ten years."
2252,I have weekly group therapy meetings from 4:30 to 6 on Tuesdays.
2253,"It would be cool, but I'll get a lot more out of going to group therapy (been dealing with SA, self esteem issues, self hatred, etc.)."
2254,I missed our organization meeting last week because group therapy went too long and I had to use the classic doctor excuse.
2255,"On top of all this, I've had a lot of feelings for my ""boss"" lately and I really don't want her to know that I need/want to go to group therapy right now."
2256,"She's already way better than me so she'd have to step down to my level in order for anything to happen between us, but I don't want that gap to get bigger if she finds out that I'm a fuckhead and need/want to group therapy every week."
2257,"So I started doing what my mom, who, is a psychotherapist, told me to tell myself."
2258,I mentioned getting a mini trampoline for our 6 year old to help with physical therapy and he had what looked like a panic attack/meltdown at the mere thought of it-his thought patterns went off the mark and he seemed unable to control his thoughts/emotions.
2259,"He does take a anti-depressant/anxiety med-Lexapro, and will not go to a therapist."
2260,"I saw the signs that I was headed for a bad place, but I've been trying to mask the symptoms with medication and declining therapy."
2261,"I'm going to meet my therapist again tomorrow (8th time), it's so pointless, she doesn't understand a single thing, she literally makes fun of me when i try to explain something."
2262,"The host is a Naturopathic Doctor in Canada, but the tips are generally broadly what you'd hear in a good therapy session."
2263,"E: Yes I am in therapy, but only about a month yet..."
2264,I have been on many different meds and have seen a therapist.
2265,"Besides the fact that the therapist made untrue assumptions and jumped to conclusions and was condescending and made me feel like I was wasting her time... she said that CBT is for short-term problems, while I've had bad anxiety at least since I was 14 (almost 10 years)."
2266,The therapist said her job is to decide on goals with me and then I have to go out and do them.
2267,I've been going to therapy for several months which has begun to help but it tends to feel like  the therapy only really has an effect on my progress right before (when I imagine what we might talk about) or during.
2268,"Hey guys, I've never been to a therapist or been diagnosed but one thing I know for certain is that I'm a very anxious person and a therapist could probably give me a label =P

I don't know if it's necessary to describe my symptoms..."
2269,Is it impossible to go forward without therapy?
2270,Do I need therapy?
2271,I've been going to therapy and so my anxiety has subsided over the last several months.
2272,"I feel as though this is partly why meditation and therapy has not helped me, since I ultimately conclude that no effect is taking place and subsequently become more anxious."
2273,"I've finally woke up, kept up with counseling, psychotherapy and mindfulness meditation sessions, and struggled through school to get caught up on homework and chapters."
2274,"I was in therapy for that phobia off and on throughout my childhood, but really didn't make much headway with conquering it."
2275,"I started feeling like there had to be something I could do to help myself with my anxiety, so I asked my therapist if I could try some kind of medication (at 13 years old)."
2276,"I've tried meds, therapy, acupuncture, yoga, meditation, supplements, etc."
2277,"After therapy involving CBT and delving into my traumas, mediation, yoga, running, mindfulness, books, this sub, and most importantly learning to trust myself and the world I am finally happy."
2278,"CBT seems to be the most common psychotherapy for anxiety, but my therapist's approach is mindfulness-oriented."
2279,Does anyone have experience with this type of therapy?
2280,I will be seeking therapy due to my anxiety and fear getting so much worse over the past few months.
2281,"It's hard for me to visit, because my mom's anxiety is so completely overwhelming (I also have anxiety and I've been in therapy for about two years)."
2282,"I've talked with her a lot about therapy and how much it's helped me, but she is deep in her depression/anxiousness and won't listen to reason, logic, anything remotely critical, or constructive feedback."
2283,"The main driver for me, when I was miserably anxious, was my friends -- they encouraged me to seek therapy."
2284,"I don't know what tactic to take, because if I suggest therapy to my mom, she sees it as a personal attack."
2285,"I know I can't make her go to therapy, but she needs help."
2286,"I've taken pills and had therapy (for the depression, not anxiety), but slowly stopped that as I didn't really feel that it was working."
2287,"I was wondering if anyone knows if I describe my symptoms to the doctor, if they would offer me medication for my anxiety, or will they just try more therapy?"
2288,"I'm sick of therapy, it doesn't help even after a million different therapists."
2289," When i was in 5-6th grade i had to get up and make a presentation to the class, after 5 words i was shaking like a leaf, couldn't breath or carry on speaking, been that way ever since any sort of attention on me to speak or read in front of even a few people , i wouldnt be able to say more than a sentence, now im at uni and i need to get over this as all we do is presentations and oral examinations, and i m skipping these classes because im to embarrassed to choke in front of everyone, please does anyone have any advice, and not the usuall"" take a deep breath, practice the day before at home alone , or imagine the audience naked"" none of these work for me, im considering psychological therapy but need some advice first, what does reddit think?"
2290,"I've been to therapy, but she can only do so much."
2291,Today i got my first appointment to see my psychotherapist about my crippling anxiety/Agoraphobia/depression... he asked me many questions throughout as you would expect... however i was slightly irked by the fact that he was constantly cutting me off and leaving me unable to explain myself... he then ended the session by saying that my personality was not helping my anxiety as i needed to mature myself... i'm 20 years old of course i'm not fully mature however i feel that i am fairly mature for my age and i took it kind of insultingly...
2292,"I took therapy for about 3 years or so, and then they stopped, deeming me ""anxiety-free""."
2293,I'm also about to go into therapy but I don't know if it's even affordable or if it will even help.
2294,I leave next week to live in my apartment and I have an appointment with a therapist there.
2295,"I saw a therapist while I was at university a couple of times, but now I'm back at home on a placement with no one really to talk to."
2296,"I'm so glad I finally found this sub 

I've had anxiety since I was really young, nobody knew what it was at the time though 

so my greatest phobia is of choking (and I'm sorry if this has been mentioned to death, please let me know if I should remove this) 

I'm on meds for OVD/anxiety/depression and have been in therapy since January (finally), but this big fear will just not go away :/ 

I know I'm not the only one...any tiles/comfort/advice/etc?"
2297,"I've been to therapy twice and feel that I know how to cope for the most part, it's just some times too much."
2298,After quitting a job that was emotionally challenging I had what my therapist called some depersonalisation and derealisation.
2299,The therapist I'm talking to now proposed a very low dosage antipsychotic/neuroleptic.
2300,"Today I had to call and make an advising appointment at my university, I had to call and reschedule my jury duty, and I had to call this new therapists office and try to schedule an appointment."
2301,"(Now I have to wait for the therapist to call me back, so slight anxiety there)."
2302,"i realize i need to get back into therapy, and even though i REALLY appreciate that advice, it would be a bit useless to tell me because i just kind of need help for this problem now."
2303,"I'm in therapy, on a daily dose of xanax."
2304,"I know this subreddit does encourage counselling/therapy, but I'd like to be able to try relieving myself of this issue on my own before considering taking things further."
2305,"I mean I know I have a tendency to keep a certain amount of distance between me and everyone around me because it seems safer that way, and after all I have my therapist to unload everything on when I see her."
2306,I haven't been able to find a therapist or psychiatrist near me who takes my insurance so I made an appointment with a GP.
2307,"My ultimate goal is to see a therapist, but I'm graduating and will probably be moving out of state when my lease ends in July."
2308,"Even though I wasn't able to work with the therapist as long as I wished I could have, I was still able to spend the last 4-4 ½ years completely changing my life around."
2309,He asked if I wanted someone to throw pills at me or a therapist.
2310,"The one therapist I did see was great, but related to my adopted kids' therapy group, which made it hard to trust her."
2311,"So my Dr. says ""Well, my brother is a therapist who deals with adoption cases, foster children, and works with a lot of church groups."
2312,"I done it by exposure therapy - talking to random people at all possible public places, my fear finally gone forever and I became very social and confident person first time in my life."
2313,"So in July I explained my anxiety to my new therapist the best I could (I get extremely anxious while talking about my anxiety, of course.)"
2314,"She put me in a weekly therapy group, and told me that if my smyptoms are still there after 8 weeks to make another appointment with her, where she might reccomend that I take medication."
2315,"I'm afraid of not being able to explain my situation right to the therapist, and I'm also afraid of talking about it in general."
2316,I went and found myself a therapist and started my first session.
2317,Do you think my new therapist would disagree with this?
2318,I'm not really interested in a therapist or in meds.
2319,"Info:
* Just turned 16
* Family of 4, loving parents
* 19 yo sister who causes immense stress
* Good group of friends
* Am seeing a therapist, though only about once every 2 months
* Male

Recently, my anxiety and (maybe?)"
2320,"i have talked about this to my therapist a bit, but we've only had 1 session so far."
2321,So I finally started therapy after considering it for 5 years.
2322,"The thing is, I've never seen a therapist before so I don't really know what the norm is."
2323,One of the main issues I have difficulty with in therapy is trying not to view myself as abnormal and inferior to those who do not have depression or a type of anxiety disorder.
2324,"A couple of years ago, I followed a speech therapy that significantly reduced it."
2325,"It's messing me up, I'm on a waiting list with my doctor to see a CBT therapist but it's taking forever to get referred."
2326,"I have an appointment with a therapist next week, but any wisdom you can provide would be appreciated!"
2327,Therapist said we're going to do DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) to help me overcome my issues.
2328,I managed to get over time quite quickly by going to a physiotherapist who teached me a quick breathing exercise + who worked on my muscles and joints.
2329,My mother is going through chemotherapy.
2330,"Once at work I felt a little bit safer, made an appointment with my physiotherapist that evening, and told a few collegeaus about my 'hyperventilation'."
2331,My physiotherapist realised the breathing exercise didn't really work and just helped with relaxing my muscles.
2332,"I have a doctors' appointment on monday evening, but I now she'll talk about the options for a) therapy, b) antidepressants."
2333,"But both therapy (waiting list) as antidepressants (need a few weeks to work) aren't an immediate help...
And at this point, just sitting at home, i can NOT cope.."
2334,I think i might need therapy.
2335,I also wont be able to see a therapist until she gets back.
2336,"I saw the school therapist today, which sort of helped."
2337,"I'm seeing a therapist right now that specializes in cognitive behavior, listening to a self-help tape that gives me the kick in the butt I need, but I also want to know how to prepare myself for such a trip and not feel panicky/stressed/scared."
2338,"I was in therapy this morning (she knows all this) and saw my doctor today, so I'm doing what I can do for myself."
2339,"My former therapist said constant driving and not letting it impact my life would be the best way for me to get over it, but it's been 3 months in and my anxiety has barely lessened."
2340,"If no antidepressants have worked, no therapies have worked, although that may be because I don't seem to be able to stick with them."
2341,"I've tried multiple meds (anti-depressants made me suicidal), therapy, and herbal supplements (L-Theanine, Lemon Balm, etc)."
2342,I started going to therapy once a week for my anxiety and agoraphobia back in February after having suffered from anxiety for the past 4 years or so (I'm 19 now).
2343,Nothing that I've been told in therapy is anything I haven't heard or read about before.
2344,I think the only good thing about the therapy is that it gets me out of the house.
2345,"I don't ever feel like I'm truly being listened to, both in and out of therapy."
2346,"I really don't know what to do or where to start on fixing my life, but I thought that was what the therapy was supposed to be for?"
2347,"I've been in therapy for two years, and I've quit 2 weeks ago."
2348,"Tomorrow I normally would go back to therapy, but not this time (since I quit)."
2349,"Sometimes I wish I could take a ""magical fix it all pill"", but my therapist was against it."
2350,The last time I was able to regularly see a therapist I was fourteen years old.
2351,"I tried to even see a therapist regularly about this, but he was complete shit and basically of no help."
2352,"I'm planning on finding a good therapist in my area, but I figured I'd ask here for now."
2353,"In closing I'm going to see a therapist free of charge which is a blessing but she is very good friends with my mom and since this woman is the first person my mother calls after I take a stand in our arguments, I'm already painted in an awful light and believe she will be more inclined to be biased, if not harmful/dangerous to my mental well being."
2354,My psychiatrist suggested I see a therapist in his practice.
2355,I also have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow @ 8am.
2356,"I've done therapy and medication, and I'm very capable of dating and setting something good up...but I can't afford do spiral down again if that happens."
2357,"I'm looking for a therapist, but I've never felt like therapy has had much of an effect on me, either."
2358,he's still a few weeks out from being able to make good use of therapy.
2359,"I'm in therapy right now for anxiety and insomnia, however it's not helping at all."
2360,I saw my therapist and told him why I had disappeared.
2361,"feeling like therapy isn't doing it for me (this is the second time ive been to therapy btw- saw a psychologist for a few months last year and got the same, it's nice to talk but not really going anywhere experience)."
2362,"Im on zoloft, my psychotherapist thinks if i get more social everything will go away and is trying to help me talk to people and stuff."
2363,"I've been on a variety of medications, a bunch of different doctors and therapists."
2364,"Almost 2 years ago I saw a new therapist, went through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy."
2365,This therapy helped me SO much.
2366,"I've mentioned therapy, but I'm not sure if it is something she's actually interested in."
2367,"After a panic attack during a presentation which involved a lot of handshaking and hyperventilating, I decided to see a therapist."
2368,"However, the clinic associated with my university was a behavioral therapy and not a medication type place."
2369,I have an addictive personality and easily lose track of what I'm doing with psych/ anxiety meds- so I avoid them and can only receive relief via therapy.
2370,"I'm desperate for help, but therapy is pointless for me, and I'm not sure if any doctor can give me medication, since I'm a minor and it may make the situation worse."
2371,"So
 what's the difference between al therapist and a phycologist(wrong spelling)."
2372,I don't wanna try meds wanna try different types of therapy to see why I can't get over this condition.
2373,Seriously tho guys do I just walk into a clinic and ask for a referral or just go find a therapist locally an book an appointment?
2374,My parents are reluctant to get a therapist involved.
2375,"I'm on a waiting list for therapy, but there's no indication of how long it will be, and to be honest the therapy I've had in the past wasn't that helpful."
2376,"He tells me to go to therapy, but I already spent a lot of money doing that for several months and it didn't seem to help."
2377,Life has been so good since i started the meds and therapy.
2378,"I don't want to ""diagnose"" myself with ADHD but I am also afraid to bring this fear up with my therapist."
2379,I have been seeing a therapist for a couple of months for anxiety which is mostly related to work.
2380,"Years of therapy, medication, introspection, and research have made me pretty familiar with anxiety issues in general and how I deal with them in particular."
2381,My therapist has been telling me that what I truly need to do to address my anxieties is to learn to re-focus and stop obsessing on my negative thoughts; that being more mindful of my present experience and what is going on will help counterbalance all my negative thinking that I obsess over.
2382,"And FYI, my current coping strategies include exercise, meditation, therapy, journaling, medication, and talking to friends/loved ones."
2383,"I've been seeing a therapist, have had many reassuring conversations with friends and former colleagues that I could not have done anything differently, but I feel so bad all the time, like I am living with a great burden."
2384,"My therapist is trying to get me to live comfortably with the worst case scenario, which is the idea that maybe I could have done a better job some of the time, but that's life."
2385,I don't know if I'd want to seek medical help as in a therapist.
2386,I can't afford medication or therapy.
2387,"I've been dealing with my general anxiety for quite some time, but I first started seeing a therapist to help about a year ago."
2388,I've talked about it with my therapist and she's been very encouraging and reminds me not to be discouraged and that this is something that I can do and just need to remind myself that I can.
2389,"I needed no medication, no therapy, and managed my symptoms amazingly."
2390,"I really don't think I can handle this the rest of my life, and I'm way to embarrassed to go see a therapist because I really have no reason to be feeling like this."
2391,"I've attempted CBT three tines (all with male therapists) and I wanted to punch them all in the face, it made me very angry and I quit."
2392,"DBT was much better (only had female therapists, so I'm not sure if I found it easier to relate to because the therapists were female or that the therapy itself acknowledges emotion, I dunno)."
2393,I saw an exposure therapist for the main issue I'm having.
2394,The only thing I haven't tried is therapy for trauma.
2395,"I've tried ""exposure"" therapy."
2396,I've been seeing a therapist.
2397,I know I have to find a new therapist but it's frustrating because I spent so much time building things up and having her understand my situation.
2398,This was what I was trying to explain to my lovely therapist when the sudden panic attack happened.
2399,I've just spent over 2 hours waiting at urgent care (because the earliest regular opening was in mid-May and the therapist thought I should get in earlier than that) in order to have this dr give me a Prozac prescription after having known me for all of 10 minutes.
2400,"I went to a therapist once about my anxiety about getting on a plane once, I ended up talking about  you and K the whole time."
2401,Did you find a therapy or a remedy that REALLY worked ?
2402,I'm currently on medication and going to therapy to get better.
2403,Even though I've never been to a therapist I feel I really should meet one because I feel I have the symptoms for social anxiety.
2404,"I started DBT therapy a year ago to try to eliminate panic attacks, insomnia, and inability to eat much."
2405,"He also wants to stay together while he starts therapy (also DBT, and he had an appointment today), and we begin couple's counselling using both of pour therapists (something I talked about with my own therapist and she agreed to)."
2406,"If he weren't also in therapy and if we weren't staying couple's counselling,  I'd call this a totally hopeless situation."
2407,He is starting therapy in an attempt to sort out his feelings and wants to go to couple's counseling to try to resolve issues that we can't resolve on our own.
2408,I experienced terrible panic attacks in secondary school and as a result sought out therapy to learn skills to deal with it.
2409,"I've told him exercise, better sleep, therapy, and eating better will not only help him feel better in general but may combat his anxiety as well."
2410,"------

**She desperately wants to speak to a psychiatrist** - she has attended a handful of therapy sessions and the therapist was quite surprised by her perspective on most of her external problems (alcoholic father kinda left her with some baggage, etc.)"
2411,So basically since I moved to the city I have been without regular therapy appointments and was having a hard time motivating myself to find a new one.
2412,I call my old therapist and she sent me a list of therapists in my area that use the same methods she does and thinks would be a good fit for me.
2413,Apparently she has already spoken to my old therapist back in October and has a basis of my current situation.
2414,I really hope it works since getting regular therapy sessions is integral to my well being and self care process.
2415,"I had a couple years of CBT therapy, but I know what I should be thinking, making it happen is another story."
2416,"I know I should get back to therapy to get better, but I just don't have the motivation to do it right now."
2417,"The point is, I'm too apathetic (not the right word really, but whatever) right now to do the really helpful stuff like therapy or consistent exercise/sleeping habits."
2418,"I'm not looking for life-changing shit like therapy or medicine -- that honestly sounds like too much for me right now, as stupid as that probably sounds -- I just want to get some ideas on things to make the day-to-day grind a little happier, more interesting, etc."
2419,"The talk therapy was helping, but it wasn't enough, so my doctor gave me a prescription."
2420,(oh therapists can't help) I guess its pretty closed minded.
2421,I'm going to therapy in a week or so because my parent's think I'm depressed because all I do all day is sit on the computer or play my guitar.
2422,"I'm thinking of seeing a therapist about the issue, as it is possible I have some form of social anxiety."
2423,"I sought therapy just over a year ago, around the time I began taking my prerequisite courses."
2424,"**2)** Do certain therapists specialize in certain disorders (anxiety, depression, etc.)"
2425,"**

When all the talk over the years in regards to the phobia has not helped, when none of the sites have provided me with any enlightening different approaches, when there's no logical escape from the topic of your phobia, how helpful can a talking therapy really be?"
2426,"**Also, when so much else is going on in life, can I really afford to be triggered regularly by the therapist?"
2427,"** Medical appointments for PMDD, getting on a path for diagnosis for Aspergers, possible breast cancer mutated gene (but have to wait for others in family to be tested), and re-referred to a psychotherapist who I'm still not sure of."
2428,My therapist and I have started talking about anxiety issues and I know logically nothing horrible is likely to happen.
2429,"I've tried doing it without drugs and visiting a therapist, but it has not worked."
2430,"I recently posted here about what I thought was me having a weird reaction to a new medication (clonazepam), but my therapist helped me find the real catalyst, so that's no longer really an issue."
2431,"As soon as I saw a therapist, he immediately recognized what I was suffering from."
2432,"The only things I haven't tried is therapy and medicine, I don't know what too say other than I need help, advice, and support............
(I pretty much stay in bed all day and pace a lot, I also have trouble sleeping [getting to sleep and oversleeping] and also feel that it is effecting my eating too)"
2433,"After years of pushing it down, avoiding therapy, pushing away the people I love, it's reached a critical point."
2434,I've been seeing a therapist but I don't know what therapy is supposed to be like.
2435,"I've also been kind of avoidance towards therapists as well (bad experiences, I understand CBT, it's all repetition at this point)."
2436,Unfortunately I don't want to deal with going to a therapist for a few months before for them to screen me.
2437,When she was in university she visited a therapist which helped a lot for her.
2438,My next therapy session (CBT) is tomorrow morning.
2439,"Last time I saw my therapist he sort of made me a bit annoyed and very frustrated by telling me to ""just do"" things and ""just stop"" other things."
2440,I can't just become better at things because a therapist has told me to do so.
2441,I haven't done it (and now I worry that he'll think I don't want to be in therapy etc).
2442,I have literally spent about 12-15 hours studying every day since my last therapy session.
2443,Should I talk to my therapist about this?
2444,"Since then, I was in therapy until I was 15, and I've been on medication ever since."
2445,I probably need therapy again.
2446,I tend to be judgemental and think therapy is a bunch of bull but I can't keep taking benzos forever.
2447,Tomorrow is going to be the second time I have went to the therapist.
2448,How do I approach the subject with my therapist?
2449,My therapist tells me to get busy when I feel like I want to satisfy a compulsion and go down a spiral.
2450,"My therapist tells me to ask myself ""Is this healthy for me?"
2451,"Overall I'm seeking advice but my big question is this:

Medication, self help, meditation, or therapy?"
2452,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
2453,The doctors couldnt find any physical cause and suggested she see a therapist because he thought it could be psychosomatic.
2454,"Either way, I stopped seeing the doctor and the therapist, and I stopped getting medicine."
2455,I tried therapy and found that unhelpful.
2456,I went to a therapist and I was prescribed effexor and learned to manage my anxiety.
2457,"I have been going to therapy for years, meditating, distracting myself and practicing every coping technique i know.. but then I have episodes like this and I just want to scream."
2458,"Doctors don't tell me anything factual, and I've done everything a therapist would recommend for anxiety/panic attacks, and I can't believe this is just anxiety - I had to walk for 30 minutes while barely feeling my legs."
2459,I had seen three therapist this year and one I notice seem to be dead on about him.
2460,And lots of introspection and therapy is helping me see the negative talk that is taking place.
2461,"my mom was just diagnosed with cancer so i dont want to come out to my family because i dont want them to worry about something else, and i dont have much money so how much does therapy cost?"
2462,how is therapy like?
2463,"I've had a lot of bad experiences with therapy, and I wonder what the options are when it comes to treating this."
2464,How did you bring it up to any sort of counsellor/therapist/psychiatrist/etc that you were seeing?
2465,"OK, to clarify, I've been occasionally seeing a therapist for a couple of years and after several months (okay, two) without contact i suddenly  got a letter from the hospital, telling me I had gotten an appointment for a brain scan next Tuesday."
2466,"To make things worse, the last time we met I explicitly told the therapist I didn't want to start any big investigation right now, since I'm studying full time, so this really came out of nowhere."
2467,My therapist is really being patient with me and I appreciate it.
2468,"It's scary and crippling but my therapist said I don't have any mental illnesses, not even anxiety."
2469,"In 2012, I went and saw my first therapist, but the lady was a moron and I quickly realized I was wasting $150 per session."
2470,I'm curious to hear what sort of experiences you all have had with counselors and therapists.
2471,"I've put off going to a therapist for so long because when I've gone in the past, it never helped me."
2472,So I found what seems to be a good place and had placed a call to set up an appointment with a therapist whose description/background sounded like a good match.
2473,What if therapy *doesn't* improve my anxiety?
2474,I've been thinking for awhile about trying sex therapy.
2475,Has anyone had any experience with sex therapy before?
2476,Belching and gassy and didn't want to eat most of Thursday--and had a therapist appointment (which also went pretty well)...and decided to take one dose of Pepcid with supper (should have probably been before?)
2477,"Additionally, I'll be looking into finding a therapist I can talk about this with."
2478,"Throughout the years, I've been going to therapy, and have found a combination of pills that works for me."
2479,"After 21+ years of battling my anxiety, depression, and basic self-loathing literally by myself, and having no luck with various therapists, I have finally found one who doesn't make me feel even more crazy than I already do."
2480,"I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest, and maybe figure out what the best form of therapy would be for me."
2481,He's not my therapist.
2482,Just a therapist.
2483,I have a therapist of my own but I feel like I need to share things with him too because he's my significant other.
2484,How much information is too much information when you have a history of mental illness and you're in a relationship with someone who is a therapist?
2485,I've tried psychotherapy and EMDR (I'm having my fourth EMDR session today).
2486,I've been diagnosed as a sufferer of social anxiety when I was previously attending regular therapy due to severe depression.
2487,I'm seeing a therapist for unrelated reasons but she said that's normal for a teenager but I'm not sure.
2488,What happened beginning in the 1950s with Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck is a new approach to therapy for people with anxiety disorders.
2489,"This is the basis of **cognitive behavioral therapy**, which I did for years and am cured of my generalized anxiety disorder."
2490,"I still have anxiety, as does anyone who breathes, but it doesn't even come close to the shit I suffered for 10-15 years before finding a great CBT therapist and reading about it."
2491,"Similarly, **mindfulness** and **mindfulness based cognitive therapy** teach you to ignore, in a way, your thoughts."
2492,"Very, very, very few discussions of successful therapies, links to scientific reports and research, and discussions of therapists."
2493,"People who think that the modality is not as important a good therapist of some ineffective modality are dead wrong, and the research proves it."
2494,Exposure and Response therapy is phenomenal.
2495,hey guys- anyone have success with a particular cognitive behavioral therapist/therapy in New York City?
2496,"and there were only two in my city on that ""finding a therapist"" link on the sidebar."
2497,"I'm very self-aware, so I question what good it would do for a therapist to tell me what my problems are."
2498,"I know that for most therapy sessions, you just sound off without getting concrete advice for how to move forward in life, which is troubling."
2499,Do I seek therapy or a support group?
2500,"I decide to watch it later, skip, get lunch and get ready for therapy."
2501,I missed therapy today.
2502,"I can go for therapy, but not medication."
2503,My therapist sees me for a few minutes anyway.
2504,Neither offer therapy.
2505,He said he is a Medical Doctor not a therapist and that he is only a prescriber.
2506,He told me that therapy wouldn't work well for me and it would only help after I got on meds/for the long run.
2507,"I can't go to therapy, and I have no one in my life to talk to about it."
2508,"I don't want to see a therapist and be put on meds, not to mention I don't even have the money."
2509,"I am in therapy (twice a week for the passed 4 years), I cannot take anti-depressants due to a brain injury (I have tried, they have caused more issues)."
2510,I'm visiting a therapist when I can.
2511,I've decided to seek treatment again and I have a psychiatrist appointment in 6hrs and a therapy appointment on the third of August.
2512,"I'm already on medication and I've been in therapy, so those bases are covered."
2513,I finished my therapy with my psychiatrist 2 months ago.
2514,"She told me I could always contact her (e-mail, but I have this number and we used to text when I was in therapy."
2515,I'm counting down the days until I can start therapy.
2516,"I'll be seeing my therapist in a few days to help me sort out being triggered, but in the meantime I'm trying to be strong and take care of myself."
2517,"Quick facts: 

-I'm 23 and shes 22
-We've been together almost 2 months now
-I don't take medicine or see a therapist
-I actually have health anxiety as well so I'm scared of taking medicine for my anxiety because of what it might do to me."
2518,-For those that are going to just go with the easy response and suggest meds or therapists please tell me about your experiences with it so I'm not as anxious about them.
2519,"I saw a therapist in high school for it, who taught me some ways to cope with flashbacks/all the anger I was feeling."
2520,"I tried to tell my mom one day that I needed to see a therapist once I graduated, but she shut me down."
2521,I haven't seen a therapist since.
2522,"For a while I wanted to be a physical therapist, but when I job shadowed I found out I didn't like it."
2523,Maybe an art therapist?
2524,"I have been to family therapy as a kid and it was such a cluster fuck between my mom, step-dad, brother, and myself."
2525,Any stories or resources about therapy virgins?
2526,"I'm on multiple medications, but I've been out of therapy for about a year and a half- I'm going to get into a domestic violence therapy thing to start up again."
2527,"I am on meds (Effexor, Xanax as needed, both of them pretty low doses), and I do see a therapist."
2528,i then asked him if he had any recommendations for therapy and he said there's none that's reliable in my country.
2529,"I'm not ignoring the fact that I should go see a counsellor or a therapist, but it just doesn't seem as viable at the moment, and I guess ultimately, I'm trying to understand what's going on with me at the moment."
2530,Perhaps therapy might aid me...
2531,"I'm considering seeking out a therapist, assuming it's partially covered by my insurance...but I wanted to know if anyone had been through anything similar."
2532,"I have been thinking about going to therapy for a long time, but I've always been too afraid to call."
2533,"I know I need therapy, but I also know that it's going to probably be expensive."
2534,"Do I see a psychotherapist, a psychologist, or someone else?"
2535,"I did the first few pages of a ""procrastination workbook"" with one therapist, and it said I had every type of procrastination except doing it to spite people (I hate being an inconvenience)."
2536,"I haven't really talked to anyone about it besides my family/therapist, I just wanted to let a few strangers know."
2537,I'm testing a novel approach to exposure therapy designed to minimize or eliminate the sense of threat that is a basic part of modern exposure therapy.
2538,"After about a week of this, I decided to reach out to a family friend who works as a therapist."
2539,"He also referred me to therapists, but I stupidly have not contacted them yet."
2540,I started therapy a few weeks with my campus Counseling office.
2541,"I went into therapy for many years, was in the hospital for a week because I had a panic attack for three days (mother was harassing me I don't want to do into it), nothing changed and I only got worse."
2542,I (20 yr old female) first started therapy for depression when I was 13.
2543,"I'm going to see a therapist in a few days about both problems, but is there any advice you guys can give?"
2544,I recently lost my therapist due to insurance changes and I have only one in-network therapist with not-really great reviews.
2545,"For those who don't know what [this is](http://www.talkspace.com/), it's a text and video-based therapy service."
2546,"Take care of yourself, get into therapy, switch up your meds, etc, do YOU."""
2547,Both me and my boyfriend are in therapy.
2548,Obviously I'm seeing a therapist and psychiatrist and I have a great support system but I am still struggling.
2549,How long did it take you to lose the physical side effects and learn new coping mechanisms with a therapist?
2550,"I've been really considering seeing a therapist about my anxiety for awhile, but I'm uninsured and it's so expensive."
2551,I've been seeing a new therapist for a couple months now.
2552,"Talking to men tends to be stressful for me, but my old therapist (who was moving and was thus referring me elsewhere) thought it might be good for me to see a male, for that very reason (also, she didn't like anyone else in my insurance network)."
2553,Has anyone else had distracting sexual fantasies about their therapist?
2554,I've only been to a few meetings with my therapist so far and we have narrowed down my anxiety issues.
2555,She recognizes this issue and she's been saying for about 6 months now that she wants to see a therapist but has never actually sought out help before.
2556,I know medication and therapy should be long term solutions but what about short term?
2557,I was enrolled in therapy and it was AWFUL.
2558,But I'm still struggling and willing to give therapy another chance.
2559,"I'm Native American, so I get free healthcare, but unfortunately I can't see any other therapist but that one."
2560,"So, I've had anxiety for years and years now, but it has recently completely taken over my life and I am going to a therapist for the first time."
2561,"I've been to all manner of councillors, cbt, therapy and psychologists and found them reassuring but not too helpful; the most helpful was the last one,  a trainee psychologist who decided to just teach me how the anxiety and panic reactions work in the brain."
2562,I go to a therapist regularly and I'm waiting to see a doctor who can prescribe me something.
2563,Ive been unemployed for about a month while the meds side effects slowed down and am going to a therapist on the tenth.
2564,I put off seeking therapy for my self-doubt and anxiety for the longest time because I thought it was cost prohibitive.
2565,"Now, maybe three months into therapy, my bosses are considering changing our health plan, and our copay will be quadrupling."
2566,"I want to put my foot down and say I don't like the new plan, that we should stick with the regular one, but I'm the only person in the office who has this concern, and I feel uncomfortable having to tell the entire room that I'm in therapy."
2567,"At the same time, I decided it was too much burden to put only on myself, my mom, and my boyfriend, so I sought out a therapist."
2568,"I went in every other week to talk things through, and though the act of going to the therapist itself usually made my anxiety worse, he helped me to realize that I shouldn't be so hard on myself."
2569,I'm probably going to start cognitive therapy or whatever it's called in the future though.
2570,"after awhile of home-schooling, I dropped my other subjects and only started to do english and maths , which was fine because I said I was stressed and the therapists/child physiologists took it seriously so I just went with it."
2571,"I can't drive, so I can't see a therapist."
2572,"She's talked to therapists, been prescribed Xanax, had bloodwork done, even had a colonoscopy to see if the IBS was caused by something physiological."
2573,"Everything has come back normal so far, and therapy hasn't seemed to do much."
2574,My boyfriend got mad and said home therapies aren't good and to go to the doctor.
2575,"I would bring it up with my therapist, but she doesn't usually end up giving me advice I can use long term."
2576,"What I think would be best for me is to start seeing a therapist again, but my situation doesn't allow me to at the moment, so I'm looking for alternatives."
2577,"Is there, I don't know, some sort of homework you can do by yourself that can replace actual therapy for a time?"
2578,I'm in therapy and on light medication for the time being.
2579,"I don't know what to do, I haven't been to therapy in a month because of the holidays."
2580,"I have been struggling with mental health issues for years, and though I saw therapists as a teenager 5 years ago to work through some life events, I have never been diagnosed with anything such as depression or anxiety."
2581,I did see a family therapist about 10 years ago for unrelated issues to anxiety and at the conclusion of our sessions he told me I was afraid of being successful.
2582,"At first I thought it was my job, but now that it started again I think the therapist might have been right."
2583,I haven't been to therapy for a couple of years either so am wondering if it would help.
2584,"At the moment, I'm living in a foreign country (China) and while I can speak the language I have a few problems getting therapy here."
2585,"Secondly, there isn't too much in the way of therapy."
2586,"And yes I have a therapist, although most advice I've gotten so far is that I should try and make friends *now*, as most people are in the same boat and don't know anyone, the sooner you get to know them the better!"
2587,Have been going to therapy for around 2-3 months to try and cope and have started 20mg citalopram 6 days ago.
2588,IE: someone leaves me I get destructive (Think of when you leave your dog at home except I don't dig in the cushions or get in the trash) I go to both a therapist (she just tells me to pray to make it better.She also put me on wellburton (sp?)
2589,"I've never spoken to anyone but my husband &amp; therapists about this, and I've never written about it."
2590,My gp prescribed me Xanax and referred me to a therapist.
2591,"I saw the therapist regularly, to no avail."
2592,"I've seen a number of therapists, many of whom seem a little ill equipped with this specific issue."
2593,I've been seeing another therapist for the last 6 mos that I really like.
2594,"Aside from the standard therapy, etc., have you found any ways to cope and work through this kind of anxiety?"
2595,Does my therapist just suck?
2596,"Now, this is why I mentioned I had gone to a therapist for many a year."
2597,At therapy I learned mental tools and thought patterns to stop my anxiety and reason out false positive worries.
2598,I would like to find a way to not be on medicine but therapy is expensive and the only therapist I've had a good experience with charges $200 per session.
2599,I've been in therapy for anxiety before.
2600,"I don't see my therapist until the 2nd, and I JUST started my medication (ambilify) for PTSD + BP + Anxiety (I was on meds for this but took myself off)."
2601,"I am in therapy, its feeling therapy or primal therapy."
2602,My therapist was shocked to learn that I admitted I was having a severe panic attack in her office but she couldnt the reality was I finally felt safe enough as a old man to admit the terror I feel on the inside.
2603,"This job will involve traveling to new places and cities which I am not fond of, I just want to be able to do my job with no worries and not throw a panic attack, I used to be so laid back and I would have never guessed I could have panic attacks, I want to be like that again, my doctors and therapist aren't doing much for me."
2604,Because all of the therapy work I've been trying to do toward that end has not been successful.
2605,"I guess this is really something to talk to my therapist about, but I needed to vent a little."
2606,"My therapist has recommended physiatrists but I cant see them for a month, and has also advised I stop smoking, as it seems to exacerbate my anxiety."
2607,"I'm broke and can't affort a therapist of any sorts, I'm frustrated and I just want to stop thinking about all of it."
2608,My family physician doesn't want to be my de facto therapist because that's not her field of expertise.
2609,"But I never really opened up to doctors or therapists, and got very good at portraying myself as outwardly fine."
2610,This response of anxiety is hardwired in your brain so that's maybe why the cognitive therapy thing (I forgot the correct name) is so effective because you put yourself through stressful situations and learn along with a therapist that you no longer live in an ancient tribe where you could die by fucking up one more time.
2611,Recently a therapist I've been seeing has suggested that I may have anxiety issues.
2612,"Whether its a therapist or a friend, just find SOMEONE who will listen."
2613,"I have an idea of what I should do, that being putting myself in more social situation, like an exposure therapy."
2614,Got a therapist who specializes in CBT to help teach me techniques I can use to fall back asleep.
2615,"I've met with a career counselor a few times, and hope to start seeing a therapist soon to sort out my anxiety and fear of responsibility."
2616,Is talk therapy the right treatment?
2617,"My therapist has chosen Internal Family Systems (IFS) as a way to work through my anxiety, but I have doubts about it since every book, etc."
2618,Has anybody used this method with a therapist?
2619,"I also got a referral to a therapist that specializes in CBT at my request, I really want to finally address my problems and do everything I can to fix them."
2620,I live in a country where if you go to a therapist you're considered a psychopath so I can't really go.
2621,"Since the age of 15, I've seen countless therapists and psychiatrists."
2622,"Finally, through all of the heart issues, I found a great therapist.I have been seeing her for almost two years now."
2623,"I practice yoga almost everyday (which has been a huge stress relief) and adopted a vegan lifestyle a year ago, I still see my therapist, but don't need to as often as I used to, and I still take medication: Klonopin .625 mg a day."
2624,"I have been to 8 therapists/psychologists before i was 21, They taught me CBT, and calming down techniques but never helped me get to the root of this thing."
2625,Ive seen 4 different therapists in the last 6 years.
2626,I haven't seen my last therapist in over 3 months and my file with them has been discarded (according to a letter I received last week) so I don't have anyone to ask for a referral.
2627,I'd rather not see a therapist or take medicine.
2628,I am looking into cognitive behavioral therapy but I don't have insurance so I don't know if that is even something viable.
2629,"A friend of mine has social anxiety (she is seeing a therapist as far as I know, and on medication) though she's been blocking out all of her friends, including me."
2630,"Or maybe even cognitive behavioural therapy, because my issues are bound to be deep engrained into me."
2631,"I'm seeing a doctor on Friday about my pain and I'm going to a therapist for the first time on Tuesday for my anxiety, but I would love to sleep tonight and maybe even write my paper that's due in the morning."
2632,"I already have been seeing a therapist for 4 months of CBT but I feel like nothing has improved and honestly, I feel slightly worse."
2633,My therapist has been great and I really work at the things we discuss in therapy but it seems to not be enough.
2634,"After much mental anguish, and month of trying to convince myself there was no problem, I finally got a therapist."
2635,Because of my fear I was not even able to tolerate having my therapy sessions indoors (there was a sushi restaurant in the same plaza).
2636,My therapist was able to teach me some techniques to help me calm down and manage my fear day to day.
2637,I don't really know where to start looking for a therapist - I saw one a while back but we didn't connect extremely well.
2638,"I've been to a therapist for months and Susan was the best, she did her best to re-assure me but again, she isn't a doctor."
2639,I'd like to get the ball rolling before therapy starts so I can familiarize myself with the core concepts and really dig into my brain.
2640,"I've seen multiple therapists, and have worked extensively on ""things"" in general with them, and while they've been helpful, writing is still a big problem."
2641,What sort of therapist do I talk to?
2642,We are taking steps (he got a Rx for meds - something we've talked about for awhile) and we're revisiting therapy.
2643,"I'm worried it's just going to keep compounding if I don't do something about it, but cannot afford therapy and want absolutely nothing to do with medication."
2644,"Recently, I feel like my head is going to explode, I have no idea how to approach this, my therapist is still on vacation."
2645,"Swirling around me are the pieces of a puzzle: yoga, meditation, go back on SSRIs, mindfulness, diet, exersize,  herbs, re-visit thyroid therapy, etc.."
2646,"I shared some of the difficulties I had with my counselor and group therapy, but I've decided to put that behind me and move on to find people who want to actually help me."
2647,"I'm between therapists (I just moved and my old one is now 3 hours away, each way...new clinic can't see me until beginning of January) so any advice here is welcome."
2648,I am waiting to resume therapy but the wait might take few more weeks.
2649,I started going to a psychotherapist but I didn't get any help from her.
2650,I think I should see a therapist but generally speaking I don't know how to cope.
2651,"I wont go to a therapist i refuse to cause I cant, theres no way I can open up to them but I can anonymously to a bunch of random strangers on the internet."
2652,I currently see a therapist once a week and have a doctor to help with medication.
2653,I know I need therapy but I'm in the middle of my finals week now and I have a huge presentation due today.
2654,I was scared about how it would go; I've never really done talk therapy before.
2655,Is this a normal post-therapy reaction?
2656,I can't afford to go to a therapist about it.
2657,"I hadn't actually vomited since I was very young, but I was always terrified of it, until I got therapy and overcame my anxiety."
2658,"I don't know what to do anymore, I know I need to go back to therapy but I'm not sure how much it'll help, and I'm just sick of being scared all the time."
2659,"I talked to my physician and therapist about this, but they were both unconcerned and said I would adjust which I did."
2660,So I just had an intake interview for the day-therapy I might going to follow.
2661,"I have to switch therapists... ( the one I am with now does not do group-therapy, so I have to switch companies)  

I love my psych right now."
2662,I do not want to give her up for some group-therapy thing... what if they hate me?
2663,"had to quit school cause it went sucky) I just don't know

my options; 

- stay with my therapist
- leave my therapist and start the group therapy
- stay with my therapist and figure something out with home-care stuff ( that they help organizing your home and budget and stuff)  and work with that
- leave my therapist and start at the other therapist and do day-care stuff and work with that 

GOD!"
2664,"This is long, partial rant, partial just explaining what I'm going through because reading some of your stories I don't think I'm that bad off, but then again, I can't take it anymore - 

I know I need to see someone, however reading up on the therapy types, I become extremely critical and dismissive, and also feel combative about what I'll be asked in therapy, and automatically have negative thoughts about rejecting it."
2665,"I've gone to therapy before and it kind of helped some, but I quit when I left to go to college."
2666,Never seen a therapist.
2667,My girlfriend wants me to see a therapist as my thought process is affecting our relationship.
2668,I will go to a therapist.
2669,I need to see a therapist.
2670,Stopped CBT at 21 because therapist said I was pretty okay/have the tools to curb the anxiety issues/insurance ran out.
2671,Not currently on any medications and have been on a waiting list for a publicly funded therapist for 8 weeks now.
2672,Wondering if any of you have any advice on how to overcome these feelings without therapy/medication as I am still waiting to get into therapy.
2673,"(I cannot afford private therapy, my insurance does not cover mental health.)"
2674,I got really lucky with a therapist I liked right away.
2675,"My therapist says that when I have that feeling, to let it pass and do something else, but I feel like I'm running away from my problem."
2676,I don't have another therapy appointment for 2 weeks.
2677,So I haven't seen my therapist in almost 3 weeks and I'm really anxious about seeing her tomorrow..
2678,"I'm not sure what to do, all of the therapists I've called can't take on any new patients."
2679,I never sought help until earlier this year and was offered therapy which I took.
2680,I've been through therapy.
2681,She was really supportive and helped get me into therapy.
2682,I probably need to reevaluate my medication and go back to therapy if I found a new guy.
2683,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a little girl; I remember having random phobias come and go when I was a child, I was depressed in middle and high school and diagnosed with depression and GAD in high school, on and off of Lexapro and therapy through various stages of my life."
2684,"Seeing a therapist for that, exercising regularly, generally taking care of himself probably even better than I am lol."
2685,Right now I am continuing my therapy and it is a slow process.
2686,To maybe give to my therapists or friends so they can understand.
2687,"I do see a therapist who isn't that helpful, she mostly just listens to see what *I've* figured out."
2688,She's my fourth therapist in two years.
2689,"I've tried therapy, but I didn't have much confidence in my therapist."
2690,I get the feeling a good therapist should be able to sit through a full hour whilst I'm feeling okay and do what we can to make sure I stay that way.
2691,Don't have money or time to find a decent therapist.
2692,"Yes, I have been to the doctors, before we start - I went yesterday, he said he didn't want to prescribe me pills and I'm booked in for therapy on the 18th december, but it's so far away and I just feel awful now."
2693,"I dont know if i should go to a doctor or therapist, if i need meducation or just someone to talk this out with."
2694,I've been able to pull myself together so far but I worry that these anxiety attacks will get worse and that I should seek therapy.
2695,"I have tried various therapies, and am currently not seeing anyone, although I am switching my medication from Effexor(187.5mg) to Celexa(10mg) and it seems to have no effect on my anxiety."
2696,"Getting therapy, start mediating, exercise , improve social skills and get friends, find a career path , take up hobbies."
2697,"I'm considering starting therapy, mainly because I will (hopefully) be starting university next year and I don't want to have my life there dictated by anxiety as it is now, or to be having panic attacks around total strangers."
2698,"I'm currently slightly terrified about making the move to start therapy, so I'd like to know of anyone here has a positive experience they'd like to share on how it has helped them."
2699,"I AM on medications and go to therapy, but those only help so much."
2700,I want to see a therapist and I really do not want to take medication.
2701,What can expect from a therapist?
2702,"so back to square one
I need a therapist, I have searching since Dec."
2703,So I can't get a therapist.
2704,I have a therapist who I've only had 4 sessions with this far.
2705,"I have yet to feel any better after therapy but like I said, I've only seen her for a short duration."
2706,I want to see a psychiatrist who specializes in psychotherapy along with medication but I don't even know where to begin to look and I'm not good at talking about my feelings so I know it will be tough.
2707,"Oh, and she referred me to a therapist...my first appointment with her is in a few weeks."
2708,I was agoraphobic at the time and after talking too a bunch of therapists with different titles they sent me to the hospital for testing.
2709,My occupational therapist quit on me.
2710,I want to get therapy done because there's someone who does EDMR therapy here.
2711,But I can not fucking trust therapists anymore because I'm actually traumatized *from* therapy in the first place.
2712,tl;dr: I'm trauamtized from therapy.
2713,I want to see a new therapist but I can not work up enough courage.
2714,How do I trust therapists again after they literally caused me to get PTSD and be in a situation where I was almost assaulted and had to suffer a lot of abuse.
2715,The worst part of all this is that the only person who I can really talk to about my frustrations living with Mom without fear of it getting back to her is my therapist.
2716,"Unsurprisingly, I've started seeing my therapist at more frequent intervals."
2717,I hope the therapist can help explain how difficult my situation is for me already and how what she is doing is not helping.
2718,"Being told to have something done by a certain time or to go somewhere on a certain day at a certain time is the worst sort of thing that can happen to me -- having to be at school by a certain time; having a project deadline; an appointment with my therapist; hell, even having to meet a friend somewhere makes me anxious."
2719,I've trying to find a good therapist as well.
2720,Apparently he will decide if I need therapy or meds.
2721,"I have a therapist, but I don't think my anxiety/depression is something that is going to be solved by positive thinking."
2722,I tried therapy but it did not work.
2723,"I am currently in a psychiatric private hospital getting treated for my anxiety, depression and personality disorder with therapy and medication and my girlfriend came to visit tonight."
2724,"She regularly sees a therapist every 2 weeks, and she is medicated with Bupropion and Buspirone."
2725,I just met with a new therapist and he brought it up as a method we might try.
2726,i am desperate to have CBT however (iam in the UK) the doctor said that services are too stretched to help me and offered me medication (sertraline) to stabalise me until therapy becomes available.
2727,"So, last week I had a spike in my anxiety and OCD out of nowhere, and since then, I've seen a therapist, who's going to start CBT with me next week, and also referred me to a psychiatrist as well."
2728,"Also, I'm hoping the CBT my therapist is starting next week will help, she said she's gonna teach me a breathing exercise, but I have a feeling that CBT alone isn't going to be enough, and that I need some medication to really cope."
2729,"I'm also supposed to see my regular physician to get some blood tests done, and my therapist agrees that I should ask for some anxiety meds to help in the mean time, while I wait to see a psychiatrist, but I can't even get in to see my doctor, until next Thursday."
2730,I'm posting this here until I can see a therapist.
2731,Finally got around to visiting a therapist for my anxiety and I was prescribed these two.
2732,Tomorrow I’m going to type out some emails at therapy so if I have a panic attack I’ll have support.
2733,I was seeing a therapist about this at my University.
2734,I can't have any long term therapy because I am studying abroad in a few weeks.
2735,"The University therapist told me that If I wrote things down, did breathing exercises, tried to deal with it instead of covering it up and realized that I wont always feel this way, that over time it will slowly get better and better."
2736,"At the very least, I should talk to a therapist."
2737,After therapy ive been good but its been coming back.
2738,So I recently started a new anti-depressant because things have been bad since September (with a break up and one of my friends killing herself) and my usual diet + exercise + therapy wasn't enough to control my anxiety.
2739,"I have therapy on Wednesday for the first time in 3 weeks, thank goodness, but I have a 6 hour shift today of more training and an 8 hour shift tomorrow where I'm on the register all day."
2740,"I see a therapist for CBT every other week, and my panic attacks are now rare and fairly easy for me to control."
2741,"We are seeing a couples therapist once a week, but I don't know how much progress we're making."
2742,"I stopped seeing a therapist after about six months, and stopped the medication then as I felt I was cheating, or not trying hard enough to deal with my problems without medicine."
2743,"It's been over 5 years since then, and after doing some soul searching and reading I've realized I need to deal with my anxiety with a therapist and possibly medication."
2744,"Through my uni they offered me to see a hypnotherapist, which I was very skeptical about at first, but have found it to be really helpful!"
2745,"When I am under, the hypnotherapist talks me through situations, says different mantras and explains things to me, which at the time I can kind of concentrate on, but is mostly getting through to my sub conscious."
2746,"Obviously I can't tell you how much of it is the hypnotherapy, or the meds, but day to day life is so much easier now and I feel so much calmer, so I am able to tackle uncomfortable situations."
2747,tl;dr had hypnotherapy after six months of panic attacks - think it's really helped!
2748,"I've been desperately trying to get help and get on some anxiety meds but I'm on a 3 month waiting list for the psychiatrist, and I've called a few therapists and all are atleast a 1 month waiting list!"
2749,"I've tried therapy and medicine, but nothing helps."
2750,"Trying to make a long story short, but I have been through everything possible when it comes to anxiety and have tried everything I could to help it (therapy, medication, meditation, reflexology, reike, homeopathy, chiropractic specialist, hypno therapy, breathing techniques etc)."
2751,I can't stand having this problem and I am wondering if therapy/ medicine can help.
2752,Go to a therapist.
2753,"He said he doesn't care if I repeatedly skip appointments with him or reschedule a billion times, he wants me at a therapist as soon as possible."
2754,"The next day, I looked up a few therapists in my area."
2755,"And it's not like I've never been to therapist before, I've had two (the first one was pretty terrible, the second one was okay but she moved away)."
2756,I want to see a therapist.
2757,I asked the therapist and certain staff members how this could be done and they all said that I could sign a 72 hour discharge notice since I admitted myself.
2758,"The therapist told me that at the meetings, they mentioned that I wasn't eating, bathing, or sleeping, which gave them a reason to keep me in the facility."
2759,We had a family meeting with the therapist and the psychiatrist.
2760,"I've tried getting therapy, tried medication for a while, but some rocks came along in the road and those things had to stop for a while."
2761,My therapist(who I also just started seeing) has set me a homework assignment of making a resume which will be a huge help if I can just get it done.
2762,Edit: Well I came home from therapy to reddit appearing to already end their blackout.
2763,"I have both (diagnosed with social phobia and have been going to therapists since I was a kid for trust issues and emotional detachment) so I took these things quite seriously and was eager to help, while keeping him unaware that I have these issues as I don't like to tell people I have them."
2764,"I am considering starting psychotherapy, but it will cost me around $50/session with my insurance."
2765,"I've been at this for decades, have taken 9 different meds, seen unknown numbers of doctors, tried all the non-drug therapies I could get myself to try, CBT, ACT, mindfulness, yoga, meditation."
2766,"I reached the point with my old doctor, a psychiatrist, where we weren't making any progress over about two years, and he wanted to continue to give me the same types of drugs, do little or no actual psychotherapy (though I paid for it), and I figured that was plenty."
2767,"I did an inventory of all the drugs, techniques, therapies, books and DVDs I've bought, and it's depressing what I've put myself through and still have no answers."
2768,"I have seen counsellors, therapists, psychologists, occupational therapists and psychiatrists."
2769,TL;DR: having a really rough time with anxiety and need some coping strategies until I can begin therapy again.
2770,"As said in some earlier posts, I'm picking up swimming, yoga and sticking to my therapy."
2771,I've been in therapy for my anxiety since early summer.
2772,I started seeing my therapist when I quit drinking.
2773,The more science/therapy based the better.
2774,How do I find a good therapist to help me get a grip on my reality and my anxiety?
2775,"I must have horrible luck with therapists, because in the past, therapy has made me feel crazier and more anxious."
2776,"I had a really normal childhood, and I feel like therapists have never helped me with what is happening presently in my life."
2777,Anyone have a great therapist they love.
2778,I've talked to my therapist about it multiple times because my panic attacks/anxiety usually hit right when I'm going to bed or waking up.
2779,The handful of therapists I've seen in the last year see that I've held down a job and aren't threatening suicide so they sit on their hands and don't do shit.
2780,"Long story short, the hospital just consisted of docs taking 12 weeks to find out ""Which Personality Disorder she has"" (gee thanks), barely any real therapy, just arts and crafts - and the Meds not working, in fact, making my spells of crying and self-loathing and intense fear of the future much worse."
2781,I realized I need to try meds again in addition to therapy by last October.
2782,"To get this extension, they need statements from your psych docs and therapist."
2783,"I have been seeking help, my doctors just suck and I can't afford therapy so I'm stuck with what I've got."
2784,It felt more like therapy and I didn't feel like I got any answers out of it.
2785,however i'm seeing the therapist at the uni on friday so i hope that helps a bit.
2786,After a year of therapy and warring with my anxieties I've developed a few tricks.
2787,I have a psychiatrist/therapist.
2788,How will talk therapy (and only talk therapy) cure me of this?
2789,"In the past few months I've been trying different treatments, from brief strategic therapy, hypnotherapy, to lexapro but nothing seems to have helped massively."
2790,I've talked to my therapist about it and he is very so so about giving it to a 17 year old as he isn't sure of what would happen based on the fact that the medication is tested on adults and not teenagers or children.
2791,"Anyway, you're required to see a therapist."
2792,"He treats me better than anyone have ever done, and I also attent therapy once a week since january 2015, but my life has never felt more useless."
2793,"Also, during therapy I've more and more started to understand my own flaws."
2794,"My therapist said it can help anyway, though, so I'm willing to try it."
2795,"I get 4 free therapy appointments through work, so I went to them."
2796,I went back and told the therapist about it on my 4th and final session with her.
2797,"I looked it up online, and I am just not sold on the idea of group therapy."
2798,"I also need to find a new therapist-- while she was helpful, I heard a little bit too much about giving myself over to God and accepting a higher being."
2799,"What have been your experiences, and am I judging group therapy too harshly?"
2800,"No medication has worked and we have never found the ""right"" therapist."
2801,"I've seen a therapist and will see her today as well, and I'll be transferred to her psychiatrist in a week or two and she will have authority over my medication."
2802,"I've been to therapy, have drugs (didn't want to take Ativan because I was driving)."
2803,And has a therapy session booked for later this month (that was the soonest he could get an appointment).
2804,I've been in therapy and I'm making some progress.
2805,"I feel like with therapy I can overcome my older, more long-standing issues, but now I have this brand new thing where I wake up at 4 in the morning and panic for no fucking reason, or for the littlest possible reason."
2806,"I don't want to blame anyone, but in a way, I feel wronged, like someone should have led me toward therapy first and meds should have waited."
2807,So I have to get a different therapist cause I'll be switching health insurance.
2808,I have only ever seen 1 therapist off and on for over ten years.
2809,I don't even know where to begin looking for a new therapist.
2810,My therapist says it will but I'm not convinced.
2811,"Everyone says that I should get therapy but as noted above, my experience wasn't that great."
2812,Can someone please explain to me how therapy can be helpful when they can't give you any tangible tools to get over what I feel?
2813,I'm going to see if my psychiatrist can recommend a therapist to work through some of these issues.
2814,"This may sound bad, but I don't want to hear about a mother and daughter duo from Wisconsin that is going through chemotherapy together."
2815,I have been on hormone replacement therapy (hrt) for three months and it is not going well.
2816,I've gotten therapy and about two months ago started on Zoloft because my anxiety has increased a lot.
2817,I was already in therapy due to past history of depression before I went to work there.
2818,It was my therapist who had suggested to take breaks.
2819,I have not told my therapist how out of hand this had gotten.
2820,I however tell my therapist I am doing that.
2821,"Even my aunt, who is a therapist (not mine obviously), seems to feel I just need to 'keep working hard'."
2822,I am seeing my therapist on Thursday and part of me wants to just admit the whole thing.
2823,She kept telling me all of those things my therapist would have been telling me.
2824,"I read online about exposure therapy, per se, where you actively try to make the thing you're afraid of happen."
2825,"In october I started seeing a CBT therapist and after a couple of months stepping down with the meds, I today decided to stop with them."
2826,"My therapist and I talks about applying a ""third-party observer"" that indicates when the anxiety strikes me."
2827,"Eventually in 2012, I began going to therapy, and most of my issues were solved after about 9 months of speaking to psychologists."
2828,I finally got a PCP and have spoken to her about it and she will be seeking me a therapist and spoke about anxiety medication.
2829,I really needed to just let it out somewhere before I tell a therapist.
2830,"I have muscle-spasms (sort of muscle-nodes or something) for which I get to physio therapy every week, but that is like &gt;10y old thing, not sure if it's related at all.."
2831,"I started a therapy and have a second meeting with my doctor for medication in a week, but I highly doubt I'll ever be fine again, or that I'll ever get excited, or get attached to anything, because I know it will be gone."
2832,"I should add that I also plan on going through cognitive behavioral therapy, but I want a short term solution in the mean time to help me cope with these random anxiety/panic attacks and get my body under control."
2833,"Since then I've felt like I could, for the most part, keep my anxiety at a decent level by myself and with therapy."
2834,"I don't quite know what the protocol is here regarding therapy or counselling, and it occurred to me that there may be somewhere online I could talk to someone."
2835,"I can't see a therapist or doctor because I think Canadians need help before I do as I'm an immigrant here, I don't want to go to a therapist of doctor complaining of anxiety when there are people that need real help."
2836,also opinions on cognitive behavioral therapy which has been suggested.
2837,I'm not 100% cured but there is a clear way to get over this nasty thing without meds and therapy.
2838,Thanks to the social anxiety I've never really gotten good at conversation (I'm practising now with my therapist) so some suggestions on first date conversation topics (and things to avoid) would be awesome.
2839,"Back home I was seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, and started back on Lexapro (despite having had no success with it in the past) in March."
2840,"In the ensuing anger, I cancel my last appointment with the therapist and stop taking the Lexapro, which I was convinced did nothing to help my anxiety."
2841,"Also, I've never liked the therapy portions of treatment, and I'd rather just try medication, and I know anyone I go to will recommend therapy in conjunction with medication."
2842,I just want to see a doctor or a therapist and get things sorted out.
2843,"I have anxiety and I'm pretty sure I'm depressed too, are therapists worth going to for help?"
2844,I worked with a therapist for 12 sessions.
2845,"I would continue with a therapist, but my insurance only covers so many sessions a year and I can't return until it's been a year since I last started."
2846,"It's got to the point that he feels like my therapist, and I feel like I should just walk away because neither of us are getting what we need from the relationship - but I know if I do, I'm walking out on something that without my anxiety could be really amazing."
2847,Is it worth it to go through CBT and therapies?
2848,"My wife has GAD, and last fall picked a therapist based on her gut feeling."
2849,"It went sour, with no real gains after several months, and plenty of moments that have caused other therapists to comment on her lack of professionalism."
2850,"This was a huge setback, and it took about 5 months of carefully evaluating and analyzing multiple therapists before she started with a new therapist."
2851,"Now, a month into it, my wife is again starting to have some of the same feelings, where she feels the therapist isn't really trying to help her."
2852,"It was my understanding that a therapist would generally be a positive experience, and start the road to recovery."
2853,"I have no money to seek therapy or a doctor, so all I can rely on is this."
2854,I have recently decided to go down the CBT road with my psychologist and I was interested in picking up a workbook to use simultaneously with the therapy.
2855,"My doctor also mentioned that as I'm AWARE that these neuroses are not logical, therapy may not be the best solution in some cases."
2856,What I've heard around is that I should see a therapist to try and get to the root of my anxiety but I don't feel like that would really help.
2857,I've tried therapy before and due to the nature of my anxiety (over-thinking and over-analysing) the therapist couldn't really tell me anything I didn't already know.
2858,"I guess what I'm saying is, I don't feel like a therapist could possibly give me some magic coping mechanism that will be able to force me to ignore my anxieties and continue whatever I need to do in my life."
2859,"Medication could possibly be another option but seeing a doctor and having to describe my symptoms scares me, they might just try to make me see a therapist again... 

Any replies would really be appreciated."
2860,I have my second therapist appointment tomorrow.
2861,Called my therapist to put in a refill and she said she can't over the phone.
2862,"I am in therapy for my ADD and depression, I got Concerta ( 36mg) to help me with that, but I think the main problem is Anxiety."
2863,"I've been seeing a therapist for about two months now and he hasn't recommended that I try medication yet, and I was hesitant to go that route for a long time but I'm just sick of this."
2864,My doctor says I need to see a therapist before I see a psychiatrist and that in Florida if you are a minor you can not see a psychiatrist first?
2865,"I started experimenting with a lot of different pills and ended up taking a liking to a pure form of synthetic pot which eventually led to psychosis and psychiatric hospitalization (was on zoloft at the time aswell)

Flash foward I'm a junior in college, pharm and therapy free, pretty much began treating my anxiety with pot by taking hits throughout the day."
2866,"Talk therapy hasnt worked, no matter how.many times I've cried over what my family put through (they are pretty sure there is more I just dont remember) i still cannot get passed it even when I forget about it for months, it comes back."
2867,They believe the EMDR therapy will really be a break through for me.
2868,"Cognitive-behavioural therapy actually worked, and it was the hardest thing I have ever gone through (yup, probably worse than what brought on this disorder in the first place)."
2869,I did this therapy for more than a year and ended up with almost no attacks and a good group of friends; unfortunately I let a 'toxic' person back into my life and he triggered everything again so now I'm back to the start.
2870,I was wondering if anybody else has tried Cognitive-behavioural therapy or there is something else out there that I haven't thought of trying?
2871,In my therapy session yesterday I ended talking about how a big part of my anxiety was not knowing what I was going to do in the future.
2872,My therapist suggesting social work since one of the things I am rather good at and enjoy is helping people (well people who aren't me!).
2873,"eventually, i got put on meds, and I'm thinking of increasing my dose once i see my therapist."
2874,I've been in therapy for months.
2875,"At that time, my mom was obviously still in control of my medical affairs, so she recommended that I opt out of any medication and seek natural remedies and/or therapy."
2876,"The at-home therapies (breathing exercise, meditation, yoga, etc) were starting to help less and less."
2877,"No sorts of therapy or medication are of any help whatsoever, aside from the benzos every now and then and only for a few minutes after they've kicked in."
2878,"Luckily, I have a weekly meeting with a therapist and it happened to be today in the morning."
2879,"I am [a therapist in Oregon](http://www.hoperisingbend.com/), and will be incorporating the information you shared into some of my clients homework."
2880,"I'm seeing a therapist, but I've only had one meeting."
2881,I am in therapy and on medication.
2882,"I struggle against my fear of doctors to get therapy, which is helping me  to 'grow up' and 'get over it.'"
2883,"I've talked with my therapist about these things, and she agrees with this conclusion."
2884,"And its not like I want them to be my therapist or something, just chats."
2885,"I am currently seeing a therapist, but I seem to be able to keep it together for other people and my therapist to the point that it seems as if my anxiety isn't a problem and that I'm dealing with it well."
2886,All the therapists work under him and love him.
2887,So supposedly over summer break I was supposed to be on a therapy plan to work on cognitive behavior and therapy.
2888,I've struggled with depression a bit and brought myself out of that using cognitive behavioral therapy.
2889,"I have recently started to undergo treatment/therapy to help solve this and prevent it from ruining my life further, but things have started to really go wrong with my gf."
2890,Seeing a therapist right now isn't in my means either since this baby is costing me a small fortune in medical bills.
2891,My therapist suggested I meet with a doctor to start something but the soonest I can get in to see her is the end of July.
2892,"Also, I work with autistic kids providing ABA therapy."
2893,"I keep thinking about seeing a therapist, but to be honest the task of finding one through my insurance seems so daunting of a task, and I wouldn't really know where to begin, or how to approach explaining to the people close to me why I think this is something I may need."
2894,My therapist wants me to try and be more assertive but it feels like the hardest possible thing I can imagine.
2895,I feel worse because when I see my therapist next I am going to tell her I chickened out :(
2896,"I don't know if I should see a therapist or a doctor or what, but I do think this sub will at least help me realize that I'm not alone."
2897,"Thanks to a lot of therapy, I am able to manage my thoughts and keep the feelings of anxiety at bay, but I am confused why I am still getting all the physical symptoms."
2898,"One of my old therapists told me, ""Keep pushing yourself to do something fearful every day."""
2899,Sometimes I feel like therapists just don't understand.
2900,"I don't know if I'll get any good answers since these problems probably take therapy and lots of time to solve, but any help/advice is appreciated."
2901,I am in therapy and I was in several professional mental health institutes just to find out what the fuck is wrong with me.
2902,"Everything about the place made me extremely nervous at first - the people (there was a woman that approached me that was talking using hand puppets and I felt terrible because I couldn't reply to her because I was so terrified of everything), the therapists/doctors walking around, the new environment itself."
2903,The psychologist says he feels like they can really help me and my first appointment with a therapist is next weekend.
2904,I want to start therapy but it's expensive and I don't know how to choose a good therapist (I also don't have much money for trial and error).
2905,I tried **traditional psychotherapy** for years.
2906,I suppose this is why anxious people literally can spend decades in traditional psychotherapy.
2907,I am currently seeking help by visiting a behavioural therapist every 2 weeks which I really enjoy and since have seem some improvements.
2908,"I'm kind of worried because last time I went to a therapist I was too afraid to tell her that I was trying to stop self-harming (my parents didn't know, they just thought I had anxiety alone)."
2909,Eventually I told my mom I wanted to quit because I didn't like my therapist and she agreed.
2910,"I'm kind of worried that the new therapist will try to convince me to go on meds like the other one did, but I'm better at communicating now than I was when I was a kid so I don't think she will do that."
2911,"I'm also going to make sure I tell her everything so she can actually help me, unlike with the other therapist."
2912,"Annnnnyway, does anyone on here have advice/stories about therapy?"
2913,"(currently on klonopin; last therapy session was Wednesday; next pscy appointment is May 8)

I just keep feeling like I'm going to die."
2914,My therapist says that's just anxiety in a nutshell but I think it's more complicated than that.
2915,My one friend who I'm currently staying with would probably think I'm just making this all up to get sympathy b/c he wants me to move out and my other friends wouldn't understand at all b/c I don't let many people know that I'm in therapy IRL.
2916,I was on meds that I liked and starting seeing a therapist a little under a month ago.
2917,I also have to get a new therapist and doctor.
2918,"I need to start therapy again (for anxiety, among other things) and have found a therapist I think I might be able to work with."
2919,"I don't know what to expect in terms of interviewing the therapist (I realize this is a highly personalized thing, I'm not seeking advice about specific questions to ask)."
2920,"I've only been in therapy once before, and we took care of the 'interview' portion during the first visit (I mostly word vomited for that)."
2921,"I've been working hard on trying to learn to be more social because of this, and started attending therapy last fall."
2922,"I just signed up for new insurance, and will start seeing my therapist again soon (I can only afford once a month now, though, instead of once a week like I was), so I'm read to fight this thing head on."
2923,"I've tried to get therapy, but I'm refused home visits by the NHS and find it gut-wrenchingly difficult to go and see someone, waiting rooms are a real nightmare for me."
2924,"I quit smoking, told my parents about the smoking habits, the anxiety problems and they are now looking for a therapist."
2925,"No news on when the therapist will be found, so I'm looking for comfort in the meantime."
2926,I've considered cognitive behavioral therapy but that scares me just thinking about it.
2927,"I have seen a couple therapists, and I don't know if they just weren't the right ones for me, or what, but they did not seem to understand or be able to relate to this existential crisis, per se."
2928,"I have access to therapy through my university and plan on taking advantage of it, but it won't start until August."
2929,I know I need to see a therapist or something.
2930,"I am an adult, 25 years old, but I have very little money and would have to go through insurance or ask her for money to see a therapist and I just can't bring myself to do it."
2931,I'm planning to get referred to a therapist as well.
2932,"I haven't been to therapy in a while, because I've been doing so good."
2933,"I'm thinking about going to see mental health services offered on campus, but I have never considered therapy before and the thought makes me feel weak as a person just beginning his adult life."
2934,"as she still hasn't really found a way to deal with her condition (no meds, and currently no therapy - she has tried a couple of therapists but they weren't the ""right fit"")."
2935,"It was always something that troubled me as I had a sense that I was doing it to a point where it was pathological, but none of my counsellors or therapists could offer any useful advice."
2936,"And because the only proof I really have is my therapy bills and panic attacks, I worry that I can't be helped at all/will never get an on-campus job again."
2937,I'm going to email my old therapist tomorrow and ask for advice as well.
2938,I have been to a speech therapist and I have been diagnosed with a speech disorder.
2939,"I told my therapist about my troubles sleeping, she of course told me mom."
2940,I have an appointment with a therapist tomorrow afternoon that my parents allowed me to set up (only because the insurance would pay for it).
2941,I wish I had never stopped going to therapy.
2942,"I was grumpy that my therapist was pregnant, which means she was just going to leave me, so what was the point in talking to her?"
2943,"I had been told by a group therapist to absolutely, under no circumstances, work outside of home for awhile."
2944,"She wanted me to focus on therapy, getting well, etc."
2945,I've gotten insurance and started therapy.
2946,The first therapist I found was AWFUL.
2947,"I don't have my diagnosis yet from my new therapist, since I haven't even seen her yet."
2948,"(The therapist I'm dropping is no help with this whatsoever - she's literally told me to just ""not think about things"" to avoid my flashbacks, and she rolled her eyes when I told her I was suicidal.)"
2949,"I have seen a number of professionals (therapists, psychiatrists, etc) and none of them seem willing to say straight up ""you have anxiety."""
2950,"Looking forward to your thoughts and experience on this... 

Just wanted to add, I have tried:

Depression meds

Bipolar meds

ADD (just vyvanse)

CBT and/or DBT (works a little bit)

Exercise (it helps some, but only temporarily)

Vedic meditation (helps a little, but is very time consuming - 40 minutes a day)

Psychotherapy"

2952,"Hi, I haven't browsed this subreddit too much yet but I'm sort of having a bad moment right now and I haven't been to therapy in months."
2953,"I faild at that and I have failed at life and all I want to do is kill myself , but I would probably fail at that to because im a coward im getting therapy and im on mood stabalizer pills but I stopped taking all my meds in hopes that I have a serious break down and just get shot by the cops."
2954,"Of course I would do things the correct way, discuss it with my doctor, start seeing my therapist again, alerting my family and friends that they might see changes in my behavior."
2955,I was working with a fantastic therapist at the time who suggested I may need medication because all the work we were doing together wasn't helping my anxiety.
2956,I've been seeing a therapist so I have some tools to try to rein this in but nothing seems to be working right now.
2957,(note: I'm not able to see a therapist at the moment)
2958,"I was just wondering, how have you guys found that the drugs and the therapy have worked out for you?"
2959,"Doctor referred me to a therapist and i have gone twice and have seen no improvement, i know its early to say its not working but i'm at my wits end and am just tired of this feeling!"
2960,"Fast forward to my 20's, I got on meds, went to therapy and gained weight..too much (5' 1"" and 153 lbs.)"
2961,"We've been together for 5 years and he's very understanding in my fear of driving, but anytime I try to talk to him about seeing a therapist for my other issues mainly health anxiety/SSD, slight disordered eating thoughts ( I was originally 120 pounds and hit my lowest weight of 96 recently, which is just slightly underweight for my height; I'm 5'2), and just GAD, he just seems to get mad and frustrated with me saying that I just create all of these issues and need to just calm down and essentially ""get over it""."
2962,"I've tried to talk to a therapist on campus when I'm here to make it easier on him driving me around, but it's hard to see them often enough because my schedule is so hard to work around."
2963,Currently I don't have anybody to talk to about anxiety but my therapist because talking about it sends me into a panic attack.
2964,Don't have money for it and/or don't currently live in a place that has reliable/good therapists?
2965,I see a therapist at school but I'm not seeing her during the exam period.
2966,My therapist offered me medication for unrelated anxiety and I turned it down and I really regret that right now.
2967,My therapist recommended belly breathing but I find making conscious effort to prevent the anxiety/panic attacks actually makes it worse.
2968,I was in therapy but stopped about two months ago due to cost and feeling better.
2969,I suffered from serious depression from age 12 and was in therapy for five years from 20 (psychodynamic psychotherapy) which more or less gave me my life back and let me be a full person.
2970,My mom battled with depression and anxiety her whole life so when she was sick she pushed me (and my dad) to start seeing a therapist.
2971,"That helped me a lot with coping strategies and I ""graduated"" therapy in May."
2972,"I always thought it would go away on it's own, so I didn't seek therapy or meds for years."
2973,I've now been on prozac 10mg/day for 4-5 years and have seen 3 different therapist.
2974,I've been working with therapists and medication(s) over the past couple years to come to terms with my depression and anxiety with varying levels of success.
2975,"Over the past few months of twice-monthly therapist appointments, I've been building a plan to help me identify when I'm well/unwell and get well for longer periods of time."
2976,"Now that the plan's been crafted, the next logical step )in my mind) is to use the plan and therapy to address my triggers, and develop better coping skills."
2977,(Bonus points for really bad fear of failure) I've got an appointment with my meds doc tomorrow morning and a therapist appt.
2978,It was recommended to me that I should try Antidepressants that will lower my anxiety to make my therapy more effective.
2979,He currently has no insurance so seeing a therapist isn't an option.
2980,I'm looking at it as an extremely intense exposure therapy session for myself.
2981,"I can't afford a therapist (not even with a sliding scale payment) and medication doesn't help me, so I'm pretty much on my own."
2982,"Ive been to counsilors and therapists and I improove tremendously, but then at some point, a couple weeks to a couple months later, my scumbag brain takes over and im self-sabotage central."
2983,I saw a Nurse Practitioner (in conjunction with a therapist) and got prescribed Paxil and Clonazepam.
2984,"I am in therapy and have been for months, but it's not getting any better."
2985,"I like my therapist, and I don't think she is the problem."
2986,"I've been to the ER 4 times in the past week and each time it turned out to be nothing  I need to go to a therapist but i'm not financially able, no insurance, not sure how to get into it."
2987,So my therapist filed for intermittent FMLA.
2988,I wish I could talk to therapists about this but I have a hard time trusting them.
2989,Even when a therapist seems nice at first I start to see them as manipulators.
2990,"Speaking of performance anxiety, I'm presently in the process of seeing a sex therapist."
2991,"I don't like the idea of going on new medications, but I am definitely open to therapy."
2992,"Tried so much (serveral therapies, medication), failed so often."
2993,Historically it's been well managed but I had an episode starting 2 months ago that hasn't seen much improvement even though I'm seeing a therapist.
2994,I am learning to cope with that through talk therapy and exercise and it is helping.
2995,I had mentioned to my boss in passing a few weeks ago that I had a therapist/psychiatrist appointment which I was going to attend.
2996,I'm not on any medication currently and I'm on a waiting list for therapy.
2997,"A year or longer now my last therapist quit, and I lost my very last support system and friends."
2998,And I kind of feel like I'm hitting roadblocks with my therapist.
2999,"I'm in group therapy with other students,  and it has been a little helpful."
3000,"I'm seeing a psychological therapist at the moment and that really helps, but I never say what I really want to say there either."
3001,"And though I went to a therapist for many years, I haven't been to one in a while."
3002,"I have been struggling with anxiety, depression, and possible ADHD for a few years now, and I've decided that it's time to seek help; however, I am going to college in a month, and I don't know if I should find a therapist/psychiatrist here or one where I am going to school."
3003,He is on a long list of drugs and is in therapy himself.
3004,But I also think therapy could help me.
3005,I'm terrified of talking about my issues unless I'm behind a keyboard so maybe a therapist wouldn't help.
3006,Was anyone in a similar situation that went to therapy?
3007,I have a therapist I like but I don't really feel like therapy is helping me.
3008,"Lately my anxiety and panic have been acting up, I have a substance use therapist that helps a lot and am in the process of getting a dedicated anxiety therapist but I don’t want to go on medication."
3009,I'm in cognitive behavioral therapy which works on the principle that if you don't let yourself experience the fear the anxiety never abates.
3010,"So you do exposure therapy and face your fear, letting yourself be afraid without anxiety medication or alcohol, and then that fear goes away."
3011,"My therapist says I need to feel the anxiety to let it dissipate, but if this crying keeps up I'm going to puke."
3012,"I'm in a really great apartment, work is going well, relationship is going well, got me a therapist as well as a psychiatrist (no more going to a GP for anxiety issues), and I've been getting really into meditation and yoga."
3013,"stayed home from work again, a third day means i need a doctors note but my therapist is out of town."
3014,"Please share your experience of cognitive behavioural therapy, what kind of anxiety was the treatment for and did it work for you?"
3015,"* After seeing her, she suggested putting me on Zoloft starting at 0.25mg, but I wanted therapy sessions before I started taking medication."
3016,I don't know where to look for a therapist and don't know if I could afford it anyway.
3017,"Or can I just call therapists offices directly and, once things are worked out, go directly to therapists from there?"
3018,I sent this email to a therapist two days ago.
3019,"For reference, I have been to therapy sessions a few times and have scheduled a session in the near future to try to help with situation."
3020,"Here you are, just having a lovely little chat with the other person on the phone—a bit of free therapy as you climb you way down off the metaphoric ledge…or that actual ledge."
3021,My therapist recommended I look into it.
3022,I recently moved to a new country and cannot afford therapy because it's over £120 per session.
3023,"Her new insurance doesn’t pay a dime until the $1,000 copay is met – which expires in January and does not roll over into next year – so she basically is unable to see her therapist for the rest of the year unless she pays out of pocket."
3024,I've seen a couple different tests that one can do themselves to determine if they might have an anxiety problem like the Burns Anxiety Inventory our even on sites like man therapy.
3025,I live in a semi rural area with very few options for therapy.
3026,"[[Extra info if anyone wants to know: My therapist and I have been addressing this from the angle that my anxiety is probably the main culprit, and I have been on a treatment plan addressing my thought patterns and triggers, while also gradually exposing myself to new situations and responsibilities."
3027,"I've read the wikipedia pages, done several google searches, read about it on medical websites, and obviously talked to my therapist about it quite a bit."
3028,And does the therapist normally try to force an answer out of you no matter what?
3029,"Aside from seeking help, because I am starting to see a therapist next week actually."
3030,"On top of that, I am also suffering from panic attacks when I think about the people I love dying or getting hurt--this something that has affected me since I was in elementary school, and even with therapy I still have been unable to properly control myself when in the midst of a panic attack."
3031,"I was seeing a therapist at the time, which I really didn't find helpful at all."
3032,"My co-pay for therapy is $50 per 30 min session, which is expensive, and honestly I don't think it helped much."
3033,I'm in therapy and I can't get this one thought out of my mind.
3034,"My therapist says I did NOTHING wrong and I handled it better than most people, but I feel disgusting and like garbage."
3035,Has anyone ever been a patient of one of these therapists and would you recommend them?
3036,"I haven't had a flat out panic attack in years, but now...walking up stairs, going anywhere (including staying in a truck and going through a drive-through lane at the bank), stores, shops, even my therapist...it's all an instant panic attack."
3037,I do have a condition of anxiety and have been going to a therapist for 4-5 months now.
3038,"First, I'd like to start out by saying that I've recently got a new job and a new therapist and my anxiety and depression have been like 30 times better."
3039,I have been seeing a therapist for about 6 months and we have mainly focused on forms of depressive thinking and mindfulness.
3040,I picked up [Pearls IC](http://www.enzymatictherapy.com/products/Digestion/Daily-Digestion-Support/04363-Pearls-IC.aspx) which contained two of the probiotic strains mentioned in the episode.
3041,I'd read quite a bit about CBT but never went to a therapist who focused on it.
3042,Yay therapy for teaching me this technique!
3043,How do you know if it's bad enough to actually need a therapist?
3044,Did you feel like you were wasting the therapist time with 'trivial' matters?
3045,A year ago when I started seeing a therapist I was again told I had GAD and mild OCD with regards to intrusive thoughts and also a panic disorder that developed since trying to go through this medication free.
3046,"I know people believe me that I have this issue, but the best doctors and therapists can come up with is that ""I have anxiety""."
3047,So I started seeing a therapist two months ago.
3048,"I graduated with a degree in psychology last year, and I have come to feel that while pills can be effective, I would rather try my hand at therapy first, because I've heard it can work, and I'm a little spooked by the potential side effects of drugs."
3049,"I had a session today, and my therapist and I had been working through some issues surrounding sleeping alone and some health anxiety."
3050,"At the end of the session, after we had finished talking about how I was having difficulty being assertive in meetings, because I get overwhelmingly anxious and afraid to speak up, my therapist pointed out that we hadn't talked so much about my other stuff."
3051,Then my therapist said something I wasn't expecting.
3052,"She said that that was really good, and that I should go home and think about whether we needed to continue the therapy sessions, as I'd achieved some of the goals I'd come to therapy with (I guess by that she meant not being anxious about sleeping alone, or about my health)."
3053,"I didn't enter therapy just to help me sleep alone better, or to feel better about my health (and I know these anxieties will probably return, especially since I'm anticipating a move)."
3054,I entered therapy to learn and develop coping strategies and learn to manage and overcome my GAD.
3055,"My therapist wasn't saying we *had* to stop sessions, and she suggested we could redirect to other goals."
3056,"But I was shocked and little upset that she thought because I could sleep alone OK that I was ""meeting my goals,"" and would consider stopping therapy."
3057,Has anyone else gone through therapy?
3058,"Should I consider stopping therapy for a while or seeking out a different therapist (this seems like it would be a big undertaking, since my therapist spent so many sessions getting to understand my fears, but at the same time, it feels like she was too focused on one issue)?"
3059,"I think I will start by googling.. but should I see a therapist, psychologist, counselor, or psychiatrist?"
3060,"I feel like I can't do anything about this either, my therapist has tried helping me find ways to cope with this and make the transition easier but I honestly just can't think of any way to make this easier."
3061,"I have tried almost everything, including exercise 4 times a week, taking supplements such as magnesium  (every form such as chloride, glycinate, nitrate), amino acids,  l-theanine,  GABA, and kava and therapy."
3062,"As soon as I realised that it was actually all in my head pretty much the first thing I did was tell my parents ‘Hey, I think I need to go see a therapist.’ It’s kind of a long story but the general gist of what they told me was ‘You’re not making any sense, there’s nothing to be afraid of."
3063,You don’t even need a therapy – it’s not that bad.
3064,"There are people out there who actually need help and can’t get an appointment with a therapist, so don’t you dare waste their time!’ Then I’ll just pretend nothing happened until it happens again and I’ll look up local therapists and *while I’m doing that* I’ll think ‘Actually it wasn’t that bad’, close the website and ignore it *again*."
3065,"I feel like I’ve always been waiting for someone to tell me ‘Look, I hate to break it to you, but I think you need a therapy.’ But no one ever did (I don’t really have friends because who wants to be friends with someone who rarely ever leaves their flat?)"
3066,I've been working with a therapist who has taught me that the key is to come up with a solution or plan to an issue.. and if I can't at that moment-- then accept the fact that I can't and tune it out until it is time to worry about it.
3067,"I know I need to learn to deal with my issues, hopefully going back to therapy will help."
3068,"So in a therapy session last night, i was asked the following question 
""what do you think are your positive attributes ?"
3069,"my first response was to say ""I was really hoping that you wouldn't ask me that ""

and then i sat in silence, nothing would come into my head, I was stumped ( i believe thats the correct term), so my therapist started to call out the things that she see's in me and how they became more apparent since i starting therapy 8 months ago 

And then she  asked me how i felt about them, my reaction was to say ""they're not attributes , thats just how people are supposed to behave "" 

eg: Compassionate , Devoted , Courageous !"
3070,"But eventually - with a combination of meditation, therapy and Sertraline - I was panic attack-free by 2014."
3071,"I've been to the doctor, she raised my meds for now, but is going to get me into a psych therapist to better prescribe."
3072,"Despite meds and therapy I keep sliding down to where I am, unable to function at work and so afraid of failing little things that I always fail the big things."
3073,And I also see a therapist twice a week.
3074,I've made such an incredible transformation over the past month thanks to therapy and a lot of reading of self-help books.
3075,"I want to thank my psychiatrist, therapist, fiance, and family for being so understanding and helping me get through it all."
3076,"I also don't want to go to therapy anymore, I feel like they are pushing more problems than I have to me just for the money."
3077,And I'm not sure if telling my therapist this would be of any help.
3078,I have struggled with anxiety/depression for basically my entire live and have been in and out (but mostly in) therapy for about 15 years now.
3079,I have an emergency appt with my therapist Saturday.
3080,"Too scared to go to therapist, can't talk to my IRL friend cause it was me obessing over this girl and talking about her all the time last year that pushed him away, don't want that to happen again, can't talk to my online friends about it cause I have problem showing my true emotions and will likely end up pushing them away out of fear."
3081,"i've been in therapy since march and, while it's helped, i'm not sure it's helping enough and i'm not sure how i can get it to help."
3082,"Not really looking any advice, as I have resolved to get in contact with a therapist this friday when I get paid, but I just needed to get this off my chest and let everyone else who has to deal with anxiety know that I admire everyone here who makes the most of their situation."
3083,I haven't been able to see a therapist or anything because of my dad.
3084,Starting therapy soon too.
3085,"Don't wait as long as I did to get help, whether it be therapy/medication/or something else."
3086,"I've tried seeing therapists (no luck), I've tried medications (no luck)..."
3087,"She was always complaining that I don't know how to run a company, I am not brave enough in professional and social situations, that my car is not good enough, my apartment not large enough, I am not ambitious enough, even my therapy (I am well aware of my problems) was not good enough."
3088,I go therapy but it doesn't help.
3089,When I finally got over my own personal doubt and called the school therapist to set up and appointment * Which went great!
3090,"I know i'm coming out of the worst of it now, and hopefully with my therapists help i'll be able to overcome this roadblock once and for all!"
3091,"I go to the gym several days a week, see a therapist and am about to begin taking antidepressants."
3092,"I mean, people didn't have therapy a thousand years ago and some found ways to get it out of their system."
3093,"I just wonder, where is the tipping point between staying home to go to therapy and get help and having the problems caused by staying here worsen you?"
3094,"Ive told my story numerous times to many people, and each time they say i should get medical help from the likes of a therapist or psychologist or whatever."
3095,"Ive spoke to my mother about therapy today, and she spoke to my dad about it for me."
3096,School is also keeping me from my therapy groups and I can't skip class every week.
3097,"I start therapy next week, hopefully this can help me shake this horrible feeling."
3098,"I just started treatment (meds + therapy) for depression and GAD, and a new major source of anxiety for me is that my health care providers don't believe me -- I worry that I'm just whiny, it's just first world problems, I'm somehow faking it, I'm not sick enough, it's all in my head, etc."
3099,"I have had bad experiences with doctors and therapists before, so this is not really coming out of nowhere."
3100,"I should note I have had therapy, I have taken group anxiety disorder classes which taught cognitive behavioural therapy."
3101,I was going to therapy but quit going around the time I started dating my boyfriend because I didn't feel connected to the therapist and felt guilty going to a different one.
3102,"Im only 22 and have meds and regular therapy, but still this waking panic is such a shit way to start the day."
3103,"I started going to therapy, but she cannot prescribe medication."
3104,"In that short space of time we have been seeing each other once a week for EMDR sessions, and the latest session was an exposure therapy session."
3105,"I had to stop seeing my therapist, stop taking my meds and stop seeing my doctor."
3106,"Sure, I'm currently seeing a therapist and getting prescriptions for generic xanax, but I would like to do more."
3107,"I had a therapy session for OCD and depression, with a new therapist, and it's really my first one."
3108,"I, obviously, know that therapy is not supposed to be comfortable but I am struggling with the idea of going back."
3109,I also know that I am not going to click with every therapist and that personality/style conflicts are real.
3110,I just don't want to abandon this ship quite yet to go to another therapist and maybe it is the same experience.
3111,"Is this a ""hey powertape33 grow some balls and nut up"" kind of thing, a ""you're just a little insecure, go exercise"" kind of thing,  or is this a ""hey, you should see a therapist or consider anxiety medication"" kind of thing?"
3112,"Finally, since summer of last year I have been seeing a therapist who is using CBT and I am still not succeeding."
3113,My therapist tries to motivate me but it's just not working out.
3114,"And to top it off I can't believe that exercising, having a good diet, doing some 5htp/omega 3/ therapy/ meds can stop these thoughts or this identification with anxiety."
3115,"(Family doesn't want me back in therapy, I have no way to get there or pay for it myself.)"
3116,"Thankfully, over the summer I started going back to therapy and taking an anti-depressant, which has for the most part kept the most severe aspects of my depression under control."
3117,Two days ago was my first meeting with a therapist to get over this.
3118,I have no real experience with therapist or therapy.
3119,They are all my therapists.
3120,"I started talking to a therapist about it, and seeing
my cardiologist."
3121,"Taking him to my therapist doesn't work, since he twists everything she says to whatever benefits him the most."
3122,"*I guess this is the best subreddit for writing about my experience.. so here I go..*

Its sometimes difficult do describe your exactly 'ilness' or in better words: to be exact as possible when using words like anxiety disorder or depression, but thinking of all that I've read, experienced and got explained from my psychotherapist/ psychologist, the title describes it at best."
3123,** I told myself that I have a serious problem and I searched for a therapist and after some while I finally found one.
3124,"I did a behavior therapy (which was actually about talking a lot about my exactly fears and the consequences) and since my symptoms were so strong, I was send to a psychologist, who was responsible for my medication."
3125,I can say the medications combined with the therapy helped me to come out of that fucked up situations.
3126,"** Well, I can't tell 100% for sure, but I guess the therapy combined with the medications, which I still take today, helped a lot, it did the start-up."
3127,Once we get moved I plan on seeking out another therapist.
3128,I am currently seeing a therapist for it.
3129,"My wife has GAD, and is working on starting therapy."
3130,I've been struggling with anxiety for about 5 years now (in and out of therapy) have a problem with worrying too much and blaming everything bad that happens on myself.
3131,"With the help of (very weak) meds, a therapist and a lot of sports I got rid of them (hadnt had one in two/three weeks) which I am very happy about."
3132,I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow but it's difficult because she wants me to get re-diagnosed by a psychiatrist to find out what's really going on.
3133,My panic disorder still continues to rear it's ugly head and therapy doesn't seem to work nor does taking antidepressants (I was on Paxil but now on Prozac).
3134,"*

I asked him last night if he would consider going to a psychiatrist again and do therapy/go on meds again."
3135,I'm seeing two therapists for it at the moment.
3136,I went to a therapist and that didn't help.
3137,Not therapy though cause I was going abroad again for school where I am uninsured and there is a bit of a language barrier.
3138,"I meet with my current therapist almost once a week,and she is honestly the best I have had so far."
3139,"I have had to recently increase my dosage of sertraline,on instruction of my therapist,and not experienced any new or ""extra"" side-effects."
3140,I just called her therapist and left her a message saying she needs to talk to her.
3141,"I've been to therapy and that didn't help, every psychiatrist I see usually ends up messing up medicines because of mistakes they make somewhere i the process."
3142,"My mom was prescribed anti-anxiety meds herself just a few months ago, but I don't want my parents to pay for a therapist we can't afford if it's not a serious issue."
3143,"I've been seeing a therapist, but that doesn't help."
3144,I finally sought help for my depressive episodes I have been experiencing and my therapist referred me to a psychiatrist and that I be treated for depression and ANXIETY.
3145,After meeting with a therapist I have found this subreddit and have been educating myself and I am so appalled that I have been so misinformed.
3146,I finally found the right medicine and the right therapist to transform my incorrect and irrational thought processes through psycho therapy.
3147,"Friends, it took me 6 years of therapy and medicine experimentation to find the most fitting treatment."
3148,I also got an excellent therapist who wants to see me twice a week.
3149,"I'm actually currently training to become a psychologist, so I'm familiar with therapy options."
3150,"im pretty new to all this

so ive been thinking about going to therapy for about two years now but the thing is i live with my parents and i dont drive plus they would be the ones paying, so basically i would need to ask them for me to go to therapy."
3151,"I used to go to a therapist because of my depression/anxiety, after a few months I started feeling better and the therapist told me he thinks I can go on alone from this point."
3152,I thought I'd make this post and see if I could therapy myself back down to feeling balanced again.
3153,I have been going through exposure therapy and it has really helped me with social anxiety.
3154,My therapist knows about my troubles still with my high school boyfriend and the lasting effects of his abuse on me still to this day.
3155,"Recently, my therapist has asked me to practice looking at pictures of him on his facebook."
3156,"I've never been one to want to go to an actual doctor or therapist for anything, I'd rather find another way of going about treating it/handling it."
3157,I asked my therapist about this and he didn't know what to tell me to do to try to work on it.
3158,"I've been seeing a therapist once a month for a few months (I like her but I'm not sure if its helpful or not), my husband has been taking off work to take me and that can't go on forever."
3159,"I have done the therapy thing, and it has helped, but presently that's not something I can afford to do."
3160,"We do have resources locally that can help people who need free or low cost therapy/meds/etc, but the last time I went through them I had a really terrible experience and stopped, which is also a source of great shame and guilt and anxiety and depression."
3161,"I have gone to a therapist before, but I've been putting off making another appointment because I don't want to face anything and I don't want to fix anything."
3162,"I've been getting over it slowly thorugh meditation and mindfullness/acceptance therapy, and also through yoga, bike rides, CBT, DBT, etc."
3163,"Like my rational brain turns off and I'm left with animal mind which I can't control, which no amount of therapy can touch."
3164,"Anyway, the mental health clinic that I was referred to for short term therapy (only kind I can get for free as I have no insurance and cannot afford long term therapy) finally called after going over the background paperwork they had me fill out and assigned me a doctor."
3165,"I'm not sure what sort of answers I really expect, but as someone who has never gone to therapy before, is there anything I need to know going in?"
3166,"Over the past few years, I have been working closely with a therapist and have really gotten a lot better!"
3167,"i am supposed to start working at my new job the next week and i just don't know if i can or should go if i stayed like this.. i always think of the worst case scenarios that even if i got schizophrenia i will have the one with poorest prognosis (disorganized type) and i will get no help and end up homeless and forgotten.. my current therapist totally dismisses this thought and told me it stems from my anxiety but somehow i can't stop thinking about it..
any tips will be appreciated :)"
3168,I want to go back to counseling but I hate that I try to make the therapist like me.
3169,I have GAD and MDD and I'm currently seeing a therapist for both.
3170,I am seeing a therapist but I've only seen her twice in the past 4 weeks because she's been out of the office.
3171,"I wish I had medication or SOMETHING to help me cope but I have nothing except for self injury, which is how I used to cope, but my therapist doesn't want me doing that anymore."
3172,I've attempted therapy only to not go back because it scares me.
3173,"So for general anxiety I noticed a big change and for social I noticed a slight change, I am still going to therapy and he knows I still need work with the social aspect of it but I think the meds helped me by 70-80% and that is huge to me and should be for other people too."
3174,He recommended in private that I'd consider therapy.
3175,"Talked to my old psych teacher, she really recommended therapy."
3176,"No public transportation in my area, but my question is how would I find out about therapists and medical insurance coverage in my area?"
3177,I have been seeing a therapist till pretty recently.
3178,I don't have time to see my therapist.
3179,"i feel like seeing a therapist would help me so much, but i'm scared to ask my parents about it for a few reasons:

1. my younger sister has been depressed/anxious/suicidal for years now and i don't want my parents to be anymore stressed than they already are."
3180,2. i'd feel like a burden making my parents pay for therapy.
3181,"3. i feel like therapy might not work

4. i dont trust any drugs they would give me (like paxil or some bullshit) because they haven't been tested for a long time, and frankly i just don't think they work for a lot of people."
3182,"i'm so sorry for this but i'm about to write a novel

history: i have been diagnosed with the most severe case of generalized anxiety disorder my therapist had seen in someone as young as myself."
3183,"i am currently 19 but i was diagnosed when i was like... 14 or 15. yes, i was one of those growing up... been to hospital after hospital on medicines i couldn't even spell at the time and had more therapists and psychs than i have fingers to count them on."
3184,I've been through therapy/meds/partial hospitalization etc.
3185,Still in therapy at the moment.
3186,"My therapist helps, she calls me out on my negativity, and encourages me to work through the uncomfortable feelings."
3187,I'm so scared that I can't do it I know I'm going to be mentally exhausted from it all and I don't want that I have been doing great since I've been in therapy and am off my medication now.
3188,"I've been to therapy, I've been taking my meds, but I can't shake this feeling."
3189,"Those of you who have been to therapy for anxiety and ended it, what made you decide to be done?"
3190,I would love to talk this over with a therapist but have NO idea how to go about finding the right one for me.
3191,After about 8 months of therapy and trying just about every anti-aniety/anti-depressive med I finally found a combination of Ativan and BuSpar that got me back in the saddle.
3192,"I've mentioned this to my Psych and Therapist, but I don't want to play ""medication bingo' again with all the side effects it entails, and my therapist, while well meaning is no match for the anxiety and pessimism in my head."
3193," Basically I am traumatized from therapy, from the truest definition of the word, since it almost got me killed and I was kicked out of my house to be in the place where I was abused and traumatized."
3194,So I need to get to a place where I can see another therapist without thinking of all this stuff.
3195,"I'm tired of relying on other therapists to magically appear, so I was wondering if there were any good books or types of therapy I could read about that will help me get to that place?"
3196,Anyways....what are some good books to read so I can overcome my fear of seeing another therapist?
3197,"Heck, I didn't even know what the word ""anxiety"" was until I got involved in therapy."
3198,From there I could work with my therapist on treating the mental illness that had just seemingly paralyzed me.
3199,"However, I didn't get into therapy until a month had passed."
3200,"Of course, I broke any distortion of reality later on in my therapy and realized that those thoughts and mental images were my own."
3201,"I doubt the existence of the latter in the first place, now that I have been in therapy and have recovered thus far."
3202,A month into therapy and my daily tremors and anxiety attacks stop.
3203,A few months into therapy and I was well into recovery.
3204,I've met with this therapist twice.
3205,I'm considering dropping out of therapy but I know I probably shouldn't.
3206,"Today is day 12 and today I was able to not only leave my house for therapy, but spend two hours in a grocery store doing a much-needed large grocery shop."
3207,"She prescribed me .25 Xanax and told me to take when I felt myself get worked up, a chiropractor, PT, and a regular therapist."
3208,I'm very happy I went through with it but my main concern is talking to a therapist...
3209,"Last point, if you need to see a therapist from any trauma to acute stressor in your life, or your job or something like that, all that other stuff will help without a doubt but you need to deal with the issues in your life too."
3210,"For all these years I have thought that my fear was about getting sick again (the symptoms of my physical disease and the anxiety are somewhat similar, mainly nausea), but during a conversation I had with a therapist yesterday, I realized that what I fear the are anxiety symptoms."
3211,Can the right therapist help me?
3212,"So I found a woman's relationship group in my town, interviewed with the therapist leading the group and was asked to join."
3213,"I called my therapist and she gave me a pep talk, and then I called the group leader who was incredibly understanding and supportive."
3214,Has treating your anxiety (meds/therapy) helped this at all?
3215,"im not sure whether to talk to my parents about it more than i already have, go see a therapist, or how to improve upon these feelings."
3216,"Today I went to my therapy, and my guy made a fucking INCREDIBLE point."
3217,I self diagnosed myself with anxiety (sort of) and currently see a therapist at my school.
3218,"If it helps, my therapist says i have issues with catastrophic thought patterns"
3219,"I haven't left my house in 2 months, haven't seen my therapist in 3 months."
3220,One of the main issues I struggle with in therapy is viewing myself as abnormal and inferior to those who do not have depression or a type of anxiety disorder.
3221,"Might be a stupid question, but I've been dealing with anxiety, lethargy, and excessive perspiration on and off for years, and I've never been to a doctor about it (but recently started with a therapist)."
3222,"I'm on medication and seeing a therapist, and I'm actually doing fairly well except for a pervasive fear that I'm going to have a stroke and/or die."
3223,"So after seeing a lot of therapists, I finally got one who's actually making me understand myself."
3224,I'm going to see my therapist again this week.
3225,My dream has always been writing and therapy.
3226,My therapist said that I had generalized anxiety disorder- but I wonder if I truly do?
3227,"I tried to do therapy, they wanted to put me on anti-depression, which I turned down, due to my phobia of pharma and my lack of distrust at the time with doctors and shrinks."
3228,"***

My desire goes on waves, and right now my desire is low and my depression is getting worse, my fears are still very bad, I have no money for doctors, and therapy sessions, I really want help some how and hope that I can find it either in the real world or on a platform like reddit that can lead to real world help."
3229,"Hi everyone, I had a quick question about seeking therapy in the US."
3230,"My problem with seeking therapy is that, frankly, the US psychology community makes me incredibly uncomfortable."
3231,"So, I have two questions: First, are there any ""pro-choice"" therapy choices in the US, that are not associated with the APA?"
3232,"And second, since I'm guessing there aren't, any guesses about how it would go over if I were to explicitly tell the therapist that they are never to bring up the subject of suicide (among others) while they are in session with me?"
3233,"I have some familiarity with the subject, as my SO has gone through a long process of taming her own beast (GAD) with a combination of therapy and meds."
3234,"I went to therapy to deal with long standing anxiety, depression etc and it went great and my life completely turned around."
3235,She goes to therapy once a week on average.
3236,"Now I am considering therapy but I'm afraid I won't be able to get help because I feel like my anxiety if I do have it, is too mild."
3237,I guess I am just lost and I am looking for some advice on therapy and medication or just some comforting words.
3238,I'm just now starting the physical therapy process and I'm wondering if all of these changes and events have caused me more stress and anxiety than I realize.
3239,I did message my therapist so hopefully she will get back to me early Monday morning.
3240,"If you need, get a psychologist, psychiatrist or a psychotherapist, and talk about your problems."
3241,"For the last 6 months I have been seeing a therapist and thing have gotten better, i've been able to go to the shops on my own and even helped my guitar teacher at some of his bands gigs."
3242,i saw a therapist/psych combo for about two years (for anxiety as well as quite a few other things) until i realized it was a waste of too much money because nothing was working.
3243,"I really don't know how I could talk this out with a therapist(I guess they could tell me to find something to do that is relaxing but I need to be able to just sit still and just chill and hangout with my fiance, the kids, the rest of the family, ect... without having to look like I""m going 90mph."
3244,After about 5 years of the therapy / drug game (people tend to play in their teens if things aren't going well) I only recently figured out that I inherited a sensitivity to substances from my mother.
3245,Two years of therapy and I'm still terrified.
3246,"I went through a whirlwind of medications, therapists, good and bad times."
3247,Well I started having anxiety this year and I'm going to see a therapist tomorrow.
3248,Can anyone share some positive experiences in therapy?
3249,"(For the record, I've been in therapy for a bunch of years."
3250,"My current therapist is amazingly clued and effective but expensive, so I only get to see her maybe once a month at best.)"
3251,"Once coming back to school and starting therapy at the counseling center I asked my therapist if I could get an appointment with a psychiatrist on campus, just for a consultation to be sure I was on the right medicine and what not."
3252,"I have been in therapy for social anxiety for almost 6 months now, and I have about reached the point where I am seriously considering psychotropic medication."
3253,My goal is to use them for the short term and continue therapy in an effort to become a happier person.
3254,I'm seeing a therapist and have been trying to do yoga and meditation to get my thoughts to stop running.
3255,- Do people discriminate differently against those taking medications for anxiety vs. those pursuing exclusively non-pharmaceutical therapy?
3256,by providing evidence that the therapy would not interfere with my ability to work)?
3257,"I've seen therapist, and am currently on Paroxetine but I don't really know if it does much, and I don't talk to a therapist anymore because I've always had a hard time talking about my feelings and stuff."
3258,"Now, I'm home and yesterday I went to go see a therapist who diagnosed me with severe anxiety and depression."
3259,"However, the therapist has recommended me to another doctor who she wants to prescribe me an SSRI."
3260,"Towards the end of my therapy session today we were talking about my childhood and the lack of comfort and emotion given to me, and all of a sudden I had this massive realization that I don't have a single memory of ever being held, hugged, cuddled or comforted by my mother."
3261,"My mom understands why I get scared thanks to lots of family therapy, but she still sighs and tells me I'm being ridiculous which makes me feel awful."
3262,I also know that its about time for me to start some sort of therapy again.
3263,"However, I hadn't had good luck at finding a psychiatrist who is good at both the therapy side as well as the medication side."
3264,"It seems like I either find a shrink who just wants to push pills, or someone who thinks everything can be solved without drugs and only therapy."
3265,I did manage to get on the wait list (a wait list for therapy?)
3266,Well four years passed without those attacks after getting help from a therapist.
3267,What should I do about this...I have been to two different therapists.
3268,I did not feel like I was seeing results/getting what I wanted from the first therapist even though I did all of his homework assignments and learned the breathing techniques.
3269,"My second therapist is nice and keeps trying to help me see the flaws in my logic, but I just can't shake the horrible feeling."
3270,Maybe for some of you therapy or medication hasnt been working and isnt the answer.
3271,"If there is nothing medically wrong, than trying out medication or seeking therapy can really help."
3272,"This can be through friends, family, or any type of therapy."
3273,My therapist and I are working on coping but I only just met her and I feel like I'm running out of time for goodness sakes I only meet with her once a week and there are only 9 weeks left not counting the week where I get my wisdom teeth removed and I go to San Antonio with my church and orientation.
3274,Bill Murray is this total nutter who can't deal with his therapist going on vacation.
3275,My therapist keeps talking about *things* and *thoughts* that make me feel anxious.
3276,"But on the other hand, that's all there is to psychotherapy concerning my condition as a whole."
3277,"Ok, I do get advice with dealing with relationships (I'm also borderline,) but if I feel all her suggestions for dealing with my anxiety are just a way of blaming me for something I can't control, what the hell is the point of therapy?"
3278,"It's caused me to seek therapy, get on medication, read self-help books, surf this subreddit, read others' stories..."
3279,I have been meeting with a therapist for a few months and he recently suggested I see a psychiatrist.
3280,"My therapist thinks that my anxiety is only a symptom of my actual problem, depression."
3281,"I don't know exactly how something like that might work, but I was thinking about offering to assist people with exposure therapy or give some advice from my own experiences."
3282,"I've been going to therapy for some time now for help with a panic disorder, and it has finally hit me...so many poor decisions I've made and opportunities I've screwed up in the past likely had much to do with my condition, one that I've neglected to take seriously and treat until now."
3283,My therapist warned me when we began some months ago about how most people feel worse before they begin to feel better.
3284,I expressed to my therapist that I was worried about all the work I was missing for appointments and panic attacks.
3285,I have had therapy where i talk to someone but not CBT.
3286,"So, I had seen 2 therapists before in my life throughout high school."
3287,"We would sit in uncomfortable silence for about 30 minutes and the therapist would comment on my body language and how emotionless I looked, etc."
3288,I gave up on therapy because finding the right mg of my medication seemed to reduce my problems to the point that I could have a normal life.
3289,"I realized that I really don't have any skills to cope with my problems and I can't stand to really talk to people about how I feel, so maybe I need to go to a therapist again."
3290,"I hated therapy because it made me feel humiliated to have someone watch me cry and spill my guts, and I also never was in a mood to talk when I had a scheduled appointment."
3291,My therapist is on maternity leave until June.
3292,"So, I am going to try to find a therapist in my area to get help."
3293,It took a while for me to work with my therapist to figure out when and how much I should smoke to gain the right effects.
3294,"I was talking to my therapist about my family situation growing up, and how I could never afford to be angry for fear of the consequences."
3295,"I have pretty bad social/generalized anxiety and depression and I'm going off to college next year, my therapist and I were talking about me being able to bring an emotional support animal with me."
3296,"I didn't see a therapist, just mostly stuck it out until he came home."
3297,"I wasn't on any meds, just dealing with it through a little therapy (that was pretty useless)."
3298,"I told my GP about my anxiety, and I was looking for a referral to a good cognitive behavioral therapist (CBT)."
3299,"I've been seeing a therapist for over three years, and I've been seeing psychiatrists since I was around 8."
3300,"I have an appt with my therapist on Tuesday so I just kind of need to get through until then,  Anything will help!"
3301,I've been through therapy before for other issues so I'm not too worried about seeing a therapist.
3302,"I keep thinking about ""what if there's something more wrong...what if I can't get a hold of my anxiety...what if this only gets worse...what if the pain in my hand from the IV is a blood clot...what if I get sick again...what if my boyfriend can't handle being with me ...what if the doctor missed something ...what happens if I see the therapist and they can't help me...""

I think you get the picture."
3303,"I saw a therapist for about 6 weeks, but he mostly harped on with a kind of pseudo-New Age crap that made me feel frustrated and uncomfortable."
3304,"I'm thinking of seeing a doctor to get a permit to stay home instead (I have a history of therapy, so it could be possible), but I'm not even sure how that would work."
3305,I have just started seeing a therapist as well.
3306,"___________


As you can probably guess I haven't talked to my therapist about the anxiety stuff yet."
3307,"I have just started thinking its the problem, and well I don't talk to people and this therapy thing is tricky, since thats what they expect me to do."
3308,I am seeing a therapist because of my anxiety and ADD but my panic attacks are getting worse and more frequent.
3309,"My therapist said she still wants to get to know me before discussing any techniques but like I said, I'm getting worse and I feel that I need help sooner rather than later."
3310,"That doctor put me on the waiting list for seeing a therapist, and the waiting list is very long: It's been more than a month, and I don't have an appointment yet, although I'm so desperate to see a therapist."
3311,"I can't imagine any therapy curing this, because I'm a very self-conscious person and I try thinking positive thoughts all day, but they never **really** help."
3312,"I used to talk to a therapist, but I felt that I wasn't getting anywhere plus she moved to a place that didn't take my insurance."
3313,I've also tried a couple non-prescribing therapists over this summer and have failed to connect with any of them or found their techniques self-explanatory and basic.
3314,I go to therapy once a week and I'm honestly so close to just breaking down in therapy.
3315,"I decided to tell them about my anxiety so I could go about getting help from doctors and therapists, but all they've (my parents) done is make me feel worse."
3316,Is this talk therapy fixable?
3317,"Just a note - I'm on 0.25 mg klonopin nightly for 2 years now, 75 mg of zoloft and going thru a very hard therapy (Talking about this things makes me quite uneasy as you can imagine)."
3318,"Not even half way through the semester, I just lost interest in Art therapy."
3319,"i have to go to a domestic violence class, an AA class and mandatory therapy."
3320,"Edit: I have a therapist, but honestly they don't seem to be helping."
3321,This led me to a lot of reading and time with a cognitive therapist that helped me to turn things around.
3322,I've been trying to handle this by going to therapy through my college's psych services.
3323,"Right before I left to go home, my therapist referred me to a psychiatrist and he recommended that I start SSRIs when I get back to college."
3324,I have an appt with my therapist in the near future so hopefully that will help.
3325,"Or should I try to go all out and tackle my anxiety to the fullest and try to stop it before it picks up any steam via medicine, therapy, etc?"
3326,Should I talk to a therapist/psychiatrist.
3327,I've been struggling with health anxiety for several months and my therapist has suggested the possibility of citalopram.
3328,"The things my therapist suggested doing to block out the racing thoughts aren't working, my new meds haven't started working yet so I'm having a drink to shut my head up."
3329,I'm not sure what's happening right now and the therapist (who the referral was for) said she'd look into it and get back to me.
3330,"The therapist will forget about me, since that unfortunately seems to be a regular occurrence when I seek help."
3331,Even had a panic attack while on the phone with the therapist (when she told me she never got my referral).
3332,Also yes- I have a therapist and am healthy as far as I know (I've had full blood work and a physical and all that stuff semi-recently).
3333,"She claims that she doesn't want to be a ""zombie"" on medication (she gets mad ad me for even suggesting this route), and that talking her issues out to some sort of therapist or counselor is ""stupid"" and ""pointless""."
3334,"I've done years of therapy and my life appears to be good right now, but this sinking feeling hit me this morning."
3335,"So I have a social anxiety disorder, but I saw a therapist about it a few years ago, and the social side of things is so so much better now."
3336,"I have booked a doctors appointment to speak about cognitive behavioural therapy, and also me and my aforementioned friend are going for Starbucks today."
3337,"I'm seeing a therapist but It's not enough, i don't know what to do, I feel like shit."
3338,"I've been battling generalized anxiety disorder (in retrospect) for 5 years and for three years now I'm in therapy, though not consistently, as my study often prevented me from making appointments."
3339,Recently my therapist suggested seeing a psychiatrist to evaluate possible medication and he urged me to try as he thought my problems had lasted for too long while only getting worse instead of better.
3340,I need to get into intensive therapy.
3341,I have reached out to a few therapists and not followed up because I was scared I would make a wrong decision that would get me in to trouble.
3342,"Pop culture likes to show single therapy sessions as effective enough for people to just do it occasionally to top off the mental health tank
I have the ramblings of a mad man."
3343,Now I'm on meds and therapy but I soil have really bad days.
3344,"If it helps, I have been diagnosed with moderate OCD by a therapist a couple years back."
3345,"I have begged him to take his meds, or to go see a therapist because of all this but he refuses."
3346,The plan was to go see a therapist and hopefully get me ready to go back to school when I was ready.
3347,For now the psychologist is suggesting individual therapy for him and group sessions to help him learn to interact with other kids.
3348,"e. If you HAVE been raped, traumatized, suffered long, and so forth, go to a **therapist** as well and try some Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to recondition how you think."
3349,I'm doing everything right-- Medicine exercise and therapy yet I'm fucking dying.
3350,I also would like to point out that im 17 a female and currently seeing a therapist and taking zoloft.
3351,I did some research on Anxiety/panic attacks and ended up making an appointment with a therapist who attributed it to too much stress.
3352,By late April I had a follow-up with the same therapist and I told her I was almost feeling back at 100% and it was great and everything was nice.
3353,I see my psychiatrist tomorrow and I didn't mention this to my therapist because she advised against taking classes but I don't have the money to start repaying my loans from my first college which was super expensive.
3354,I've spoken about all this with my therapist many times and she has basically told me that being proud of my appearance is fine but obsessing over it is my constant anxiety rearing its ugly head since I basically have nothing to worry about.
3355,I have an appointment with my therapist next Wednesday but I'm thinking of trying to get an earlier appointment b/c I'm really freaked out.
3356,I'm new to this whole Internet group therapy type-thing so forgive me if I make mistakes.
3357,I have nothing against therapy but i would like to also be medicated.
3358,I got an appointment with a therapist at my local mental health clinic in 2 weeks and an appointment with my doctor next week to hopefully get a stronger med at the xanax isn't working as good as it did.
3359,"My therapist, whom I've seen for only two sessions so far, mentioned a therapy used for traumas called EMDR."
3360,I've done a lot of reading and found some papers published showing that this therapy has fully cured kids and adults with much worse choking phobias (to the point of having to be tube-fed).
3361,"For one, I watched some videos of people going through the therapy for other traumas, and I noticed that they get certain sensations while thinking about the traumatic events, even before the eye movements start."
3362,Has anyone been the same way while going through this therapy?
3363,"During the first session, my therapist said he would explain EMDR and what was gonna happen next time."
3364,"I think that might have to do with a video being unable to replace a trained therapist, but I was hoping I could at least test it to see if it would work."
3365,My parents never sought any therapy or treatment for it because they thought I would just grow out of it.
3366,"To keep things short:
I'm 16, have social anxiety, got counselling individually and now I'm in group counselling/therapy 

I feel like I've made 0 progess, I can't even talk during group..."
3367,I've had bad anxiety for several years and for a while I was able to suppress it through the help of therapy.
3368,"I don't see it as life breaking enough to get a therapist, but it still bothers me."
3369,"I am not on medication or in therapy right now because I have no health insurance whatsoever, am poor, and live in a country far from my family or other people who could help."
3370,"I've been to PTSD therapy, had EMDR for a couple of months and the flashbacks went away."
3371,"Got a therapist, some help to get back on my feets (*i lost my job because of a really severe anxiety attack*) and even support from some of my social circles."
3372,"I'm at the point where I'm lying to friends, to my family, to my therapist and even my girlfriend that everything is fine."
3373,Should i ask my therapist for stronger drugs and should i show her the self harm of the recent weeks ?
3374,"I'm going to start seeing a new therapist and want to talk to him/her about medication options, and I want to be informed."
3375,"Since then, I've been able to manage my anxiety through medication (Paxil, once a day) and therapy, which I still attend sometimes."
3376,My therapist and psychiatrist think it's an anxiety response.
3377,He's tried therapy and medication in the past and is resistant to trying them again because he believes they won't work.
3378,My therapist and I will touch on it when she gets back from vacation but I'd like to start working on myself now.
3379,I started seeing a therapist a couple of months ago for a total of ten sessions to date.
3380,"During our session today, I mentioned that I just want to be able to get my shit together so that ""I didn't have to see [my therapist] forever."""
3381,I'm curious: how long have you been seeing your therapist?
3382,Anyone else having a hard time finding the right therapist?
3383,I go to therapy but don't take meds.
3384,"female, not on meds, really horrible anxiety and OCD problems according to a therapist I had once."
3385,"I also don't have the slightest clue whether I should be seeking out the help from a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist."
3386,I have a therapist whom I see maybe once a month.
3387,Her sessions are 1/6 of a price of other therapists' prices in my city because she's still in the process of getting the certification in therapy (she has a degree in psychology).
3388,"I'm conflicted guys, is it worth it cashing out or should I just stick to this therapist and try to make it work?"
3389,"After a summer of hell I finally sought help, and today I was supposed to meet with my therapist for our first session where we would begin CBT and medication."
3390,"I sent my therapist an email apologizing, but I feel like they will just think I am avoiding treatment."
3391,I'm currently not seeing a therapist or talking meds because I'm too nervous to.
3392,"Furthermore,  his depression went on, eventually got into therapy and on meds, which has made him more of an asshole now than normal."
3393,"I don't have the money to find a therapist, but I am very interested in doing everything possible to educate myself on this."
3394,"I have tried talk therapy off and on for years but have never felt like it was anything more than another ""to-do"" on my miles long list of things to do on a given day."
3395,"I couldn't find a therapist that took my health insurance that had an appointment any time before I left, so my father's psychiatrist has volunteered to see me so I can talk to him for free."
3396,I never thought my anxiety was bad enough to go a therapist.
3397,I don't want to go to a therapist because I get really stressed when thinking about sitting and talking to someone.
3398,"Today, I went to the psychiatrist and they got to know me, and basically told me going to group therapy is going to help."
3399,Sometimes therapy is the way to go.
3400,I have been in therapy for over seven years.
3401,So I have begun to reach out to therapists to get a grip on my GAD.
3402,"Psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist?"
3403,Was on several meds up until I was about 15 and my therapist and psych weaned me off of them over time.
3404,"So for awhile I've had a fear of world war 3 because of the North Korean nuke threat, I kept it down enough that I stayed away from a therapist, however, recently theres been statements that a wrong move will lead to ww3, long story short my anxiety is creeping back and I'm not necesassarily asking for a solution, just someone to talk to, to keep my mind off it."
3405,"I see a therapist and psychiatrist, and take antianxiety meds."
3406,"He lives in another state and normally I don't ever attempt long-distance things, but somehow this person is different (someone I know mutually for years) and at the behest of my friends and therapist, I am going to pursue it, whatever the consequences."
3407,"I see a therapist, I take medications, I meditate and although I really should be calling my therapist, I just need to write this out and see if anyone has any similar experiences."
3408,"Go back to the therapist I was seeing briefly after my hospital visits(the issue being cost, and I'm usually calm enough between visits that I simply don't have new content to bring up)?"
3409,"He suggested I see a therapist and that was probably the best advice he could have given me, seeing how I couldnt take another 4 months off of work."
3410,The therapist did wonders for me and I was able to lead a relatively anxiety free life.
3411,"I just made an appointment to see my therapist on Monday, but I have so much stuff to do over the weekend."
3412,"I am currently finishing my last semester of college and my anxiety/depression has been skyrocketing for almost a month due to relationship issues, lack of therapy, and being overwhelmed with my schoolwork."
3413,"I haven’t gone to my last two therapy appointments because I just don’t feel that I can leave the house (thank goodness my school offers some of their classes online) and I have cancelled on my psychiatrist (just gives me meds) twice, as well."
3414,The topic of meds comes up between my therapist and I once in a while.
3415,"My social worker from the hospital, who I was counting on to help me find a therapist and get on disability, hasn't called me back."
3416,I went for a check up yesterday and my Dr. asked if I'd thought about therapy and I just burst into tears.
3417,"I have no idea how to find a therapist, or even what kind I want."
3418,I find that it's really hard to find a therapist who gives a crap about my anxiety.
3419,"So I finally managed to start CBT for my depression and anxiety, and the therapist agreed with me that dealing with the anxiety first would make it easier for me to deal with the depression."
3420,"It's basically aversion therapy, treating my anxiety like a phobia and forcing me to face it by going in social situations to see that there isn't too much that can go horrible wrong."
3421,And now my therapist is telling me to do it and I just want to quit rather than keep going with it.
3422,(I have seen a psychotherapist but that didn't help at all.)
3423,"I don't get panic attacks like some of you guys do (I used to have them, but zoloft and therapy made them go away), but my mind and general anxiety won't let me enjoy life because I'm so afraid of changes and new experiences."
3424,I felt crippling fear nearly every day and eventually found sanctuary in therapy and a Prozac regiment.
3425,"The option has always come up during my therapy discussions, but I never forfeit to it because I don't want to feel worse than I already do."
3426,"She starts therapy, but the therapists we can afford aren't clicking with her."
3427,"It is as simple as believing you are okay
If you are scared of something do not let that stop you from doing it, FEAR IS NOT REAL, Most fear that stems from anxiety comes from a fear of the unknown or the nonphysical so why worry about something that is essentially nothing
It does go away, and you don't need to tell yourself it won't, that's extremely counter-productive

Anxiety is something we as ALL humans have evolved to have, it helps us when the situation arises, right now your brain is just fritzing and stressing about every little thought ""would a crazy person think this"" ""Why am I acting this way"" ""will I ever go back to normal"" Guess what guys, you are already normal, you don't need meds or even a therapist."
3428,She is depressed with her life and is currently finding help with two therapists.
3429,"The kicker is that usually my therapist helps talk sense to me with this type of stuff, but this time I left more worried than I was when I came in."
3430,"Usually I get anxiety over something and I fear that it’s a big danger and risk, and my time with my therapist helps me understand I’m being irrational."
3431,I'm also struggling because my therapy sessions aren't going particularly well.
3432,She seems to feel that I'm in too bad a place for therapy to be very effective.
3433,I went to therapy about 2 years ago now for when I was having over the top anxiety and often having panic attacks.
3434,I think this was cause I had no idea what was happening to my body until I told my doctor and started therapy.
3435,I don't know what a therapist can do for me since I'm afraid of therapy.
3436,"I have noticed that my anxiety, even with medication and therapy, has been higher than it's been in well over a decade."
3437,The Prozac didn't make a lick of a difference and before I went off it I was on 60mg and 10mg of bus par...  For the therapy side I just didn't feel right...  Every time I went in I couldn't explain what was wrong and sometimes felt nothing was wrong...
3438,"I find I've always got simmering anxiety (though working on it with a psychotherapist has been helping a lot) and with it, I feel like I'm constantly nauseated."
3439,I've been going to talk therapy for couple months and it's helping some but I still feel like this a lot and I just don't know what to do.
3440,"These are very crazy preconditions, until you realize I'm not looking for employment, I'm looking for therapy."
3441,Recently I just started EMDR therapy.
3442,Been going to therapy for as long as I can remember however worries never seem to leave me.
3443,"I'll be starting independent therapy in the next few weeks, and I'll have meetings every other week."
3444,"I don't want a therapist, I don't want someone to fix my problems."
3445,I went to my therapist this morning and even sitting there I knew it wasn't going to be a good day.
3446,I thought once my pcs went away the anxiety would too but my therapist it's now a disorder caused by the pcs.
3447,So I started therapy and medication and am feeling much better about day to day stuff and feel like I could actually handle a relationship now.
3448,"i am a 23 year old male who has known about my anxiety and depression for YEARS, but only recently sought help (in the form of drug therapy as well as seeing a psychologist, which took a long long time to get myself to actually do)."
3449,Every time I talk to my therapist about what I think is a small victory she takes it and gives me the pat on my back I need to get some perspective.
3450,What can I do to try to calm down until I can see my doctor or a therapist again?
3451,"I thought about going back to seeing a therapist, but sometimes I it feels like I don't know where to start."
3452,"- I've been in therapy but due to changing economic circumstances I'm losing the insurance I had and will have to go onto a state-provided service similar to Medicaid, meaning I'm losing my current therapist."
3453,"It took me a while (months) to become comfortable with my current therapist and I don't know if I can go through that kind of process again, or if there are even resources available long-term that will allow me to work through this."
3454,I've expressed this to my therapist and she was concerned but it isn't something we've dealt with much at length.
3455,"I've tried a number of things in the past to deal with all of these problems, therapy, obviously; but also, anger management counseling and personal writing."
3456,Seeing a therapist is not an option for me so I'm looking for practical advice.
3457,I'm not in therapy yet but I should probably look into it and the reason I was asking about Zoloft in particular is because I have glaucoma and that can worsen on benzos.
3458,I made a commitment to go to therapy.
3459,I made another appointment the next day with a different therapist who I felt really really good about.
3460,"For once, I am not fearful of therapy tomorrow."
3461,"I know therapy can be terrifying, and you feel like it wont help, and that they will make you feel worse."
3462,"I haven't seen any doctors yet about anxiety - I used to visit a few therapists in university, but it was always short lived."
3463,"I just started therapy a few days ago and my therapist told me that I just can't give these thoughts meaning, which is helping a bit, I start CBT at the end of the month."
3464,"I've been struggling with severe anxiety-type stuff my whole life (not officially diagnosed yet, social anxiety, panic disorder, chronic depression, avoidant, something along those lines), but have only been in therapy since April."
3465,Both my therapist &amp; I agree a few weeks of inpatient would be good for me.
3466,"I did go talk to a therapist and was in group therapy for a little while, but had to end it."
3467,When the semester begins I will go back to therapy to get the much needed help.
3468,"I want to help him in any way I can, while also recognizing that I am not a therapist."
3469,"So, I had to reschedule my medicine check up, because my dad has cancer, so I told my therapist etc, about how I would run out of medicine before the next one."
3470,"I tried to avoid the meds, I even started having sessions (once per week) with a psychologist but 2 months later, yeah I could cope with some stuff but not everything and well, it got to the point where my therapist said ""You anxiety is out of control""."
3471,"I don't know what kind of therapy should I start working on, I mean, I have many options but I have to ask, there is a big language barrier for that kind of things in here and right now I am using Skype with a psychologist in my country, sadly because of this, I don't have much options either for a psychiatrist and psychologist."
3472,"I went to therapy for a while (during the period of this relationship) and it helped, but now due to my lack of income (I don't work enough hours), I can't afford it."
3473,"I've spoken to a few advisers in the school and even a therapist, but I feel like none of them have really helped much."
3474,I'm in therapy for this but it doesn't seem to be helping.
3475,Last therapy session when I had calmed down I realised that worrying won't do anything good for me.
3476,"No more endless therapy and self improvement, only to have a relapse and feel as crazy nuts as square 1!"
3477,Do I visit a therapist?
3478,Do I visit a therapist?
3479,"I am going to physical therapy, myofascial therapy, ultrasound sessions, doing relaxation exercises, eating right and trying to pace."
3480,"I am so overwhelmed, and have been seeing a therapist too and a psychiatrist."
3481,I get an hour a week to talk to my therapist and that's it.
3482,Should I share how I feel or is it best left to my therapist?
3483,"I went in to a therapist/psychologist (Not sure which, nor the difference) for depression, and got nothing from it."
3484,"I always assumed therapy would be super expensive, but after looking into my work's insurance plan, I've realized that it's entirely doable."
3485,"I made some calls and found a therapist who seems super friendly but super ready to call me on bullshit when it comes up (I saw a student counselor during college, and was turned off by the way I could pretty much tell her anything and she'd just sorta go with it)."
3486,"I suppose if you have any advice for someone starting therapy, I could use that."
3487,"Im the opposite since I have been to therapy, I talk myself through it."
3488,"I've sometimes been extremely stressed at the therapist's and have ""checked out"", experiencing mild to severe disassociation."
3489,I've seen a therapist and a psychiatrist once for a consult about medication.
3490,I haven't seen my friends in about two months since I have been recovering from unexpected knee surgery and physical therapy.
3491,"For ""everyday"" anxiety, im trying what my therapist and i call ""Operation Purling, Not Pills""."
3492,"I have a therapist, a relaxation therapist and am currently on 40mg of Fluoxetine a day (which is being revised in a week or so) however since seeking help I only feel worse."
3493,"My life is manageable, but I wouldn't say enjoyable, and I recently started seeing a therapist."
3494,Apparently it's all about exposure (and talk therapy).
3495,"I've been in therapy and am starting therapy again soon, but just need help in the meantime because it's really getting to me."
3496,"I found out about one thing, it is called ""exposure therapy""it is forcing yourself to talk to random strangers at the streets, I gave it a try and just after one week, my SAD completely gone, first time in my life I became so confident,social and outgoing person, I had possibility to be myself 100 percent, I thought that I finally ""transformed"" forever,but.. 4 months ago, I had serious panic attack and since then I got anxious from time to time for no reason, social events became very difficult to me in case that I was anxious in general, it wasn't unconfortable being around people,but I felt anxious forn no reason, so that made me to even isolate myself from going out for a while."
3497,I am freaking out about seeing a therapist.
3498,Btw I've tried therapy.
3499,"Cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness."
3500,7 years of therapy.
3501,I'm still trying to get into a therapist and I don't know when I'll get in.
3502,"I would like advice, but I'm not sure what I could do besides therapy."
3503,She has stated that she's going to find a therapist and consider going on medication.
3504,I started therapy a few months ago and it is the best investment of my life.
3505,"Oh, and I'm starting therapy tomorrow."
3506,"I DO feel like I currently need it on a daily basis, as demonstrated by the fact that I avoided going to a psych for medication for YEARS before finally agreeing with my therapist it was probably needed."
3507,"I'll think that I should go to the doctors and get diagnosed, or speak to a therapist or a counsellor, but the next day I feel OK, so I never pluck up the courage to just go."
3508,"My therapist, our mutual friends, and one of my best friends told me I need to tell him all of this and it's urgent...but I'm so scared."
3509,I have been seeing a therapist for a year now and family is getting pushy about it.
3510,My therapist wants me to continue making progress and wants to see me once a week while staying on my medication (a small dose anti-depressant which has really helped with my anxiety).
3511,My lunch break got moved for the first time in a couple of years and the day offs where I visit my therapist were pretty much taken away.
3512,"I panicked so much trying to reschedule my appointment with my therapist, seriously, I never realized how much rescheduling really messes me up."
3513,There are actually a lot of studies on it and it's considered a safe alternative therapy for anxiety and depression.
3514,"Edit: Also, I do see a therapist."
3515,About a year ago I was seeing a therapist about my problem and taking meds.
3516,I'm going back to therapy Wednesday but I still have to make it through the next 3 nights.
3517,"Hi there, 

I have suffered from severe generalized anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember and have been taking medication and receiving therapy for a few years now."
3518,I'm medicated and in therapy.
3519,Exposure therapy by myself is difficult... Everyone thinks I'm doing so well.
3520,"There is still a copay, though, and I don't make much money, so I want to know ahead of time: does any sort of non-medical therapy work for this particular issue?"
3521,"She has a decent therapist, but occasional appointments don't seem to be much help, and she is reluctant to seek other treatments or help because of the expense and further anxiety that this causes."
3522,I've had three therapists in the last 5 years and have noticed each have a tick which indicates to me they are bored by my presence/observations/conversation.
3523,Should I bring this up with my therapist?
3524,She has gone to see a couple of therapists (non Dr.) recently and hasn't gotten any guidance on medication.
3525,My therapist mentioned a medication that wouldn't make me sick six years ago but I stopped going to that particular office and google hasn't been much help.
3526,"I was meant to start therapy, though I never got the chance to go because I couldn't find a way to get there."
3527,I've been in trauma therapy and marriage therapy.
3528,I want some more testing done and I also want to see a therapist but my parents are now getting annoyed and angry at me.
3529,"And I hate always bringing up that she needs to see a therapist or medication, because it was leads to her saying, I can’t take that medicine because it gives you parkinsons, and I can’t take that one it has this side effect and that one."
3530,And none of the therapists she’s been to before helped according to her.
3531,"Like all she has to say is, I want help, lets go see this doctor or that one or go here to take to this therapist, and I’m all aboard for anything."
3532,"And it’s not like this every day, some of it is but it’s manageable, but sometimes it just gets to where we need to discuss it and she gets so emotional and frustrated and the mention of therapy just sends her to another level of anxiety."
3533,"
Dear fellow sufferers, 
           I've entered a relapse of my anxiety and just started therapy again today."
3534,I currently see a psychriatrist/therapist and I'm worried that I'm being self centered in doing so.
3535,"Personally I feel pretty terrible about myself in many different aspects (constant anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, etc) but whenever I see my therapist it seems as if she feels like I'm not really that sick."
3536,I will be seeing a therapist on my school campus once uni starts back up again in the hopes of some CBT.
3537,"I'm back on my meds, and waited three months to see my therapist."
3538,I also haven't gotten far enough with them to know if it will be a good therapist/client relationship.
3539,I just started anxiety and panic therapy about a month ago.
3540,I have been seeing a therapist who specializes in this and we have made some progress.
3541,But the doctor asked me lots of questions calmly and gave me two options; psychotherapy or medication.
3542,"Lastly, I go to therapy for this (covered by my university) but I can't afford sexual therapy... although I would really like it, it's just way too expensive for me."
3543,"Soooo I was diagnosed with pretty bad anxiety bad in March, in May I started taking citalopram (20mg/day) and starting doing cognitive behavioural therapy."
3544,I've never been on medication or seen a therapist.
3545,"So after struggling with my anxiety for nearly 10 years and panic attacks for a good portion of that, I finally was convinced by a friend to try therapy."
3546,I wanted to ask if anyone else experienced these sort of feelings going to therapy for the first time.
3547,"I also wanted to encourage anyone who is considering therapy, but is hesitant and afraid, to go for it."
3548,tl;dr: Made myself go to my first therapy appointment.
3549,"I'm a college student who did almost a year of therapy combined with 60 mgs of Prozac, and kind of just abruptly stopped both when the latter stopped working so well (though thinking about it, it might just be because I stopped taking it reliably) and I felt okay without it."
3550,"I exchanged one email with my therapist that said to call her to schedule an appointment after summer break and predictably, face with the need for a phone call, never did."
3551,"I'm starting to feel like I can really benefit from returning to therapy and medication, but being untreated, I'm very, very anxious about returning, largely because I left without notice last time."
3552,I don't exactly have much time to devote to therapy either...
3553,"I know going back would be best for me but I have so little time and am so scared of how my therapist will react to me again and what to do and how to catch up and... just... you guys kind of get how I'm feeling, I'm sure."
3554,"tl;dr left therapy abruptly, need it again, too anxious to return."
3555,I'm leaning toward seeing a therapist through my insurance because I am getting to the point where I am unable to function properly.
3556,I've been in therapy but I feel like it's gotten worse since starting nursing school.
3557,"My therapist kept pushing me to get out, to do volunteer work or get a job."
3558,"I don't have the courage/guts/whatever to ask her to recommend a therapist so my insurance will cover it, but I know that's where I need to go."
3559,I can't even talk to my therapist about my problems even though I know he just wants to help.
3560,Isn't that why we got you a therapist?
3561,"He was able to stabilise through therapy and medication, and has been developing coping strategies since."
3562,"About a year ago, he stopped taking medication (it made him feel dissociative all the time) and has been controlling his anxiety mainly through exercise and thoughts strategies he picked up during therapy."
3563,My therapist thinks I may be experiencing it.
3564,"My counsellor has suggested that I try group therapy, which I'm really worried about."
3565,"**What is group therapy like, with anxiety?"
3566,"Age: 22 M
Current Meds: Zoloft
Previously prescribed: Xanax, Ativan, and Paxil
Psychiatrist diagnosis: Social Anxiety Disorder
Therapy: No therapy, only been once and left with little hope that it would help me."
3567,I was prescribed with Sertraline (50mg) and my doctor has made an appointment for me to go to therapy.
3568,I've also gone to Psychologist from time to time to work on cognitive behavioral therapy.
3569,"Currently I'm towards the higher level of medication that my doctor normally prescribes, and I'm doing my best to practice the things I've learned in therapy, but I'm still having some anxiety, and now depression."
3570,"Wife is frustrated with me, parents are starting to cry when I talk I them and therapist is suggesting some big life changes that make me really nervous."
3571,I've been talking to my therapist about ping back to school/changing fields but how can I really believe in myself?
3572,"I have this book from my therapist awhile back and it's for as the title obviously states, ""managing your anxiety and panic"" through CBT."
3573,"**  (you can search for scientific articles at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=cognitive%20behavioral%20therapy)

 At their core, both approaches theorize that your **emotions are caused by your thoughts."
3574,I've only really gotten therapy for sensory stuff which helps a lot and if I forget to do that I'll go oncomputer more.
3575,I see a psychiatrist and a therapist once a month.
3576,"I am currently in therapy, and realized I have pretty bad depression and anxiety that manifests itself into anger and paranoia."
3577,"I'm aware that this is probably frequently asked, but what I'm asking for is basically an elaboration on seeing a therapist for the first time."
3578,My friends believe I have anxiety and could benefit from meds and/or therapy.
3579,"However, I am willing to go to a therapist to see if they think I actually have anxiety."
3580,"Basically, I don't know what I would tell a therapist."
3581,TL;DR: What exactly do therapists need to know at your first appointment?
3582,"Assuming that I will remember nothing when I'm actually talking to the therapist, what all should I have written down beforehand?"
3583,"Yes, I am in therapy haha."
3584,I've been diagnosed with bad anxiety disorder and have been in and out of therapy and on meds for years.
3585,I know how addictive benzos are and am going to talk about my dependence with my new therapist.
3586,We both got puppies to train as therapy dogs...
3587,"After seeing my college's therapist for a few weeks, she prescribed Lexapro."
3588,And I honestly am not sure how this therapy is going to help.
3589,I feel like I can talk myself out of it but perhaps just having someone listen and speak back who i know I won't hurt or lose (unless this therapist gets sick of me) will do me good.
3590,"And thus, I'm finally going to seek therapy."
3591,"So if I don't open up completely then the psychologist won't know the full extent of my depression/anxiety, the therapy won't be as effective."
3592,I'm looking for a therapist but have yet to find one that works and is covered by my insurance.
3593,Do you have a therapist you can call or something when you are freaking out?
3594,"I've been getting help from my therapist and I'm really trying to stop putting everyone else before helping myself, but the toxic environment is crushing any morsel of progress I make."
3595,"Because of this, I have been trying to gain the courage to call my University therapist to get help."
3596,"I need therapy ,but my anxiety is preventing me from defeating it."
3597,Maybe without meds or talking with a therapist.
3598,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
3599,"I battled through it for a couple of months before seeing a therapist, who I did *not* click with at all and never went back."
3600,"My experience (and a limited amount of therapy) suggest to me that the problem is mostly in my patterns of thought, and must be addressed there."
3601,I know I should probibly try therapy but I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced a similar breathing problem.
3602,"I was diagnosed with generalized depression and anxiety (iirc) a few years ago, but I stopped going to the therapist because I always felt worse after seeing her."
3603,"Everyone tells her to take antianxiety meds, including her therapist, but she is incredibly against taking meds."
3604,"I've only ever had two panic attacks, one about a year and a half ago and one a month or so ago and I was like 'surely I don't have anxiety, it's just fresher nerves' but it's got to the point where I have been back to my doctor several times about it and been put on the waiting list for therapy and been prescribed meds and I'm scared."
3605,I have two phone calls in to two different therapists/groups and they haven't called me back yet.
3606,"Alright so quick history story on my anxiety;

*  **Age:** 25
*  **Gender:** Female
*  **Anxiety/PTSD issues since:** around 15 years of age
*  **PTSD/Anxiety panic disorder/ Agoraphobia medically diagnosed:** Yes, by 2 therapists and a Psychiatrist
*  **Thought causes of my PTSD/Anxiety crap:** They believe it's from my abusive childhood (Mental and physical) and a 2 year long ""rape""/forced sexual abuse from my first boyfriend when I was 14 1/2 to 17 years old."
3607,"I think with a little medical help again, and maybe another try with therapy , I might be able to work again within the year."
3608,I have been improving my anxiety with therapy and have become a lot more confident recently.
3609,the article went on to discuss how this is not talked about enough in therapist/client relationships and the whole mental health community in general.
3610,"today me and my therapist talked about how a huge issue with me is that i give control of my thoughts and my self to those around me, allowing myself to think that they are judging me."
3611,"well, my therapist suggested when i start feeling that loss of control to have a visual connected to it."
3612,"After being in therapy for a couple of weeks, my therapist helped make an appointment to a psychiatrist to get on the right med combinations."
3613,I've been to therapy and she says I need to keep myself busy.
3614,"It's frustrating because I have had so much time to get over this, and I've been doing all the right things (therapy, meds, exercise, diet, work, etc), but I feel like I'm exactly where I was when I was with him."
3615,"My therapist told me it's because I might see a bit of myself in him and ultimately start seeing myself as somebody that can be replaced with a ""better, new-improved"" version of a guy."
3616,"I got out and tried seeing the therapists I did before the hospital, but they stopped seeing me because they coudln't help me and I ""wasn't traumatized enough."""
3617,"I've been diagnosed by a GP and sent to a therapist for therapy for general anxiety, and although things didn't work out with my therapist, one thing he pointed out multiple times is that I am abnormally more empathetic than most."
3618,I saw a therapist two days ago and we really talked over just what I'm dealing with.
3619,Blood tests all have come back great and even the therapist said this is a reaction of stress/anxiety.
3620,I'm even wondering if maybe this is something I can conquer without therapy.
3621,I was given a few sessions of therapy after finding that drugs didn't help.
3622,"I once read in a book about cognitive behavioral therapy that the best decisions are those that are based on rational, considered judgments."
3623,I asked them if I could start seeing a therapist so they got me an appointment with the doctor on Monday (next week) so I could get referred to a therapist.
3624,"When I first started therapy we briefly touched on the subject of some medications, nothing in particular just basically that it can affect libido but that it sometimes is a necessary boost to important chemicals within the brain."
3625,I've had several months of therapy now and had made a little progress but some recent challenges have had me fall back into my old ways of severe procrastination  and rapidly declining self esteem.
3626,I have an appointment with my therapist on Thursday and I think we are going to explore some options for medication.
3627,"I go see a therapist once a week, my next visit will be the 4th time I have gone."
3628,"I'm kinda afraid that this will never go away, so should I see a therapist or something?"
3629,I talked to a therapist and it didn't really help.
3630,"I see a therapist, but I still have so many problems."
3631,TL;DR: I don't know what to do with myself and I can't get in to see a therapist for 2 months.
3632,"And every day I'm asking myself if I feel normal right now or not, which just reminds me of the issues I'm having which causes anxiety and then I end up taking another xanax which makes me wonder if I'll have enough to last until I can see a therapist and if i'm taking too much (I'm not dosage wise, i think the most in one day so far has been three."
3633,I have since completed cognitive behavioral therapy to deal with the PTSD and take 100mg Zoloft under the care of my PCP for my anxiety and depression.
3634,"I'm able to use the tools/techniques I learned in therapy to, for the most part, qualm my checkbook panic."
3635,It would explain why I react somewhat averse to some of the ideas my therapist comes up with on how I can handle anxious situations.
3636,I just don't really know where to o from here (next therapy appointment is a little away)
3637,"Other than that, I do not take medication and don't plan to because I am sure that I can control this with a bit of reluctant therapy."
3638,I thought it might be a muslce knot or something but my massage therapist friend couldnt find one.
3639,I'm in the process of getting help from a therapist.
3640,I've tried so many medications and I'm bad at therapy.
3641,"I'm willing to try therapy again, and also looking for an opinion from a second (well, third I guess) psychiatrist."
3642,"(Side note haven't thrown up since I was 4, so it was a new territory and still is to this day)
I've come a really long way with therapy and a psychiatrist."
3643,I believe my sister should be going to therapy at the least and that part of her illness is not wanting to get help.
3644,"Frankly, I hate therapy."
3645,"I've suffered from depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, and had several psychiatrists/therapists in the past."
3646,Have you had success with therapy?
3647,"I'm beginning therapy to help build a foundation to deal with my anxiety in the future, but I never realized until today how your own thoughts will dictate your perception of existence."
3648,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
3649,"Started up with psychodynamic therapy, should I just stick with that and avoid drugs until I get the chance to experience any effects of the therapy alone?"
3650,"I've worked through less severe varieties of these problems a few years back through attending therapy, but this time around it's way worse than before, and I'm rendered an anxious mess whenever I run into an uncomfortable situation that sets off the vicious spiral of anxiety --&gt; worried I'll get anxious again --&gt; more anxiety and so on and so forth."
3651,I just started psychodynamic therapy last week.
3652,"It's not very difficult for me to speak openly about my issues, but my therapist said it would probably be beneficial for me to start taking some kind of medication so I could get a break from the anxiety while I start sorting through my issues in therapy."
3653,Should I try and overcome my fear of SSRI side-effects and take the drug; rely on therapy alone; or discuss other types of medication with my doctor?
3654,I would ask my therapist but he's out of town and thinking about this is making it hard to work.
3655,I'm studying Radiation therapy and I have a year and a half until I graduate.
3656,"I don't know how to tell them I'm not better, I want to go back into therapy this summer, and go on medication, and continue to work on my mental health."
3657,"After that I saw several therapists, was put on medication (Xanax and several others), and was generally miserable."
3658,"I started seeing my old therapist about this, but she was only able to give me advice on redirecting my thoughts and blocking the panic ones, which only helped if my anxiety was 7 out of 10 or lower."
3659,The reason I'm making this post is because I've been trying different therapy and self help methods to overcome fears like this.
3660,"I tried deep breathing and all of my other techniques that I've learned from therapy and what not, but I'm just very stuck, and I don't know what to do."
3661,I've looked at CBT... but nobody in my family thinks I should go to therapy.
3662,I saw my therapist last week and she said I'm definitely showing signs of high anxiety and the beginning of depression too.
3663,How did you build up to talking to a therapist?
3664,I don't know if she's had any therapy since we've been apart.
3665,The recruiting lady said i need to get a letter from my therapist and the doctor who diagnosed me with depression to gain medical clearance.
3666,"My therapist says that it is best to just experience it, that fighting or trying to control it will only give my anxiety more power."
3667,"Went to my first therapist appointment and was told I'm suffering from ""worry attacks""."
3668,"So I had a breakdown, wound up on anti-depressants (again) and back in therapy."
3669,"The therapy has really helped, and lately I've been doing swimmingly."
3670,I am in therapy but I just started with a new person and I'm still getting to know her so it hasn't helped much just yet.
3671,I am already in therapy but is there anything else I can do?
3672,"I'm looking into therapy, but I need to be able to cope before then."
3673,"But over the past year I have finally gotten it down to a mild level threw a mix of therapy, drugs, exercise, and a daily schedule."
3674,"Finally after a month I quit, but I feel like a let my Mom down who has been paying for my meds and therapy."
3675,My therapist and I have worked on some things - including mindfullness meditation- and some of those things have helped.
3676,"I do have anxiety and have had cognitive behavioral therapy for it in the past, which helped for a while."
3677,I see a therapist at my college but because I'm on vacation right now I won't be having a session with her until 2 weeks.
3678,"I don't meet with a real psychiatrist or therapist until later this month, but the counselor gave me this link - www.e-couch.anu.edu.au - it's an Australian program that's free, kind of CBTish."
3679,"I am in therapy, but am not on any medications."
3680,"I have gone through the a-z in therapists and therapy, i've done bio and nuero feedback I take medication and finally landed my first job."
3681,I've talk to a few therapists and tell them about the horrible experiences i've had with the medications and that i refuse to take them.
3682,Talk therapy has been helping me enough up until now.
3683,"I am currently in between therapists because of insurance issues, but I should be starting with someone the first week of september."
3684,"I keep it fairly under control most of the time now, thanks to therapy and medication, but there are moments of intense anxiety that I still experience."
3685,"i dont trust my GP to prescribe me, i barely trusted this guy after 2 years of intensive therapy and he just dropped me."
3686,Two weeks ago I got a therapist and I have been working with them and given tools to help further manage.
3687,I will be looking for a therapist this upcoming week.
3688,I just discovered the concept of ESAs today and I'm going to talk to my therapist about it when I see her next week.
3689,Would they accept documentation from a talk therapist?
3690,I tried hypnotherapy but it didn't do much.
3691,I saw a therapist and got it somewhat under control.
3692,I have been in therapy and on medication for a long time and thought I had it pretty well under control.
3693,"Within the last 6 months I've made huge headway with my depression, stopped seeing a therapist, and weened off the generic zoloft."
3694,I see a therapist for my anxiety and she advised me to adopt a phrase to say to myself (in my head or aloud) when I'm nervous or on the verge of an attack to kind of talk myself down.
3695,Do I go to my regular doctor?or do I need to talk to a therapist of some sort?
3696,I was working as an massage therapist for the last five years and I just hate it.
3697,"I have found myself in a bit of a catch-22: My anxiety is so high that my therapist strongly recommends medication so that I can effectively engage in therapy, however my anxiety is so high that I'm afraid of starting a new medication."
3698,Can you give me resources and guidelines on how to start Cognitive Behavioral Therapy without having to go to a therapist as I am a medical student and I absolutely have no time for that.
3699,I've been seeing my therapist for over a year now.
3700,"I think it's time for a fresh start with someone new, but I don't know how to gracefully end my relationship with this therapist."
3701,"I know the root cause for my anxiety is this and I've spoken to therapists about it a lot 

My family generally are very selfish people, my mum is unsupportive too and I've never been able to talk to any of them properly about anything so I feel mega alone... Its always about them and I can't get a word in edgeways.."
3702,Been in therapy too but no real breakthroughs.
3703,"this weekend i took a true test of my anxiety and went on a trip to las vegas and went to a bunch of shows and out to eat, all these things would normally give me terrible anxiety but thanks to posting on here (and therapy of course lol) i was able to keep it all under control, so thank you everyone in the sub-reddit"
3704,"Hey, I was just wondering if anyone would be willing to share some of the exercises their therapist/counselor/psychologist has given to them and what they involve/and are supposed to achieve."
3705,I'm just looking for some more relaxation/concentration/grounding exercises to practice in my own time so i can talk to my therapist about their effectiveness for me.
3706,have an appointment tommorow with my therapist.
3707,I constantly feel the physical symptoms of GAD and I am actively trying therapy and medicine however I'm wondering what it is doing for my health.
3708,"I wish I had more money to continue therapy, but its so damn expensive."
3709,"Through therapy and meds I got through that, began to believe I was invincible and over the next 4 years I went to college and then University, my life was on the up, I made great friends and fell in love."
3710,"I was referred, at first, to a therapist who tried counselling for the anxiety, although this helped and got me out of the house, it wasn't till I was referred to a therapist for CBT that I really started to make progress."
3711,"I have listened and learnt so much from my therapist, taken on all the advice and help she could have given me."
3712,"I have severe panic disorder, with depression and OCD with health phobias (not hypochondria, which helped me so much when my old therapist explained it)."
3713,"I've been out of therapy (looking for one now) but I've been too multiple, including one that was considered a top psychotherapist globally."
3714,I said it was still bad and I was seeking a therapist.
3715,I told her three therapists had all told me no med would help me and would make me worse.
3716,"She just kept being dismissive and bitchy, and she's a nurse practitioner, not even a doctor, definitely not a psychotherapist."
3717,I told I would happily tame meds except every therapist so far has said no.
3718,I started seeing a therapist and a counselor and was put on Prozac (generic) and Ativan (generic).
3719,"They drugged him up so bad that when his therapist suggested writing letters to us to help explain what he was going through, I didn't call him ""Dad."""
3720,"He's gotten a lot better and is only on one medication, plus his monthly therapist visits."
3721,"My work insurance only covers 5 therapist visits a year before it becomes solely out of pocket and on a teacher salary, that's a ton of money."
3722,And medication of any sort is no substitute for therapy or making changes to current thinking patterns/behavioral patterns.
3723,"I have seen several therapists, I'm on Zoloft (new - recently on effexor) and Klonopin."
3724,I've been on every drug and therapy that has been thrown at me.
3725,"He leaves the fixing it for the therapist, and I'm actually grateful for that."
3726,I started going to therapy my freshman year after a complete breakdown where I finally told my mom how I had been feeling.
3727,I started seeing a therapist and after the first session I started lying.
3728,"Just not my happy place)

Last year I decided was a fresh new start and I would see a therapist, and be honest and really get some help."
3729,"This therapist would constantly question why I was crying, and I know that's probably part of the job but most of the time I don't know what causes my crying and whenever she would ask I just would either sit in silence or make up a bullshit answer."
3730,My therapist had cancelled a few sessions in a row and I just faded out from seeing her.
3731,"I would like to start seeing a therapist again, but it would have to be in the same office as my last therapist and that is terror inducing."
3732,What do I do or say if I see my old therapist?
3733,I want to go back to therapy but I might run into an old therapist I didn't like and stopped going to without warning.
3734,"If it helps, I have been diagnosed with moderate OCD by a therapist a couple years back."
3735,"I start community college in a week or two and I'm not to nervous about that, but despite seeing two therapists during these weeks that I haven't been at school, I still haven't been able to have sleepovers."
3736,"As a side note I am taking medications and seeing a therapist, and they are helping me wonderfully."
3737,"I am currently waiting for cognitive therapy classes later in the week on Tuesday or Wednesday and I am still so scared of the world and all of this anxiety has built up over the course of months; my mom was talking to me about living on my own just in case something happens to her, she found someone online she liked in Arkansas and wants to move there in the upcoming years, due to me having severe GAD that I was good at keeping out of my thoughts for a while; found the cracks, and all of the worries and anxieties started seeping in: ""what happens if mom gets in an accident?"""
3738,"I have a therapist, a psychologist, and some decent friends at the place I work, its a non-profit film organization that matches high school kids with professionals in the field."
3739,It's shit like this that drives me into therapy in the first fucking place.
3740,"I have been off the therapist's couch for years now, and off my meds for the same - I thought I was better."
3741,"I'm looking for a therapist, but money is tight and it's another expense I'm afraid we can't afford."
3742,My therapist says to walk into any panic attacks I might come across.
3743,I've been avoiding the medication route for a while and I've been thinking of going back to therapy but I just find it odd that I can feel fine for an hour or so and all of a sudden I'm flooded with a few seconds of anxiety and panic.
3744,"I've seen my therapist twice in the last week and at our last appointment she suggested that I see her husband for a treatment called [Neurolink](http://www.neurolinkglobal.com/), which she felt might help with my anxiety and panic attacks."
3745,I'm considering dumping her and finding a therapist who does cognitive behavioral therapy but I'm a little concerned about doing this in the middle of having a crisis.
3746,I've been seeing a therapist weekly for over 3 months for anxiety.
3747,"Both my anxiety and ADHD symptoms have been making my life difficult, but I've had trouble getting ahold of a therapist that understands both."
3748,I'm afraid a new therapist would be worse.
3749,"Maybe I should be more patient with my current therapist, but I feel like that's a gamble."
3750,"**TL;DR- I'm afraid a new therapist would be worse,  uncertain whether I should remain patient with current therapist, and have no clue how I'd tell my therapist I want to stop seeing her."
3751,"So, I was going to the therapist at my old college for a while but now I go to a school that doesn't have a clinic."
3752,I'm looking for a new therapist right now.
3753,The problem is... the therapist at my old school asked me on 2 separate occasions if I have been diagnosed with Asperger's.
3754,"Anyway, pretty soon I'll be going to a new therapist."
3755,i know i need to see someone but the thought of talking to someone like a therapist gives me even more anxiety to where i dont do it.
3756,I scheduled an appointment with my doctor for Monday because I may just give in and start medication and therapy like he suggested.
3757,I've been in therapy and support groups for this since I was 16 and I know just how much they help.
3758,I have a life coach therapist that i don't see often so i dont think i could go more days now.
3759,"I tried to get help through the school, but they just told me they'd send me a list of therapists and never did."
3760,"You don't need to tell me to see a counsellor or therapist because I am currently seeing one, I just do not have the courage to bring this up yet."
3761,I have my very first appointment with a therapist today.
3762,"I figured, with an appointment with the therapist today, I would be anxious as hell."
3763,My psychologist says that medicine and therapy are not needed anymore in my case which I am thankful for.
3764,"I began medicinal therapy with a psychiatrist about a year ago, and I am prescribed Paxil, Ativan and Clonazepam."
3765,"I know a lot of you will suggest ""take different meds,""  maybe ""find a new therapist,"" and of course, I will stop taking these things safely and under supervision... 

What I am really looking for are ways/techniques you might have for lessening severe anxiety?"
3766,"For some, medication is a great way to get a handle on it, for others, it may be some sort of therapy."
3767,(I have a therapist but my next appointment isn't until 3/20)
3768,"I have already made an appointment with a CBT therapy thing, but that isn't for a few weeks and I need something that will take away the panic in the moment."
3769,I've circled the therapists' door 4 or 5 times and one time my coworker even saw me pacing nervously there...
3770,They told me to go to therapy so I did.
3771,"They told me to go to **group** therapy, so I did."
3772,"I had social anxiety and what I can say that it is quite embarassing, but I sucessfully overcame it with exposure therapy,my social skills was improved dramatically.. Until the day I had panic attack, since then I have general anxiety disorder, now it is weird situation,because I can be anxious most of the time like everywhere, but I don't feel uncofortable or awkward around people, just expressing my thoughts and making conversations became difficult, like my mind gone blank or something, it is pretty annoying."
3773,There are therapists at the school all the time and I see my therapist almost daily.
3774,"I have a therapist at school who I have seen a few times, but my parents have no idea about it."
3775,It's really not healthy for me to divulge my mental health issues to them because they are major contributors to my problems at home and have expressed that me seeing a therapist would just be an easy way out.
3776,"They have not supported the idea of me trying to find some answers to my problems through therapy, and I think it would be a major misstep to involve them yet again in such a low point of my life."
3777,"My therapist has even expressed that if I was interested, she could set me up to pursue that route."
3778,"I've been seeing a therapist the last few weeks, she's someone I used to see back when I was in college."
3779,So I finially talked to my mom and made an appointment with a therapist with the condition that we don't tell my dad (after I put it off for almost 2 months because he wont leave me alone).
3780,I have been seeing a therapist for 3 months.
3781,"Background: I've been doing the anxiety/depression tango for about 10 years, with meds &amp; therapy &amp; the whole shebang, &amp; as of about a year ago I felt like I got to a good place."
3782,And I'm really worried I'll be told to get therapy.
3783,None of my doctors or the Psychiatrists ever suggested this could be a side-effect and it was always treated with additional medication or therapy.
3784,"No drugs have helped significantly, I've been through therapy multiple times, and tried the self help route."
3785,This all happens with drug therapy and talk therapy or CBT.
3786,"Yesterday, I was turned down for Ativan by my med provider (separate from my therapist), but given Propanolol."
3787,I'm finally starting to feel better and can open up with my therapist while on Abilify and Ciprolex.
3788,"I'm seeing a cbt therapist, gone on two sessions so far and it feels good to be able to talk about the problem but I don't see this ever ending."
3789,"I don't know why I do it, I started general therapy earlier this year and was put on generic Prozac for depression and anxiety."
3790,I'm going to see my therapist on the 17th but really I just wish he understood more.
3791,I am seeing my therapist tonight.
3792,"I'm in therapy right now, but haven't seen my doctor for a month and a half or so."
3793,"The first, Mindshift, is a sort of condensed, portable cognitive behavioral therapy aimed at 7 of the most common problems people with anxiety have, e.g."
3794,Obviously not a substitute for real therapy if anxiety is seriously interfering in your daily functioning.
3795,"Two SSRIs, heavy dosage of benzos, seroquel (both regular to sleep and SR daytime), multiple group therapies, followed closely by a psychiatrist, a psychologist, an ergotherapist, a nurse and a specialized educator."
3796,Her doctors are good and they're doing alot - she has resources like a 24/7 hotline and therapists coming to her home weekly.
3797,I want to help beyond what the system can provide and I wonder often if there's therapies outside Canada that can address the biological axis better than how we do it here.
3798,"It can't be behavioral therapy because frankly that option has been exhausted, just as commonly prescribed medication has been."
3799,I'm thinking more along the lines of experimental biological therapy.
3800,"My step-mom recommended hypnotherapy, but I don't know what effect a hypnotherapist can have in 30 days."
3801,I was lucky enough to get a very good therapist from the start.
3802,She was close to my age (early thirties...close compared to a lot of therapists I've had) and she never failed to make me feel better.
3803,I'd been out of town for two weeks prior to the cancellations so I'd gone without a therapist for a month.
3804,"And it's happening to my therapist, the person who could help me."
3805,"All I can picture is my therapist, young and thriving, being told about cancer."
3806,I haven't had therapy for a month.
3807,"My...old therapist said that she'd get me into another therapist specifically for OCD and related disorders, but there's a long waiting list."
3808,Is exposure therapy the only thing?
3809,I go to regular therapy and take daily medication for all of this but I'm still just overwhelmed.
3810,"Instead of thinking “I’m dying” during a panic attack, a CBT approach would be “I know this feels terrible, but it’s just a panic attack and I am going to be okay.” I didn’t go for any sessions with a therapist, although if this is something you think will help you I say go for it, because I’ve heard incredible success stories."
3811,"I need therapy and used to go to it, but then I lost health insurance coverage."
3812,Should I start going to therapy?
3813,"Since then, after multiple psychiatrists (paxil 30 mg) and therapists have tried their hand at helping me, I am still stuck in a cycle."
3814,"My therapist took it upon herself to write me a medical release note for me for that week, stating that it is in everyone's best interest if I am allowed a day off (if not two) in the middle of the week."
3815,Any suggestions on medication or therapy?
3816,"I don't have any personal or family history of mental health conditions, other than maybe some very minor attention deficit which I've been able to motivate myself through without medication or therapy."
3817,"I just don't want to go in the office and look like some kid trying to walk in and pick up some Xanax, which I'm afraid they'll be suspicious of if I turn down SSRIs and therapy."
3818,I am going to a therapist soon.
3819,I don't have a therapist.
3820,"I was still off meds and therapy, but surprisingly it didn't effect me like it should have."
3821,I started going to therapy and they put me on Paxil.
3822,"I thought getting a job to pay for therapy or getting insurance would help, so I applied a bunch of places."
3823,I don't have the money for therapy.
3824,"And he says he's afraid that if he goes to a therapist, they'll just tell him they can't help him."
3825,Neither of us has ever been to therapy before and it scares us both.
3826,"If you've gone to therapy, how did you build up the courage to make the first call or visit?"
3827,I can't afford therapy because I don't earn a lot of money.
3828,"I've tried therapy, but all my therapist did was try to get me to do CBT, breathing exercises, and rationalize my anxiety, all of which I already do without it helping (part of what makes me anxious is that I DO realize it's irrational and still can't do anything about it."
3829,"I have no idea if this is something that could be helped with therapy, or even where I'd go to find a therapist."
3830,"I should add, I have an appointment for a therapist this week and I am currently on zoloft 50mg"
3831,"I've only done two weeks of therapy, and after that I could not afford it."
3832,"I'm scared I'll need to have another surgery, I'm scared I won't be able to have the option of having kids, I'm scared I have cancer or some other horrible disease, I'm scared of needing to take hormone replacement therapy."
3833,"do i seek a therapist first, and have him recommend me to a doctor?"
3834,I've also kind of become averse to going to therapy as well.
3835,I've had a lot of issues finding a therapist I even like and it's such an excruciating process to go through when searching for one anyway.
3836,I haven't seen a therapist since I was a child and even then I'm not sure how to go about doing that.
3837,"Sometimes it gets too much and try to persuade her to try therapy, which I know is not helpful."
3838,"I'm in therapy and he knows I'm trying, but it seems like my efforts are always in vain because I still manage to lose my temper over completely trivial things."
3839,"He saw a therapist earlier this week, but he isn't a huge fan of him."
3840,I'd rather try therapy but my Dr. seems to think the med is the best way to go.
3841,I'm no way doubting my Dr. but why wouldn't therapy be recommended first over medication?
3842,I'm just curious if seeing a therapist would be a good option for me.
3843,"As far as my situation goes, I'm already seeing all the doctors and therapists I need."
3844,"I haven't discussed this with my therapist yet, because I feel pretty dumb about it, but I've been dating my boyfriend for almost a year now, and I still have days where I wake up (sometimes at his apartment!"
3845,"I have been to see a couple different doctors and therapists, but they weren't very helpful."
3846,"I'm not going currently, but in the recent past I went to therapy for a few years and as a result I've gotten fairly good at self-realizing what is wrong with my thinking."
3847,"OK, a few things up front; Yep, I have a therapist, and I'm going to see her on Monday."
3848,I also see a therapist.
3849,"*Fuck you* you're a fucking therapist you're supposed to help me with my dysphoria, not make it worse."
3850,"After about two years on Zoloft and Lexapro at any one time, I consulted another psychologist, this time a more therapy-oriented one than the previous doctor who told me that because anxiety/depression is caused by chemical imbalances, it should be rectified using medication."
3851,We talked A LOT -- his therapy was psychodynamic in nature (i.e.
3852,I am getting on an SSRI next week and I am talking with my therapist this week.
3853,"Lately, he hasn't been going to therapy or to class and is either staying up until 8AM playing games or wanting me to drive him around until he feels some relief."
3854,"I see a CBT therapist every two weeks and was thinking I should just wait and tell her but I know when it comes to it I'll be too scared to tell her the story, I'm just frightened and I can't get my head straight."
3855,He has learned to work with his anxiety due to my mother's amazing support and some very high quality therapy work.
3856,"I'm already set up to see a Psychiatrist and a therapist, but I'm curious, could my mental health issues REALLY be causing all of the problems I'm feeling?"
3857,"I honestly just don't know where else to ask, and my therapist doesn't have any clue what's going on either, so I figured I'd just post here and see if anyone has any clue what I'm talking about."
3858,My therapist is not sure what else to try.
3859,"I think I maybe have to cancel therapy for thursday because it's really far away and I can't drive there

And I dont know what to do about my prefectiption I was supposed to oick up today becusw the pharmacy is also really far."
3860,"I'm really close with my Spanish teacher however, and my therapist knows that and told me I should tell her."
3861,"Also the evenings and mornings are far worse, I know about SAD and light therapy."
3862,I started therapy at the end of the summer this year.
3863,"My therapist is awesome, she's really understanding, and she's helped."
3864,"I can't afford therapy anymore, and the sessions my work was paying for have run out."
3865,"I almost wish I had never gone to therapy because I hate life so fucking much since I was told it's not depression, it's anxiety."
3866,The cognitive therapy?
3867,I'd been working with a behavioral therapist and learned to sit with the emotions without trying to change them.
3868,I'm on a huge waiting list for a therapist and tomorrow I'm going to call my doctor and try to get an appointment so he can put me on some meds but that's all I can do and all I want to do is talk to someone but I have no one I can talk to.
3869,I am seeing a therapist and it helps me a little but I am still suffering a lot.
3870,Do you think a therapist could help me?
3871,I have already tried everything except therapy and medication.
3872,Take medication only if you're considering retraining your mind through CBT/meditation/exposure therapy.
3873,"I know I should probably just call someone, find a therapist and go but that whole process hits me and I don't want to do it."
3874,"** 

I don't have insurance, so a doctor/therapist is not in my immediate future."
3875,I don't have a therapist and I haven't been in therapy for years.
3876,I'd rather see a regular doctor before a therapist for some reason.
3877,A therapist?
3878,He didn’t refer me to a therapist or anything.
3879,"My boyfriend helps me out a lot when things like this happen, but I don’t want to have to rely on him and I don’t want to be prescribed any sort of medication either, which is why I haven’t tried to see a therapist."
3880,I need something for now until I can work through this with therapy.
3881,"I have an appointment with a guy that does CBT and EMDR and schema therapy, but that's also not for a while and I have no idea what to do in the meantime."
3882,Would literally skip therapy because of panic attacms.
3883,I even stopped seeing my therapist.
3884,"No meds, no therapist to talk to, obviously going to a friend is not an option, but I am still upset and crying."
3885,"Yes, I'm seeing a therapist and doctor regularly to figure this out."
3886,My anxiety is not to the point where I feel that I need to see a therapist or take meds.
3887,I don't have any money for therapy and I am terrified about the time it will take up.
3888,My therapy is on the day before it is all due.
3889,"I'm tired of this anxiety, the therapy isn't working and who is to say that this new therapy is going to work."
3890,"With help from a therapist, she is starting to be able to control her condition and its affect on her life is lessening."
3891,"I've been having GAD and some mild PTSD from an armed robbery in the past, all things i've been beating by meditating and a couple of therapy sessions and i've been anxiety ""free"" for long periods of time since then."
3892,"I know I need to be seeing a therapist, but my anxiety has kept me from going..."
3893,I've looked up some therapists and I hope I'll get the courage to call and make an appointment tomorrow.
3894,"I know therapy is probably something that's going to be suggested a lot, and I do agree that I need it, but I simply can't afford it right now."
3895,"I am taking effexor and see a therapist for my anxiety but I don't feel like it gets better, I still get so overwhelmed I can't breathe and I clench my teeth so hard I have migraines."
3896,All the coping skills I learned in therapy are absolutely useless.
3897,I now take medication (20mg of Prozac) and go to therapy every two weeks.
3898,"In fact, it's a worse feeling BEFORE I got into therapy and medication."
3899,"I've took pills, saw therapists, doctors, psychiatrists, I did researched, I know I have to get sleep, eat well exercise etc but it's still there."
3900,"I finally talked to my parents about it, which helped, and got some therapy from an old wise man I know."
3901,Too broke to attend therapy till fall.
3902,I went to a therapist which lead to be going to psychiatrist.
3903,"All those years of self-diagnosing, of thinking you were just effeminate or weird or awkward, if you just learned enough to be interesting, if you smoked enough that it would just be equivalent to therapy, if you went to the right concerts and took the right psychedelics, and so on and so forth."
3904,I want to leave a link to [Psychology Today's Find a Therapist tool](http://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_search.php).
3905,"If you have insurance, it will also have a list of therapists in your network;."
3906,"Anyway, I had known that I needed therapy for years now."
3907,"I didn't do much except for fill out some paperwork and briefly speak to a therapist about my general problems, but I was glad I finally persevered through with it and made myself go."
3908,It felt like all the effects of going to the therapist today were completely undone.
3909,"I guess it's good that I started therapy today, because now I have a set time to talk about what's bothering me with someone... even though I have to wait three whole weeks to do so."
3910,"I'm happy to have started therapy though, and I hope that within the next few months I will be able to start living life normally!"
3911,"My therapist tells me that I have a hard time focusing on the present, on what's right in front of me."
3912,"I have been on medication such as propanalol but it doesn't help, and been to group therapy which hasn't done anything either."
3913,"I happen to be in grad school, studying to be a therapist."
3914,"As a fledgling therapist, I spend a lot of time talking about how to reduce the stigma of mental illness."
3915,I've had to convince him not to miss his therapist appointments.
3916,"Honestly the best thing for my anxiety is weed and distractions, but I've been considering a therapist."
3917,I had to see therapists.
3918,"(29/Male/USA/United Healthcare/No meds currently)

I'm doing some research on therapists in my area (NW Chicago 'burbs) as I've finally reached the point at which I feel it is necessary to address some matters causing me extreme amounts of distress."
3919,"Bearing in mind that I do plan to see a psychologist/psychiatrist/therapist about this and I'm just trying to gather any input I can:

-I've heard SSRIs are prescribed for GAD."
3920,I was just hoping people could provide some tips/resources on how they selected their therapist?
3921,"Another therapist, who I met with earlier, diagnosed me with general anxiety disorder."
3922,"I can't talk to a therapist, a doctor or anyone."
3923,I need to find a good therapist and I am not even sure how to do it.
3924,"Ive had many anxiety attacks, Ive taken medication and talked to therapists."
3925,"Any success stories on getting on with your life after overcoming anxiety / GAD, therapy and med free?"
3926,"Recently got 'cured' after a lot of therapy but everything that made me feel this way is triggered again, I was trying so hard to be strong and now it's like I'm re-lapsing."
3927,I started going to therapy.
3928,"I didn't like my therapist, but she was at least helping me improve."
3929,I thought about going back to school for music therapy and have been planning for that but if I'm already crazy and crying all the time how am I supposed to just pick up and go to school?
3930,A few weeks ago my ex broke it off with me and I recently sought therapy and I've been put on zoloft 25mg then 50mg next week.
3931,I'm doing therapy because I'm tired of losing out on the best parts of life because of this little monster that lives inside my head.
3932,"I know it takes close to a month for the ssri's to kick in, but will talk therapy and the meds help make me normal?"
3933,I went to see a therapist for an initial assessment at some IAPT scheme a few weeks back.
3934,The therapist who did the initial assessment was suppose to get back to me to talk about other options but they never did.
3935,I am currently seeking another therapist and was just prescribed new medications.
3936,I always tell other people here to try therapy and yet I never do it myself.
3937,"Since starting to see a therapist, I have started to harness the ability to ward off extreme negativity, but old habits die hard and some days are still difficult."
3938,"I started CBT (which I hated, I hated the therapists) and started seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed me Ativan."
3939,I have been to two therapy sessions to differentiate my body and my mind - I have been able to calm myself down through anxiety attacks by focusing on parts of my body and telling myself that this is all my mind creating it.
3940,I started medication and restarted my therapy sessions back in August.
3941,"More specifically, I'm afraid of the hour or so driving I have to do alone to get to work, therapy, and to see my family."
3942,"In trying to find a therapist for my wife, I've found a lot of different treatment styles."
3943,I'm also going to start seeing a therapist because this just isn't something I can live with anymore.
3944,"i can't afford meds or therapy, and i would appreciate any words of wisdom."
3945,"Today I had my first real ""aha"" moment that maybe the citalopram and talk therapy are working so I should keep going with this path of treatment."
3946,"I go to talk therapy every 2 weeks and am on meds, to include Xanax for emergencies."
3947,"The problem with this crush is that I guess it was the first time some girl showed some interest in me as a person (probably platonic-ly), so I guess it felt good and stuff...but I just feel like ashamed that I misread signals, or that I'm not letting go of what I thought were good times that I spent with her (which was just eating a few lunches...which is obviously nothing romantic or whatnot)...

And the fact that it was a real life thing makes it so much different...like now, another thing I'm feeling strangely about is that I don't really orgasm to porn now, because I masturbated to some pictures of my crush (which are not overtly sexual or anything)...I tried to get a ""celebrity crush"" but it's just that they're not real...and I feel ashamed for being attracted to this girl so much...I don't know...fuck...

Like now I've been trying to tell myself the past few days just to get the fuck out of the house, but I have been unable to even do that baby step...it's like I feel so fucked up to even ""bring myself back into society"" or whatnot...

edit: I do have a therapist, but she had off last week...so I guess that might be a contributing factor...but still..."
3948,It's made me feel like I need a hell of a lot more help than just fluxotine and a bunch of other fucking useless pills and NO therapy because the nhs waiting list is disgustingly long.
3949,"So I've recently slipped into this anxiety/depression thing again and my doctor prescribed me some mirtazapine (aka Remeron I think)

I've been on it previously and it has worked magnificiently back then, I took it simultaneously to therapy and during therapy stopped taking it."
3950,"Now I've got this weird anxiety that if I start taking mirtazapine until I can get a free spot in the calendar of some psychotherapist, I won't feel any anxiety anymore and thus won't be able to talk about anything."
3951,"I mean, it's a good thing if the symptoms won't come back as soon as I stop taking the meds, but then I'll probably get stuck in a loop of taking medication until I get to see a therapist and then not being able to talk about anything etc."
3952,"Anyway, the upshot is that i've decided i should get some therapy."
3953,"My dosage for my anti-anxiety pills are 50, when my therapist said most people are fine with just 10 mgs."
3954,"I've tried meditation, yoga, acupuncture, keeping active, positive self-talk, cognitive behavioral therapy, regular therapy, and medication, among things."
3955,"I've gone to therapists before, and has constantly had to move from therapist to therapist because she can't stand any of them."
3956,I enjoy going to therapists because I want to get better.
3957,"We always seem to go to one therapist for a little bit, then switching and never really making any progress."
3958,"I believe I need a therapist and to find ways to alleviate any anxiety I may experience, however, I don't think my parents would allow me to do either."
3959,Part of seeing a therapist has led me to really evaluate the different facets of my anxiety and I think I've found that a majority of my biggest issues would be greatly alleviated by consistently sleeping well.
3960,I'd rather see how therapy helps.
3961,"I'm going to address this question with my therapist next week but for the time being I'd like to ask you because I am desperate for good sleep:

**Tl;dr: Have you taken medication to aid in sleep?"
3962,I've been in therapy (group + individual) for an eating disorder (now recovered).
3963,The fact is I am capable of managing my OCD with the help of my therapist whom I clearly need to start seeing again.
3964,"Is there anyone out there with severe anxiety that got onto meds, then dealt with their issues in therapy and were able to return to a normal lifestyle?"
3965,"ie, no meds, no therapy."
3966,"I spent 5 years thinking I had refractory OCD and trying therapy and treatment that wouldn't work, 'cause the doctors couldn't treat me."
3967,"So, I've been seeing a therapist, and that's helped a little, but she's terribly against SSRI's."
3968,"The plan now is to fill it and then get to work with exercising every day, continuing my therapy, eating better, kicking caffeine and alcohol for the next few months and see how that goes."
3969,"ive been to therapists and they didnt do much, im gonna try going to another therapist soon though cuz im still looking for help."
3970,I'm currently seeing a therapist but I can't afford to see him as often as I would like and I find that in between visits i'm at my worst.
3971,I currently live in a foreign country where I cannot consult a therapist because of cost reasons and since I am going to be back home in less than 2 months.
3972,"Examples:

- I worry an awful lot that my psychologist will forget to refer me to a therapist."
3973,I saw the psychologist on Friday last week and she said she'd email or call me when she's referred me or when she's referred me and the therapist has confirmed he's gotten the referral (don't remember which one).
3974,I've tried therapy once before (in May) and that didn't go well because of the therapist and last time they sort of lost my referral so I had to wait much longer than expected before getting to see a therapist.
3975,"Beginning a journey of self help, need to get to a point where I'm brave enough to call a therapist."
3976,I definitely need some professional help (I need actual divine intervention but I'm trying to be realistic here) but am wondering if I can supplement therapy with these books and if they will actually DO something.
3977,"just thought i'd share some of my experiences with therapy, for those of you who are still hesitant to get help."
3978,"I did not really want anything to do with therapy, as i really didn't know much about it and thought all of my problems could be solved by drugs alone."
3979,"I wanted CBT because i wanted more ways to cope with what was going on, rather than the 'touchy-feely' stuff i had painted therapy to be."
3980,Is there anything I can do on my own to help fix this other than just self-induced exposure therapy (i.e.
3981,I have made an appointment with a therapist and I would like to tell me husband but have not been able to bring myself to do it.
3982,"I've been seeing a therapist about it for about 6 months, which has helped, but all that stuff goes out the window when I get into full-anxiety mode, of course."
3983,Don't know where it all came from and I kept apologizing because the poor doctor isn't a therapist.
3984,"As my therapist would say, we need to take ownership of the positives as well as the negatives."
3985,My therapist asks if I would really want to conform to being normal but bored (since we've established I'm a bit different from the norm.
3986,"I've done all of the ""normal"" stuff... medication, therapy, etc and while it's definitely helped, I'd still constantly have anxiety and panic attacks, although not as severe."
3987,so since 4th grade ive been seeing therapist on and off for my daddy issues that evolved into family disfunction.
3988,do therapy!
3989,"I know I would like to see a therapist, but should I get any sort of medication?"
3990,"I don't take any medication whatsoever for anything and I've never seen a therapist, but I'm heavily considering it."
3991,Does exposure therapy really work for things like this?
3992,"My therapist gave me a great way to handle anxiety attacks, but it definitely takes a little practice before it's completely effective, as you really have to concentrate."
3993,"Boy in a Bubble: http://youtu.be/DagAUoObZjc

And just a brief description of what I go through/went through:
-In and out of therapy
-Runs in the family (brother/mother/father)
-Have tried meditation, acupuncture, hypnotherapy
-Weed has induced panic attacks as well, and after 2 very bad ones, 2 months ago I stopped for good
-Multiple panic attacks daily which caused me to leave school, these were eventually controlled by 10mg of Lexapro for about 3 years."
3994,"At the moment I am in intense therapy/hypnotherapy and after paxil made things worse, I am now just starting 20mg of lexapro."
3995,"I have also tried therapy, as well as different approaches to conquere my anxiety: Like, Meditation, Breathing excercises, Healthy Eating, and lots of working out and running, none of which has worked."
3996,I want  to be able to talk to a counselor or a therapist and try to get help but I still live at home and I can't afford it and even though my mothers job covers it i'm afraid to ask her.
3997,"I've got a long history of depression and anxiety issues (15+ years) which I've used a couple different methods, but I reached a point a few years back where I didn't have insurance and the cost to treat with prescriptions or talk therapy was just too expensive and I wasn't poor enough to qualify for income based programs."
3998,"It's inhibiting my life so much and I just want it to stop, but I'm also afraid of going to my mom and saying, ""I think I have an anxiety disorder, can I go to a therapist?"""
3999,My therapist suggested these two pills to help with my anxiety and depression.
4000,And I have an appointment in about two months with a therapist somehow.
4001,I thought it was a reaction to all of the positive steps I had been taking in my exposure therapy.
4002,"It's really taken all of my courage today to just call my therapist, doctor, and now post on here."
4003,"Until then, I'll just be sitting here, counting down from a thousand, waiting to hear back from my doctor and/or therapist... and the phone ringing will, no doubt, make me panic."
4004,I felt uncomfortable with the idea of therapy for my anxiety for a long time.
4005,"So, I finally got into therapy after putting it off for several months."
4006,"We agreed to try therapy alone first, and that if it wasn't helping she would refer me to someone to talk about medication."
4007,"I saw a therapist once a week for about 4 months, and she feels like I'm doing well enough to stop for now."
4008,"But, seeing a therapist really helped give me better tools to deal with it as it comes."
4009,"It's much more comedy focused, but the host Pete Holmes often talks about his experiences with therapy, and sometimes the guests do as well."
4010,"I've taken meds, I've had therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and who knows what else."
4011,Why wasn't I recommended talk therapy first or just prescribed a low dose benzo?
4012,Try talk therapy.
4013,I am currently looking for a therapist in the area.
4014,I haven't seen a therapist in almost 5 years.
4015,"It's been about a year since I left school, I go to therapy twice a week, I see a psychatrist, and I'm slowly learning how to eat properly, and stand up for myself around people."
4016,Once I get back i'm due to start my new job but it's 3 years of training of which I won't have time to get therapy or anything like that.
4017,Secondly have any of you come across some good online resources for cognitive behavior therapy as I'd like to give it a go but doubt i'll get to actually see a therapist.
4018,I have been to therapists who didn't help and ironically enough I've been too anxious to tell them it's not working and just sorta disappeared.
4019,"I talked to her a bit and she suggested therapy, specifically one that specializes in PTSD and social anxiety."
4020,"We both know the first step should be telling my mom, we've been very close since I was born and she's also a therapist."
4021,I'd find it weird talking to my mom in depth about how I feel as both a mother/therapist.
4022,"I've been dealing with some serious baggage for awhile now, seeing therapists and trying to work through it with some friends; most of which have either discarded me, or made it obvious I should let them go until I can figure all of this out."
4023,"I've always been pretty highly suicidal with too low initiative to bother doing anything about it, which is something I've kept from my therapist because I find it difficult to trust anyone I consider 'adult' because of my mother's unintended but very real hover parent nature

I'm generally not happy with myself, my family and the world but I also realize there isn't much I'm entitled to complain about having never bothered to make much of a difference myself."
4024,"At first he was willing to do couples therapy, then he changed his mind, and then he changed it again."
4025,If for any reason I have tight neck or shoulder muscles and I notice it then I seem to see it as the onset of anxiety and it kind of snowballs from there... My therapist has shown my something called Progressive Muscle Relaxation.
4026,I've been in and out of therapy since a very young age.
4027,"I've been in weekly therapy for over a year now, and I've been entirely commited to my recovery."
4028,What about therapy?
4029,Just allowing myself to say this feels already better and has a far more calming effect than any therapy I ever went to.
4030,I know doctors and therapists are there to help us but they do have to understand that one formula does not work for everybody.
4031,It took about a year and a half of therapy to understand that I was dealing with depression and anxiety (don't know if it was because I am a difficult/unique case or because the numerous professionals I met with were incompetent).
4032,I've stopped going to therapy after missing one appointment.
4033,I'm stressed about work tomorrow and I have my first appointment with therapy that I have to miss work for.
4034,So I was absolutely blindsided this morning when I showed up for my appointment and my therapist was not there.
4035,"I have written letters, tried to get them to attend therapy with me, and tried to deal with it."
4036,"I've tried therapy (CBT - really didn't work for me, considering ACT/mindfulness) medication (on lamictal which usually for bipolar, and has helped the depression but not the anxiety), meditation, exercise, diet, reframing etc etc."
4037,"- I go to individual therapy, group therapy, and a meditation class regularly."
4038,"I've been going to therapy, but I have been dealing with other forms of anxiety."
4039,"I'll try working on it in therapy as best I can, but I would like some opinions."
4040,and the experiences I had with different therapies and meds.
4041,"I am currently in the middle of a CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy) group treatment, have a PRN, and a good support network."
4042,I have just completed a short 6 session CBT course and I am trying to arrange further therapy.
4043,"Now, I've gone to therapy a bunch of times with different people and it helped tremendously."
4044,"Recently I've just been suggesting coping strategies... learn breathing strategies, eat well, consider some kind of exposure therapy, talk to someone."
4045,I'm thinking about trying out exposure therapy for my fear of vomiting/vomiting in public; does anyone have any experiences with this?
4046,Or just exposure therapy in general?
4047,I understand what exposure therapy is but I don't personally know anyone who has gone through it and I'm interested in hearing some first-hand accounts.
4048,I'm not on meds or in therapy but I do have valium.
4049,I'm on meds and in therapy and everything but none of it seems to be working.
4050,"I decided I should at least have a few sessions with a therapist to see where things go, however, I'm sans health insurance."
4051,"The title pretty much says it all, but I am a little nervous about getting emotional and breaking down crying when I try to explain to the therapist what I'm going through and why I want to see her."
4052,"It took me 4 months after my doctor diagnosed me to actually open up and tell my boyfriend and some close friends about it, about 2 weeks after that to gather up the courage to call a therapist, and a month and a half to finally find one on my plan and go to an appointment."
4053,I went to a therapist and after waiting a month and a half for the assessment they blamed everything on the fact that I'm a teenager and sent me off to another place with a huge waiting list.
4054,"Over a year of therapy, both individual and group, psychiatrist, medications, a week in the mental ward, and I'm still not going anywhere."
4055,"My doctor agreed with my choice and both my doctor and therapist agreed that maybe meds were not the treatment for me, as my anxiety and depression are highly situational and at a second glance, aren't the type of thing you want to treat with medication first."
4056,"I want to get therapy, but what kind do I need?"
4057,I can't pay for therapy right now so I want some type of medication to help lift it a bit.
4058,I avoid medication and stick to herbal tea and self-therapy.
4059,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
4060,Been going to therapy once a week for about a year a half for mild depression and generalized anxiety and it's actually getting better.
4061,Exposure therapy like that is the only thing that I've found to work with things like this.
4062,"Should I start seeing a therapist, a psychologist or psychiatrist?"
4063,"No matter what I do, no motivation, no strategy, medicine, therapy can do to stop the other me's."
4064,"So I feel like it's safe to assume that I have some mild to moderate form of anxiety, although I've never seen a doctor or therapist about it (yes, dangerous to self-diagnose)."
4065,"I would be absolutely terrified of making the effort of seeing a therapist, telling them I think I have anxiety, and in the end they tell me the humiliating fact that I really don't have anxiety."
4066,I have been struggling with nearly crippling anxiety for several years now but just got into therapy because of financial constraints.
4067,Tomorrow is my first therapy session and I am trying to complete no shave november..
4068,Not even to my partner or therapist.
4069,"I do go to therapy, but I can’t even verbalize these things there."
4070,Who knows if that involves the help of pills or therapy or a healthy diet or what.
4071,"I've been diagnosed with anxiety at a young age and was on lexapro for a year, didnt like it much, and my doctor and I decided to do traditional talk therapy and things were going well."
4072,"I emailed my doctor and she said we can talk about medication changes, and I'm going to up my trips to the talk therapy."
4073,Perhaps I should just keep my worries between me and the therapist.
4074,"Therapy (I have an amazing therapist) and meds (Zoloft, 25 mg starting dose and now 50mg) have brought me from point A to point B:

Point A: Crying for sometimes 6+ hours, couldn't eat, cried in the bathroom at work, stopped working altogether, relationship with fiance severely strained, losing weight, sleeping for 2 - 4 hours per night, constant fog and depersonalization, intense depression and hopelessness, feelings of dread/phobia regarding work, constantly triggered by almost everything


Point B: Able to attend social events, returned to work and ended the year on a great note (I am a teacher), went to the bar with colleagues, excited to plan my wedding and day trips with fiance/friends, eating full meals and no anxiety about food, sleeping 8+ hours nightly, hope for the future, desire to help others and excitement for my upcoming school year, very few triggers and able to calm down when I am triggered."
4075,This all changed in a matter of weeks due to therapy and meds.
4076,"Seek therapy, possibly meds, don't let yourself needlessly suffer."
4077,note: I called my therapist that I saw for 10 months about three years ago today and got her voicemail.
4078,He told me about Alpha-Stim [link1](http://www.alpha-stim.com/as100/)which is a type of CES [link2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_electrotherapy_stimulation).
4079,"Heres my story: 20 years old male, had social anxiety all my life, I was very shy and socially awkward person,but 6 months ago I sucessfully overcame it by doing exposure therapy (forcing myself to walk up to random strangers and make a little conversations, even if it is just asking what time it is?)"
4080,Also what do you think about going back to good old exposure therapy?
4081,I'm having this conversation with my therapist -- why does every minute thing seem like a BIG DEAL to us anxious people?
4082,I guess I'm partly worried about the cost of therapy and such programs and finding a way around it because we've never been very financially secure.
4083,"Even my therapist tells me she can ""guarantee I'm so good I'll always be able to find a job."""
4084,"I've had two therapists over the years, one my mom made me go to when I was younger, and another while I was at college provided by my school."
4085,Do i need to see a therapist or something?.
4086,"I've gone to a therapist once, but just got frustrated over her questioning for no apparent reason."
4087,"I wish I could go to therapy, but I do not have enough funds to do so."
4088,"Whenever I tell my mom I get anxious, she'll usually just say I'm fine, so I question whether or not I'm just exaggerating and the therapist will see nothing wrong with me."
4089,"This weekend, I saw a therapist."
4090,She refuses to discuss visiting a therapist.
4091,I've suggested my friend take his parents to a therapist to get their advise.
4092,Or forcing her to correspond with a therapist online.
4093,Or maybe the therapist needs to visit their house.
4094,"I know the best course of action would be to encourage her to go see a therapist and/or get medications, but due to her experiences with them far in the past (before I knew her) there is no way I can get her to do so."
4095,"I had been in therapy for 5 years prior to all this, so I am pretty self aware, but still have a lot to learn."
4096,Ideally I wish I could just see one person who would perform talk therapy and also diagnose drugs if I needed them.
4097,"If anyone else out there has depression that is similar to my own, (workaholism / self-improvement-aholism) I would be curious to know what kind of talk therapy has helped you?"
4098,**TL;DR:** Been in therapy for five years.
4099,My therapist says I need to do something nice for myself like go on a small vacation or buy something for myself but I honestly can't think of anything.
4100,"I finally got my act together and applied for a service that provides primary care, therapy and dentistry services for uninsured low-income individuals."
4101,"I am doing therapy at the moment, but I can only get an appointment once a month, so I'd like to get some advice that I can work on inbetween sessions."
4102,The most common seems to be combined therapy and medication.
4103,I went to therapy when I was 11 and it worked.
4104,I'll have to do it once more just to go through these 2 weeks before my therapist comes back from holidays.
4105,I would have done it already but I'll have to see my mom in two days and it would be hard to explain her that my therapy can't help me right away.
4106,"I'm likely moving back home for next semester and when I'm back I plan to find a therapist, but in the meantime how I can I make the next month more pleasant?"
4107,I have been struggling with anxiety for a while now (I may do therapy) but I was wondering does anyone suffer physically from anxiety?
4108,I told my doc that I will probably see a therapist.
4109,I will make an appointment with my therapist tomorrow.
4110,I've talked to a friend who is also a therapist and realized the three times are all linked over the last 10 years to a single event that happened to me in college.
4111,"I moved away from my home and support structure in the last few years and I am not comfortable bearing all to my therapist friend, even though they have been really helpful."
4112,I've tried to find a therapist in my current city but nothing fits my schedule.
4113,"I've contacted my old therapist, who was amazing, to see if they do skype/phone sessions as a backup."
4114,It's affecting my life enough that I'm starting therapy and trying to do everything I can to give me a leg-up.
4115,When I started my therapy they gave me some helpful information on different drugs that can be used to treat depression and anxiety.
4116,"I'm seeing a therapist right now for some of it, but it doesn't seem to help and they're the only one that I can go to for free."
4117,i'm starting bi-weekly therapy sessions with a therapist in the near future.. i imagine this will be the most helpful....
4118,"Fortunately I've managed to open to at least one therapist, which is great."
4119,"In time (with the help of the therapist) I will get over all these problems, which really all stem from one deep issue."
4120,Will the counselor/therapist understand?
4121,I've tried therapy and the whole experience made me worse about myself.
4122,Getting close to my next therapy session and I just cannot do it.
4123,"I explained this to my cognitive behavioral therapist who said she was somewhat concerned, but will monitor it for now."
4124,"When I was diagnosed, the doctor recommended i see a therapist but my parents won't let me"
4125,"I've been seeing a weekly therapist who I feel is helping me, and I plan to continue seeing her for as long as I need to."
4126,I've tried therapy but the only thing around here is CBT and it just doesn't work.
4127,I've tried therapy but the only thing around here is CBT and it just doesn't work.
4128,I want to seek out a therapist.
4129,I'm really fucking scared... and I don't know what to do...I talked to my wife shes going to schedule me to see my doctor and get a referral to a psychiatrist to get therapy.
4130,After several therapists and several medications things got a little better.
4131,I started seeing a therapist about 7 months ago.
4132,I asked her what it was for and she said it was a reference in case I'd ever need therapy some day.
4133,"My therapist told me to just chew carefully and eat softer foods, but I'm so scared to eat."
4134,"I'm also going back to school in a few weeks, and I want to start some treatment (medication, therapy, or something) before I go back."
4135,My SO also suffers from anxiety and right now I’m looking into ways to help both of us deal with it until we can talk to someone [ie: a therapist] about ways to cope.
4136,A therapist?
4137,I have been doing a workbook that focuses on this therapy and have been seeing a therapist bi weekly to help with it.
4138,"I've tried since about 12 to get to see a therapist and after I did see one and they found out how insane my mom was and the dr. confronted her, my mom canceled all appointments with her and tried to sue her for some bullshit."
4139,"So, I went to a psychologist and a therapist."
4140,I just want to know what can I do besides therapy that I have to go to.
4141,"I have been suffering from very bad health anxiety ever since  my father died last year and have been to therapy which didn't help an awful lot, but I have decided to engage in the process again possibly in combination with a medication."
4142,I tried to search for an online therapy service as I feel very uncomfortable talking face-to-face.
4143,"http://www.samaritans.org.sg/contact/emailb.asp

Are there any international online therapy websites I can check out?"
4144,"Also, is online therapy effective as compared to seeing a ""real life"" therapist?"
4145,"I feel like I'll never get better (can barely afford seeing a doctor and buying meds, can't afford to see a therapist at the moment)."
4146,I am going to see my therapist today.
4147,"So, a little backstory - i`ve been battling severe depression and anxiety (or so my therapists said i have) for the last 16 years, got diagnosed officially when i was 23 after a severe mental breakdown and started seeking professional help because i just couldn`t keep going like this anymore and started very seriously contemplating suicide."
4148,"Spend the following two years on and off in psychotherapy sessions as well as taking SSRIs (the one i was taking you may know as Luvox, here in Belarus it`s sells under a Fevarin brand name)."
4149,"Now; my parents have taken me to therapy (once), and I have been prescribed pills (which were never filled as of almost six months ago but still, they seem to think there's nothing wrong."
4150,"yeah so the past week or so i've been feeling great but i've had intermittant periods of feeling awful, how do i go about telling my new therapist my symptoms and how resistant should i be to medication?"
4151,"Medication wasn't working, neither was therapy."
4152,"This is in conjunction with CBT/talk therapy, meditation, exercise, and diet changes to assist."
4153,"I've considered hypnotherapy and further meditation, but my last therapist was kind of useless for me so I'd have to find a new one if I went that route."
4154,"I scheduled an appointment with a therapist/counselor, so hopefully I can get some help with my anxiety soon."
4155,I have told them I want to go to therapy but they never understood why.
4156,"I haven't really told my friends because I don't feel that they would understand the ritual thing, and honestly I'm not ready to go into detail with anyone but a therapist about it."
4157,"I've been seeing my therapist for 2 years, and I like her a lot, and have made a lot of progress."
4158,"I've always had therapy end for other reasons, and I can't afford to see anyone else right now."
4159,"I expect therapists to be human, but this is too much."
4160,I'm not sure how to go about this with my therapist.
4161,"I might be going to do the program with them, which is a therapy-group from 17- 24 years old when we are going to do some individual therapy,, group therapy and sports."
4162,"I would like to stop using Xanax during these episodes and not see a psychotherapist, so I came to you people in this subreddit for help."
4163,I am very very very glad I found this subreddit because it has been critical in treating my generalized anxiety disorder (which is just going to be a short term thing in my life) in conjunction with seeing my doctor and therapist.
4164,"I see a therapist, take meds, and exercise, but I'm finding it difficult to resolve these negativities, or at least make progress up the hill which at times feels like Mt."
4165,It is has been firmly dissociated from my diet by my therapist.
4166,"I saw a therapist and attended group therapy, and learn coping skills to prevent panic attacks."
4167,I don't want to go back to therapy.
4168,"Anyways, I was going to a doctor and was on a waiting list for a therapist, I’ve been through plenty of meds for depression and anxiety, my last prescription I’ve taken was a generic clonazepam, or k-pin."
4169,"I don’t take them anymore because I had moved and I don’t have health insurance for a doctor, I never got a therapist."
4170,"I am definitely open-minded to other sorts of therapy, but it scares the shit out of me think that in the short term I could have a panic attack and not have my ""panic abort"" mechanism (xanax) available."
4171,"I am reading the sidebar: 
&gt;If your anxiety is interfering with how you want to live your everyday life, if it is preventing you from doing things you want to do, or if you now run your life around your anxiety, you should get an evaluation and consider therapy."
4172,I went to a respected therapist many times and he says he sees no signs of anything serious.
4173,"All my life I thought I had depression, but my therapist actually explained to me that I have depression caused by anxiety."
4174,I'm also interested to hear how your therapists/psychiatrists have addressed your ED with your anxiety.
4175,"I haven't been in therapy for almost 15 years, and I'm terrified to go back (I had a bad experience with one in my teens, and it's just compounded in my mind that they're all going to be like that), but I know that I'm at the point with my anxiety/depression/ED that I need professional help other than medication."
4176,I don't want to see a therapist because i know all they are going to do is recommend some sort of medication and i'd rather not become addicted to pills.
4177,"I saw a therapist for my anxiety briefly last year, and she told me that this is relatively common in anxiety sufferers."
4178,"I wasn't able to continue seeing that therapist, so unfortunately I didn't really get to learn any coping strategies for this."
4179,I learned this technique through therapy.
4180,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_breathing


*edit:  I learned this techinique, including the charting process, through an 8-week (though it turned into 20+weeks) program based on cognitive-behavioral therapy to treat Generalized Anxiety Disorder (manifested it self in Lupus like symptoms)."
4181,The is the book that formed the basis of the therapy: http://www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/0195300017/?view=usa  I highly recommend this book AND cognitive-behavioral therapy if you think you might have GAD.
4182,"- I wake up 2-3 times a night with my heart racing
- I'm drowsy when I wake up so I feel trapped in my body because I have adrenaline, but no energy
- When I do sleep, my dreams are extremely vivid and either scary, or very action-oriented

Things I have tried

- I go to therapy
- I take lavender/chamomile baths before bed
- I take 3mg melatonin before sleep
- Go to the gym in the evening to make myself more tired
- Drink sleepy-time tea
- Put lavender drops on my pillow
- Listen to rain noises to go to sleep
- Sometimes I'll smoke some pot to get me to relax enough to fall asleep


I'm so exhausted from 2 weeks without sleep, plus the exhaustion from panic attacks that completely take over your body, that falling asleep is no problem, the real issue is staying asleep/getting a restful sleep."
4183,"The teachers there are really nice, they have a therapist that talks to everyone once in a while."
4184,I haven't been diagnosed with PTSD but have been seeing a CBT therapist which I unfortunately can't keep seeing because I graduated college.
4185,I have a therapy session today and am ashamed of my mistake of drinking and I'm exhausted from the panic attack.
4186,Should I go to therapy today?
4187,I'm worried that my therapist will be disappointed.
4188,"However, My CBT therapist recommended that I'll continue with ""regular"" psychotherapy - You know, the kind in which you talk about how your parents accidentally ruined your life and such."
4189,"I've been seeing my new psychotherapist for a month and a half now, And while it is quite comforting to talk about my life and past, I can't see any improvement - maybe because it's not supposed to appear so early."
4190,"tl;dr: Did any of you try conventional psychotherapy to deal with anxiety disorders, specifically General Anxiety?"
4191,"Just got diagnosed with strong SAD, mild OCD, and mild depression last week (mostly due to my SAD)

Currently I am on 20mg Prozac daily and I think I will be on this SSRI for a while... not feeling too much yet...
am also going through exposure therapy sessions with my psychiatrist

I was wondering if it is a bad idea to be messing around with drugs while on my treatment?"
4192,"It's also worth noting that I guess you could say I'm in between therapists right now; the last one and I disagreed on some pretty fundamental things, but I'm working on getting a new one."
4193,"I've been trying to take it one step at a time and get better, go to therapy, take my meds, try to breath."
4194,"It doesn't help that my new therapist isn't working out, so now I feel more useless, worthless, and like I can't get better."
4195,I've tried therapy in the past and it really didn't work.
4196,"Before anyone asks, Yes I'm on medicine (Celexa), yes I'm going to see a therapist."
4197,I'm seeing a therapist and we're just barely getting to this after spending some time on some other issues.
4198,I just got back from the therapist and as it made me feel better it also made me think.
4199,My therapist reccommened outpatient treatment.
4200,"I've done a ton of therapy, at least four years of weekly visits and I am just drained."
4201,"Now I have a choice of psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, counsellors, etc and I'm a little lost."
4202,"So, knowing what you know now, given the choice of psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, counsellors, where would you begin?"
4203,"Also, i'm going to the psychologist and, at the therapy, i feel way better (other personal matters that make me anxious)

TL;DR: Was healthy, after a ""traumatic"" incidente got very anxious about my own health and started to have (maybe) self inducted headaches."
4204,"on meds, off meds, in therapy, out of therapy."
4205,"I've done it all to stop being so anxious-- medication, mindful meditation, therapy (found an amazing therapist through the International OCD Foundation that knows what he's talking about!"
4206,So should I keep trying to look for a therapist?
4207,Thanks to my therapist and to this training it is getting better.
4208,I'm also going to my therapist's tonight and will inform him about all of this.
4209,So now I get to see a physician about the sweat and a therapist about the anxiety.
4210,"From what I know, I'd have to disclose that I see a therapist and the investigators would speak with them about my diagnosis."
4211,"I've tried 3 psychiatrists, 4 therapists, about 10 different drug regimens, diet, exercise, meditation, nothing's worked."
4212,But my therapist who is practising narrative psychology does not agree with the principles of this book.
4213,"I've got therapy for panic attacks before but it never helped perfectly, I still get panic attacks outside because I fear I'll be thrown into the sky."
4214,"Finally started treatment, including therapy, about 8 months ago."
4215,I also get a ton of cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) every week and I'm gonna start jogging (couch to 5k).
4216,I've asked several doctors and therapists about it but they never gave me a clear-cut answer.
4217,My main concern is that  he's going to write me off as okay and put me into therapy.
4218,"I've been in therapy before and it never helped me , and I've been waiting a month for this appointment."
4219,"I'm going to do what my doctor suggested and take my SSRI in the morning (which for some reason, right when they switched to a different generic, seemed to just STOP WORKING - so I'm going to try to switch pharmacies and get a different manufacturer), exercise 4x per week (which of course terrifies me because I have palpitations which feel terrible and my endo isn't convinced that my thyroid dosage is too high since my thyroid numbers are 'fine'), and start CBT (in talks with a therapist, nothing scheduled yet)."
4220,or some other free or near-free alternative to professional therapy?
4221,I've started up therapy again a few months ago for unrelated issues...but now this has become the big problem.
4222,I've spent the past two sessions crying to my therapist about how I'm so tired of being exhausted and in pain all the time...but I know full well that what I'm doing is not helping.
4223,(It also doesn't help things that my therapist just came back after being on leave to deal with a cancer diagnosis.)
4224,"She and her doctor both recommended that I go see a psychotherapist, but when I heard of the price and the wait of 9 months."
4225,"(I want to emphasize that you do not need a psychologist, or psychotherapist to come to this understanding."
4226,I recently went to a therapist and he told me I have social anxiety disorder and maybe a certain form of agoraphobia.
4227,":/

I haven't had therapy or taken any medications."
4228,Amy has been on multiple medications and seen many different therapists over her life.
4229,"I really don't want to lose my job (again), and although hypnotherapy seems to help for a while, it seems to 'run out' after a couple of months."
4230,"Although at 13 my therapist pretty much said, ""Social Anxiety!"""
4231,The hardest part is remaining in therapy and thinking positively.
4232,I have never received any therapy or treatment for this disorder.
4233,Know of any good therapist around the area?
4234,"I drove back to work to sign next year's contract and get some things stored away for summer floor cleaning...but with my therapist's help, I intend to go back stronger, more adamant, not afraid of things like phone calls home, stopping misbehavior in the process, etc."
4235,"Are there any ways to fix this issue or any suggestions (and I already have therapy as an option, I know)."
4236,"I'm currently getting therapy and TRYING to find a psychiatrist (HMO insurance sucks), so that is something i'm doing in the mean time."
4237,Anyways so fast forward a couple months and I eventually get an appointment with my doctor who gives me an option (and this is something I'm very thankful for) to either try therapy and then depending on how that goes add a drug regime to try and get it under control or start therapy and an added drug regime at the same time.
4238,There is by no means anything wrong with taking medication for anxiety (I eventually went that route after about 2 years) I just felt at the time that the best course of action for myself personally was therapy on it's own to see how that had an effect on getting my anxiety under control.
4239,I can tell you that going to a therapist isn't as bad as it seems.
4240,"I actually cannot speak highly enough of how helpful therapy turns out to be so if anyone reading this takes anything form this post please let it be that therapy is definetly worth checking out, it very well may have saved my life and I cannot recommend it enough if you ever find yourself at 'that' point where you don't think you can deal with it."
4241,Is he going to refer me to a therapist?
4242,"Alternatively, they will try and draw blood, which is my biggest trigger and a severe phobia that years of therapy has yet to resolve."
4243,"Despite weekly therapy sessions, I was more or less unable to attend class."
4244,"- **Cognitive behavioural therapy**

- **The right medication**

- **Support from those close to me**

I cannot stress enough the importance of these."
4245,"I've tried everything.. pills (like xanax and lexapro), therapy, getting high to help me get away from everything, doing yoga, and i've even been institutionalized once because my panic attacks are so violent and frequent, my mother has no idea how to deal with them anymore."
4246,"All diagnosed (most of them anyways) by my ""mostly"" quite lovely GP, who does try to help with my issues but keeps insisting she can't help me with my ""underlying issues"" and that I need to go speak to a therapist so he/she can diagnose me more properly."
4247,"I did therapy, took medication, learned meditation (ADHD, so no real results there), and started the gym (3 years in, still attending)."
4248,"However, I am a big believer in the power of exposure therapy, so I tend to stick to posting in some ""safe"" subreddits in the hope that dealing with the odd scuffle will make me more resilient."
4249,"That idea bothers me so much, because I have been working so hard in therapy and in my own life to....*not* take a victim stance, or be a crybaby about things."
4250,"Using the link on the right that says ""finding a therapist"" I picked someone that was close by and accepted my insurance."
4251,"If you have insurance, check that out first before contacting a therapist."
4252,"You don't have to be a total mess before you go (I actually worried that I wasn't anxious enough to warrant a therapist) you don't have to go on meds (if you don't want to), and you don't even have to commit to more than one session."
4253,"I stayed there for two weeks, and have been medicated and seeing a psychiatrist/therapist since."
4254,I've tried therapy.
4255,I suck at therapy...
4256,"I always tell the therapist what I think they want to hear, as if to get out of there as quickly as possible."
4257,"Unfortunately I'm not currently seeing a therapist, so I was hoping for some input until I can get back to one."
4258,Last week I broke down and told my therapist that I didn't think cognitive therapy was working.
4259,"The most common outcome that I have read, on here and multiple other forums is, ""My panic attacks still occur, but therapy helped me better deal with them."
4260,"The doctor mentioned cognitive behavioural therapy, medication, exercise, etc."
4261,"but she has suffered depression in the past but is very, very against medication and the thought of therapy quite literally scares her."
4262,I do believe she may some very personal things bottled up very tight and think that some kind of therapy may help.
4263,"I am not on any kind of medication for my anxiety, I have been before but then I moved to another country and have yet to go see a new therapist/doctor."
4264,The school therapist recommended that I start fresh with some new more modern doctors.
4265,"I've tried grief counseling, I'm currently going through emotional yoga therapy (out of the box, I know), and I'm prescribed clonazepam for road trips where my husband drives and I try to pretend I'm not on a bridge."
4266,I've finally realized that I should see a therapist and see if there is any medication I should be taking.
4267,Has therapy helped for you?
4268,I tried to make and appointment with her to get some more and to start the therapy she thinks will help me a lot but they told me she was on vacation until February.
4269,They don't believe in getting therapy or medication to fix anxiety.
4270,"If I want something like psychotherapy, should I be looking for a psychiatrist?"
4271,BUT getting into therapy takes months.
4272,But I rarely hear people talk about how therapy has changed their lives.
4273,Can I get some raving reviews about how seeing a therapist has solved people's anxiety?
4274,"A friend of mine on the bus said it was a panic attack, I haven't had a panic attack in months and I have been having major breakthroughs with therapy so I don't think it was a panic attack."
4275,"Luckily I had an appointment with my therapist an hour later, so I talked it over with her."
4276,"At home, I had been seeing the same therapist for five or six years."
4277,&gt;I really think as soon as this contract is done (but maybe not until after Arizona work; and hopefully having my girlfriend around will keep me more level being able to talk to her; you are the most empathetic person I've ever met) I need to talk to a therapist or someone.
4278,"I am a man, so of course, I don't want to go to a therapist."
4279,I finally decided I might need some therapy so I have an appointment with a cognitive therapist next week.
4280,"So yeh, definate reason to go to a therapist since I can't get out of this on my own."
4281,It's already happening in just thinking about talking and about what my therapist might ask.
4282,"Some background story, Firstly, I am 22 have either major depressive disorder or I am bipolar (my physician and therapist is trying to determine which)."
4283,"I did a ton of things for us including seeing my doctor, getting my medication increased/adjusted, and scheduled to start seeing a therapist."
4284,"I was a mess for a while as expected, and ironically enough, my first therapist session was scheduled the day after she broke up with me."
4285,"I could've graduated had I gotten my shit totally together, but my therapist went on leave recently and I haven't been able to find another one who I feel comfortable with."
4286,I need to find a therapist that does CBT or something like that.
4287,"I know I need help, but therapy is too expensive."
4288,"I've been seeing my current therapist for a while, and for the most part she's been helping me, but recently she seems to not really be listening to me, and instead telling me what my problems are."
4289,"I've had big issues with this in the past, my last therapist told my parents that my friends were the cause of many of my issues, and that if I were to live alone I'd do much better with dealing with things."
4290,"And now that my current therapist is also, for lack of a better term, gaslighting me, I'm really starting to lose hope."
4291,"So far, countless medications, therapy and psychiatry haven't been able to fix me."
4292,"I've been seeing ads online, more and more every day for online therapy companies."
4293,"Despite my best efforts to keep improving, seeking out therapy, and adopting better life habits, I've come to realize that this is who we are."
4294,I told my therapist what medications I was on (Effexor and Lamictal) and she asked what I was put on those for.
4295,My therapist said I/the doctor should be focusing on treating my anxiety/depression.
4296,"I never knew why I had such trouble getting on with my life, but upon getting a therapist she started to imply that a lifetime of parents that were either addicted to drugs most of the time or just flat out weren't there for me were the cause of my anxiety disorders."
4297,"I've been too prideful to ask for any help like ""How could they possibly tell me something I don't already know"", but I did mention to my dad before that I'd be interested in therapy."
4298,"I don't want to be taken to a therapist or anything like that, I don't want to be medicated again definitely."
4299,"So I went to a therapist and a ""special"" school where I could learn to go to school again."
4300,I met with my new therapist today.
4301,"It's still going to be hard for me to afford therapy, I don't think this therapist is my insurance network either."
4302,She suggested that I get a workbook to help me learn and practice skills between the times that I can afford therapy sessions.
4303,"Anyway, I'm already talking to a therapist about this stuff."
4304,"My therapist mentioned that I should get a creative outlet, and recommended writing."
4305,"That's why I'm scared to tell my mother, how do you say ""I'm depressed with high anxiety and I need help, I need a therapist""."
4306,I posted this in r/Buddhism because it's related to an idea that fits with Buddhism but it is really also a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy application.
4307,"I read the entire book ""Buddhism on the Couch,"" which involved just this subject of the combination of Buddhism and psychotherapy."
4308,"Her psychiatrist is not accepting new patients, but they have a therapist in the same building that is."
4309,"This guy is an LPC, but listed under psychotherapists in the yellow pages and whatnot."
4310,"I saw a therapist, I began a social anxiety program I found on Reddit, and I vowed myself to life the coming spring semester with balance, care, and gentleness for my mental and physical health."
4311,"I balanced my workload, ate wholesome foods, worked out regularly, and loyally followed the advice of my cognitive therapy."
4312,"Moreover, I will begin taking seriously the behavioral aspect of the social anxiety therapy I’ve been going through."
4313,"I can't see a doctor, I can't go to therapy."
4314,I cannot go to therapy right now because I'm going abroad soon and my therapist is in another state.
4315,"My therapist said sometimes it's hard to tell, but as I'm sitting here crying at 3 AM I'm not positive about anything."
4316,"I'll have to go home, get a new job, deal with my hectic and very argumentative family, find a new therapist, and be away from my boyfriend (who is the one who convinced me to open up in the first place, making it possible for me to reach out for help)

I'm sorry if this is long, or out of place, or if it just doesn't make sense."
4317,Went to a therapist.
4318,"Hi everyone, I had a terrible day today and decided enough was enough and finally decided to make an appointment with a psychotherapist."
4319,Do I go to regular doctor and they send me to therapist?
4320,"Lost my uncle suddenly to a heart attack when I was young, lost my aunt to a rare complication at 16, two close friends were brutally murdered when I was 26, lost my grandmother earlier this year...

My therapist says we'll dig deeper into that, but for now my struggle with my own mortality and injury seems very real."
4321,"Prior to this therapist I was seeing a CBT therapist in my old city, for 2 years but the connection was never made."
4322,[Celtic Art Therapy](http://www.celticarttherapy.com/celtic-art-therapy-applications/celtic-art-therapy-and-anxiety/)
4323,I have been seeing a therapist who uses traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy.
4324,I have been seeing this therapist for about 8 weeks.
4325,"I started at a 45, and the week I was too busy to do any work for my therapy session was the week that my score was the lowest (28)."
4326,I have not learned one new technique since I started therapy.
4327,"After doing some online research, it appears that acceptance and commitment therapy applies many of these same principles in a structured, therapeutic manner."
4328,"I have never received help for my anxiety, I have wanted therapy but I'm scared honestly that people will think less of me and that I'll think less of myself."
4329,"I've been having anxiety problems for about 3 months now, and i finally went to a therapist yesterday."
4330,I have also been on and off in therapy but about a year ago I began going weekly because my anxiety was so intense.
4331,"At 23, I've spent some time in therapy over the years (never been prescribed an anxiolytic, mainly out of concern due to my alcoholism), and through cognitive behavioral therapy I've learned to use meditation and other relaxation techniques to combat anxiety."
4332,"Three weeks ago, my therapist suggested that I seek group therapy on top of our 1x/week meeting, and found me a group in the area."
4333,That’s when I started going into therapy back home and had almost no contact with anyone but my family.
4334,I'm still in therapy and have no idea how to get better because therapy can only go so far.
4335,I thought I was stable enough that I no longer needed them and was on the outs with my therapist and psychiatrist.
4336,"I started therapy about two months ago, immediately after my break up, and today I saw a very compassionate psychiatrist."
4337,I'm looking into therapy options but I really need short term strategies and help.
4338,"20 yr old female, I have gone to therapy for anxiety before and it helped for a while."
4339,I wish some form of online therapy existed.
4340,"After having no success with therapy, I decided to suck it up and speak to my psychiatrist about my anxiety."
4341,"I used to go to several therapists when I was young, but I never actually told them what I was feeling."
4342,"(I no longer go to any therapists) The weird thing is, whenever I get a panic attack, I get this gagging feeling in my throat."
4343,I visited my therapist today and felt calmer after that.
4344,"I've seen doctors, a psychiatrist, and talked to two therapists about my problems and I'm still not living as happy as I was a year and a half ago."
4345,The doctor also asked if I wanted a recommendation to a therapist and I said yes.
4346,"The office called me a few days later and said they had a month+ wait on their therapist, but she said I have decent insurance and could email me a list of other local therapists."
4347,"It's not exceedingly high, but it does say that OCD is likely above 12.. so I think it's finally time I make the appointment to see a therapist."
4348,"I was wondering if some of you would mind sharing what it's like when you first start seeing a therapist, what to expect, and such."
4349,I am going to go to the doctor today and see what he says and get a therapist recommendation.
4350,"So, after such a success with something that I had been dreading to say for over a year (even had panic attacks about)... My therapist suggested just doing the things you panic over; even when your heart is pounding, because it might actually be helpful."
4351,How do I go about choosing a therapist?
4352,I have started seeing a therapist to work this out.
4353,"I'm in a therapy group for it and seeing a psychiatrist - however, he put me on two medications."
4354,"I'm on Prozac and in therapy and all, but I still get bouts of anxiety when my boyfriend doesn't reply to my messages in a few hours."
4355,I know we aren't doctors or therapists on here but opinions are welcome :)
4356,My therapist and I are working through some emotional things that I really don't want to think about.
4357,But do I push through the stuff in therapy and deal with this anxiety for a while?
4358,"A therapy center has contacted me, and told me that I am mildly depressed, but it's most likely caused by my much more prevalent anxiety."
4359,"I finally was able to see a doctor (something that was always talked about but never acted upon out of mental illness stigma when I had been younger) began a regimen of 40mg Prozac, later added 150mg welbutrin, and semi-weekly cognitive behavioral therapy."
4360,"Extensive professional therapy treatment is something I'd rather be a last resort, as stated, it's not very affordable to me right now."
4361,Would speech therapy or regular therapy be useful?
4362,"This was the original post : http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/34ttox/afraid_to_get_help/

Okay so, I finally decided to call the therapist."
4363,"""You go to a good university, you are goodlooking, have good clothes to wear, eat good food, WHY do you need to see a therapist?"""
4364,I'm in college and I dont earn so I need her money to see a therapist.
4365,"Whatever happens next, all I know is if I do make it to therapy and if it Does improve my life, I'll never be able to forgive her for this."
4366,"I am aware of peer therapy sites, though I haven't had much luck with those."
4367,"I have tried medication, meditation, CT scans, therapy, acupuncture, exercise, aromatherapy, and while a few showed limited success, nothing substantially helped."
4368,"Yesterday my therapist discharged me because we had 5 sessions and hadn't made any progress, but I am very much not better and don't know what to do now."
4369,Is there any way to try a different kind of therapy?
4370,"I don't have the money for a private therapist so I think I would have to try to go through my GP anyways, but what should I say?"
4371,"I've been going to therapy/CBT for about two months now, and it's was helping me quite a bit."
4372,"My grandma (who raised me) died of cancer when I was eight, and I became emetophobic after seeing her suffering through the chemotherapy."
4373,I also started seeing a therapist (I've gone four times over the same time period).
4374,"I've done extensive research on anxiety - medications, alternate treatments, nutrition and exercise therapy -- but with all of these constant physical systems, I don't feel well enough to start anything."
4375,"I've struggled for some years and seen treatment both from a hospital environment and one on one therapy, however reminders and support will be much appreciated."
4376,I have a few weeks till I see a therapist.
4377,I recommend 5-htp it to all anxiety sufferers and those who have problems with rumination that don't want to take prescription medications and/or can't afford traditional therapy (I know I can't as of right now).
4378,"i would recommend seeing someone though, just email a therapist online and go."
4379,A type of therapy?
4380,I've been diagnosed with bipolar II and I'm attending therapy primarily with the hopes of learning to manage the anxiety that's present with my disorder.
4381,This is my first attempt at seeking therapy.
4382,"I'm excited that I found a therapist who does CBT/art therapy that I really, really like."
4383,"I know it's my therapists job to help me figure this shit out, but I wanted to see if anyone had any tips for making the most out of their sessions."
4384,"I've been reaching out to get therapy, so I'm taking small steps at a time."
4385,"I should have noted in my original post that I will be seeking out a doctor or therapist in the near future, I'm not attempting to self-diagnose or self-treat."
4386,I have social anxiety since I was 11 and since 2009 I'm in constant therapy.
4387,"(My therapist says I'm afraid of being wrong, I think it's more that I'm terrified of disagreeing and starting a confrontation)."
4388,"UPDATE: I met with my therapist today and he suggested trying to switch my focus from ""thinking"" to ""doing"" things."
4389,I've already seen 3 therapists in the past and have been on all medications.
4390,"Any tips for wiggling my way out of this one, besides ongoing therapy?"
4391,He sees a therapist that has not given him enough structure or whatever else he needs to overcome this issue.
4392,"He is unwilling to see a new therapist, try new medication, etc, basically anything that'll allow him to cope with this."
4393,I am scheduled to meet with a therapist in two weeks.
4394,"I went in told him my issues and he listened patiently and then to my surprise instead of telling me it wasn't just all in my head or that it was a normal level of anxiety he asked me what I'd like to do about it, and told me that he could write a script for me, or he could write a referral for an anxiety clinic in my city which opens the opportunity for OHIP (Ontario Health insurance) covered therapy."
4395,She rang my doctor almost immediately and wants to book me in for hypnotherapy.
4396,"like during school i had a session with the school counselor a few times and he said i had anxiety, through him saw a therapist like once."
4397,"SO suffers from this debilitating condition, mostly kept in check with therapy and keeping busy."
4398,And me being her support while she goes through treatment and therapy has been the base of our relationship.
4399,My therapist thinks there's some sort of borderline personality or complex PTSD going on.
4400,"I finished therapy a few weeks ago, and I've been on some medication, and I'm feeling so much better."
4401,"So, my therapist and psychiatrist just recommended I train my new puppy to be a service dog."
4402,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
4403,"I've never sought any sort of therapy, and pills are one of the worst fears due to past experiences."
4404,This was the first time after 10 years of having the disorder that I tried using a therapist for treatment.
4405,"Because of my experience with meditation, and the nature of my symptoms, my therapist taught me the following technique and asked me to practice it at home daily, until I became able to practice it during an attack."
4406,"I was doing it to try and shock myself out of low mood and anxiety, and when it started I was forced into therapy."
4407,I was referred twice to two different therapists and both times I gave up because I felt it wasn't helping at all.
4408,My mum convinced me I needed to go to the GP and specifically request for medication seeing as therapy had done nothing for me.
4409,"I know therapy is good at getting to the root of the issue and overcoming it by learning to cope better, but I feel like right now, I am past the point of talking this through."
4410,I'm terrified it'll just be therapy or nothing again.
4411,"We had less than 45 days to rent out our home, get medical clearance for our autistic child, remove him from his established therapists, sell my vehicle, re-home 2 of our pets (which I still cry over), and fly halfway across the world with our remaining 2 pets."
4412,This had all happened before about two years ago but I saw a therapist and she really helped me get through it.
4413,"This time I went back to go see the same therapist and although she has helped, it didn't really seem to help me get back to 100% functionality."
4414,Upon hearing this my therapist recommended that maybe I should see my doctor about it.
4415,I made a therapist appointment for Monday but I'm terrified it's not enough.
4416,I have been going to therapy but honestly.... it hasn't been doing much for me.
4417,"I'm guessing I have to start preparing for blowing out all my feelings on my family, when I start therapy."
4418,"I don't even want to see an sort of therapist, I'm so bad at talking to people in person."
4419,I was referred to a therapist but I haven't called yet.
4420,Is there hope of going off of it after therapy?
4421,"I've also never been to therapy, what happens?"
4422,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
4423,"Im still not capable of doing a lot of things, such as working, and although ive also had therapy since may, im so sick of still experiencing this anxiety."
4424,I wonder whether i should carry on with my 20mg dosage and therapy and see if time helps or ask the doctor whether i can get a higher dosage of citalopram?
4425,"Between seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, and taking medication, I'm doing pretty well with my anxiety."
4426,"Anything besides ""try therapy"" would be greatly appreciated."
4427,"(My step-mom is a psychiatrist, so I don't trust HIPPA or therapists in general)."
4428,"I'm working on reading a CBT book right now, but seeing a therapist/counselor isn't an option for me right now (can't find one that I can both afford and feasibly travel to)."
4429,I've tried going to therapists before and every time they end up useless because I get too scared to actually tell them what's going on with me.
4430,I have tried all sorts of therapy and I think I may have exhausted all medication options.
4431,"I have to make therapy appointments at least a month ahead of time, and that's if I take the first random available appointment (otherwise, it's 6+ weeks)."
4432,**Tl;dr:** How do I deal with missing work for therapy without making it sound like I'm always sick or that I'm making up appointments so I don't have to go in?
4433,"- For the past 3 weeks I have been on a new SSRI (no prior medications for anxiety and depression aside from klonopin) and am currently ""interviewing"" therapists."
4434,"Just take your medicine, see a therapist, and get the dream job later!"""
4435,Or is it more logical to keep taking the SSRI and see a therapist and just wait for it to all magically fall into place one day?
4436,"**

From current relationship/romantic help, to OCD paranoia possibly returning, I know I should be seeing a therapist soon."
4437,"Any suggestions for coping skills, or free therapy (if that's possible)?"
4438,So for almost two years now I have been suffering from what my therapist has diagnosed as severe GAD and Panic disorder.
4439,"I spent several years putting off the idea of going into therapy, telling myself that my problems are too trivial and not worth bothering someone else over, or fearing that I'd be dismissed or that I'd sound stupid talking about my piled up issues and anxiety."
4440,After going in for my 2nd refill of Mirtazapine my doctor gave me a referral to a therapist.
4441,"If you're sitting there contemplating whether you should book a therapist, do it."
4442,"I know all the right things to try to do or think, that my therapist helped me with, but it all becomes irrelevant."
4443,"I did a round of CBT with a therapist, have made a lot of progress, etc."
4444,"I'm in therapy, and trying really hard to get through it, but I just can't stop getting derealised."
4445,I opened up to my therapist but he told my psychiatrist and I feel betrayed.
4446,"It was horrible...  

EDIT: I should have mentioned that I have type 1 diabetes and am on hormone replacement therapy, more specifically I've recently introduced Oestrogen to my body, might be relevant..."
4447,I'm seeing therapists.
4448,I've been doing exposure therapy and CBT.
4449,"after doing some reading on the internet, speaking to a therapist 1-2 times, worked my way through it."
4450,"As an Atlanta suffer of severe depression and a plethora of other system, depression, including ACT.My system have been diagnosed as Intractable migraine along with server depression, bipolar type 2 ii and they are giving me pain medicatoin which cause lightheartedness and nausea.I have approach both my of therapist with other remedies such a deep brain stimpulatior andor hallucination via LSH or psilocybin."
4451,My therapist said my homework was to identify a situation that makes me feel anxious and then ask myself if there was anything more I could do that I haven't already done.
4452,I brought her with me to therapy last night in hopes of solving a financial situation she is in and it did not go well.
4453,"I'm really hoping that Zoloft, in conjunction with my meditation and therapy, will make a positive difference."
4454,yes im taking medication and even seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist.
4455,"Due to that, I developed very bad hypochondria and OCD (self diagnosed)  
Finally in 2013 I was prescribed Klonopin by my PMD , got rid of the shitty “just drink your problems away and then come to me so I can tell you your issues aren’t bad” therapist,  Fall of 2013 went to a legit therapist and Rx klonopin and an antidepressant so I am clinically depressed and have generalized anxiety disorder."
4456,"I dropped out of college, twice, because I did not have solid coping strategies for my anxiety and trauma related issues, for which I both receive therapy now."
4457,"I've been seeing a therapist for my anxiety and she suggested that I see a psychiatrist about being put on antidepressants, in order to subdue my anxiety enough to start making real progress in therapy."
4458,I don't think my mom wants me to go to a therapist because it costs too much and my family can't really afford any new medical bills since my grandma is sick.
4459,"And I do not want 'don't worry, it gets better, I cured my chronic anxiety with years of therapy and underwater bikram yoga!'"
4460,I recently went to my first therapy session and have an appointment with a sleep coach.
4461,"I'd been too sick on Monday to see my therapist, but on Wednesday, I finally felt good enough to make the long drive out there."
4462,"I left YouTube running while I drove, and I talked to my therapist about everything that had happened, and it really *did* feel good to get it off my chest."
4463,(I'm lucky to have a particularly compassionate therapist).
4464,"After two years of therapy and a lot of introspection, I believe it's related to repressed grief over my father's death (cancer) when I was 13 years-old that later manifested itself after a bad break-up."
4465,I started seeing a therapist immediately.
4466,I took to therapy very well.
4467,I did all the homework and exercises my therapist asked me to do.
4468,"Since I've had my therapy sessions (went for two years, but no longer go due to insurance reasons), I've only had two panic attacks which is awesome."
4469,"I've had therapy recommended to me before but I couldn't go because they could only offer me group sessions, and in order to get on them I would have had to literally phone the people and say, ""Hi, I want to be in therapy."""
4470,"I have considered seeing a therapist, but I am not worried or anxious about anything, I live a pretty happy life and all of this came out of nowhere."
4471,"It rules my life, I try my best to left it not, I go to therapy, I take medications as needed, I have cbt therapy work books I use, I've even turned to religion."
4472,I had a CBT therapist back home and it really helped.
4473,"My insurance only covers back home, but I can rarely find actual doctors that take it, so finding a therapist is not happening."
4474,"So, after seeing 10-12 different psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, and councellors and after being hospitalized for long periods of time including one time for two months where I was sexually taken advantage of by a staff member and a patient, I decided to stop putting my future in the hands of others and moved."
4475,"so here goes without going into much detail...

my girlfriend has some social anxiety issues that she takes some pills for and is waiting to see a therapist."
4476,I told him to go to his therapist tomorrow but he doesn't like medications because it makes him angry.
4477,I've seen countless therapists and have been on prozac for years.
4478,"I really want to find a therapist, but I'm so afraid that I'll have nothing to say to them."
4479,I have a good therapist.
4480,I've went to a mental health therapist and it helped some but a lot of my anxiety is just physical symptoms.
4481,I am 21 and it had been 8 years since I started the whirlwind of therapy.
4482,Years ago I attempted therapy for about 6 months right after my parents announced they were getting separated.
4483,My significant other of 1.5 years has gone through therapy and came out a much better person (having other issues) and has been pushing me to return.
4484,"Since I'm in a new area I don't have a general practitioner to go see...I don't know if I need to start with that, or just find a therapist nearby to call up and say ""Hi, I'm anxious.""."
4485,"I am seeing a therapist through my university (that's all I can afford at the moment), and I'm a 20 year old male."
4486,"I'm doing my best to try and accept that death is a mandatory phase in life and that I can't always know the answer to all these questions, but I want to know if there's any way I can calm down about these topics in addition to meds and therapy."
4487,"So long story short, I had a really bad week last week anxiety and depression wise thankfully I saw my therapist/doctor on Tuesday and she changed up my meds."
4488,I'm scheduled to see a therapist soon but in the meantime what can I do?
4489,So last week I had a panic attack at my therapist and I was pretty annoyed because of it.
4490,I have a doctors appt Monday to get some xanex my therapist recommended.
4491,My therapist and psychologist I see now say I just have anxiety and depression and I agree with them.
4492,I would’ve figured after having forced family therapy sessions over the past 7 years they would have noticed that screaming at me makes things worse for me.
4493,"I've encouraged her to go to therapy, but she insists she is too busy."
4494,"I've recently turned 18, and also just completed my therapy sessions."
4495,Basically therapy was amazing for me.
4496,Let's call my therapist Lisa.
4497,"The only advice I've been given is exposure therapy, just keep doing it and give no fucks until it gets better."
4498,"I do suffer from anxiety in social situations but it's not bad (meaning I'm not seeking therapy or medication, i just lack social skills and talking to people makes me very nervous)."
4499,I have an appointment scheduled with my therapist on 10/29 and my psychiatrist on 11/7.
4500,CB therapy every 2 weeks; my therapist recommended attending Cog Support Group and going to my psychiatrist's.
4501,I've read on here multiple times that therapy can work great and I have just had my first session with yet another counselor and I'm wondering if people have any tips on what to look for in a counselor or stories to share that might help me get a better sense early on if the sessions will be useful?
4502,"I see a therapist bi weekly and I have consulted with my primary care physician about this issue, with little to no improvement."
4503,"Because my parents are always bailing him out of shit he caused, when I've needed help with paying for therapy and medication they've had to tell me no because they gave all their money to fucking Kevin and they can't afford to help me."
4504,"I'm doing all kind of stuff to try to get better, I go to yoga, gym, do breathing excercises, I've read books, watched many videos...
And recently started going to a new therapist, I had some sessions last year with a different one but didn't feel it helped me."
4505,"So the thing is, my therapist says there must be a root to my anxiety and I just don't think so, I had a very normal chilhood and just ok teenage years."
4506,My social anxiety started when I was about 5 years old (I'm 23 now) and I just started therapy for the first time.
4507,"I'm pretty much terrified of even thinking about exposing myself to my fears and even though my therapist has only suggested ""small"" and relatively ""simple"" exposures I've been too scared to try them."
4508,I also can't afford therapy of any kind because I'm not exactly well off with out my job.
4509,"I’m not looking for long-term solutions like therapy, SSRIs, or other things that typically take weeks or months to see benefits from, as I’ve tried many of these already with mixed results and am really just looking for ideas to alleviate or lessen anxiety right away while it’s actually happening."
4510,I've been struggling as a student in the past to afford the $40 weekly insurance copay at another therapist that I thought was not effective.
4511,I am going to a therapist this time to talk about it.
4512,"I finally went to a therapist about it and told her everything I could think of - my dermatillomania, my self-doubt and self-image issues, lots of things."
4513,"My therapist listened to everything and said, ""Well, all signs point to a case of anxiety."""
4514,Both my doctor and my therapist have pushed for me to do an SSRI.
4515,"It looks like 6 months of medication, life changes and therapy is finally starting to pay off..."
4516,"Inspired by positive response I saw to a thread on /r/depression where someone suggested 'speed dating' therapists and then choosing one based on that experience, I wanted to try an experiment where I set up these speed dating sessions for people based on some basic info they provide."
4517,"If you're currently looking for a therapist and interested in being a part of this, I'd love to hear thoughts."
4518,I'm looking in to getting therapy but it feels like a defeat since my anxiety was much more manageable for so long.
4519,"According to my therapist, this may be a sign it's not working as after 8 weeks you definitely should feel a change."
4520,"Regarding the therapist:

I was incredibly lucky to find a therapist that does behavioural therapy as well as depth psychology (the classic  ""is your childhood responsible for all that"" basically)."
4521,"So to summarize: The meds probably aren't working as intended, and I'm not sure my therapist is the right guy for me."
4522,I'm going to start speaking to a therapist hopefully soon.
4523,"I've seen numerous therapists and am currently taking Lamictal and Abilify in unison to quell my mood swings and general anxiety, as well as a panic medication for when the panic attacks start to set in."
4524,"Got some therapy, helped to an extent."
4525,The only real reason I can see for trying is because I would be totally lost if I lost my therapist and I'm not going to have her as a support forever.
4526,i've been on medication/therapy off and on (90% on) for 15 years.
4527,"I've tried medication, and therapy and neither worked."
4528,"I have begun meditation, exercising regularly, and therapy and they have all been fairly helpful!"
4529,"I know that if I am prescribed a therapy animal and my landlord found out I had a cat, even though he is against it, I legally can not be evicted."
4530,"I am very nervous about talking to my doctor about having a therapy cat, i don't want to feel silly for it, especially when I tell him I don't want to use medication to treat my anxiety."
4531,I guess I am just looking for stories/examples/advice on getting a therapy cat recommendation/ prescription from my psychiatrist to ease my nerves.
4532,I have a history with depression but I'm hesitant to seek therapy in light of being accused of faking (ha!)
4533,"So, I really want to get therapy, but I have no idea where to start?"
4534,"Do I consult my doctor first, or look for a nearby therapist?"
4535,I have very bad anxiety and compulsive thoughts which I take regular meds for and currently get CBT therapy.
4536,"Throughout the past year, I have been making healthy lifestyle changes and going to see the school therapist when things got extra rocky and I have been getting better."
4537,"I talked with the counselor about regular therapy the rest of this year and summer, maybe medication."
4538,"I talked to my psychotherapist, and was prescribed beta blockers."
4539,"Since a therapy 5 years ago and my daily dose of 15mg seroplex, life has been better."
4540,"I see either a doctor, therapist, case manager, or psychiatrist nearly ever day."
4541,I see a psychotherapist once a week.
4542,I have a fantastic DO whom referred me to the therapist.
4543,"I have had all of these symptoms for 8-10 years, and my parents always just dumped me into a therapists office."
4544,"I have seen 4 different therapists, and none helped at all."
4545,I was still in CBT for GAD &amp; SAD and my therapist agreed with me that the only way I would go out was if I had a real reason to.
4546,"After a few weeks of having a new family member, I had my last therapy session."
4547,I know my therapist was worried about me.
4548,I've gotton better by educating myself (I can't afford drugs or therapy) but for some reason I'm getting bad.
4549,I saw a new therapist last summer.
4550,"We discussed my syptoms and she reccomended that I begin a therapy group, and then if I was still experiencing syptoms after 2 months then to call her, which then she would recommend medication."
4551,"So, I went to group therapy for 2 months."
4552,"Now, I went to a phsychiatry department (Kaiser) for therapy with her and for group therapy."
4553,"I could have easily called the office and asked to see a new therapist, but I didn't."
4554,"I'm working a second seasonal job that ends next month, so when that ends and I have more time, I'm going to start therapy again and hopefully try medication."
4555,I'm planning on going to a new therapist and really refocus on addressing these issues.
4556,Do I need to see a therapist first?
4557,"My experience of therapy is that it's a fascinating discussion about WHY I'm anxious and how my mind is working, but doesn't fix anything."
4558,"I guess I want to know what it is that therapy can actually offer, other than an interesting chat about things I've usually worked out for myself?"
4559,"They replied with calling me a controlling bitch, that I'm ruining the 'best holiday of his life', that talking to me is like talking to a brick wall, and that I should go into therapy before I do any more damage."
4560,Im on new health insurance now so I cant see my old therapist I saw over the summer who was pretty cool.
4561,"I'm seeing a therapist, but I can't call her 24/7."
4562,I thought perhaps a self-therapy method would be to start blogging about my usage.
4563,"I've been seeing a therapist lately to talk through the anxiety which has been great, but he asked for me to go back to the doctor to see if there are any other things I could try medication-wise."
4564,"Btw Yes I've done therapy, been to a psych hospital, and I'm on medication."
4565,I saw a therapist who specializes in anxiety disorders (10 sessions).
4566,I'm thinking of visiting a hypnotherapist.
4567,"""(I'm going to school to become a therapist)."
4568,Do I just call a therapist's office and make an appointment?
4569,"Btw, I've gone to a therapist a few times, and I'm unmedicated."
4570,"I was seeing a therapist, but it fizzled out."
4571,"Does anyone have any strategies for beating the ""social"" part of anxiety that doesn't require intense therapy and medication?"
4572,It was entirely the ddecision of my GP and my therapist to give me it and try it.
4573,I have had anxiety for years and neither therapy nor drugs have helped.
4574,I really should get into therapy but I'm too anxious to even do that.
4575,Call it self therapy.
4576,"I called a therapist today because my sister feels i should talk to a professional about everything, decided to write my story on reddit while i had a bit of anxiety; phone calls, even with family gives me anxiety."
4577,"I texted my therapist, hoping to be able to see her tomorrow but she's unavailable."
4578,"I saw a therapist for over 5 years and it really helped for a day or so, but I lost my insurance about 4 months ago."
4579,"So for the past 8-10 years I have been in therapy, tests and other fun things."
4580,On Tuesday I am going to see a psychologist for an evaluation for therapy... again.
4581,"ETA: i am on 50mg of prozac and up until recently attended therapy (stopped because i am going to college 5+ hours away), if that matters."
4582,"About 5 months ago, after one too many embarrassing moments, I started trying medication again after years off of therapy and meds because of some bad experiences and general ineffectiveness."
4583,"I started reading blogs, and seeing a CBT therapist, and changing the way I thought."
4584,"I've been going to doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, two support groups a week and I'm finally starting to feel a bit better but I'm trying to get adjusted to my new medication and I feel constantly sick and gross."
4585,I woke up to two missed calls from my doctor and my therapist.
4586,"So after seeing a therapist for 5 months and then seeing a new one yesterday (due to the fact that I turned 18, my medical provider requires I see an adult psychologist instead of a children's one) I've discovered that therapy (and maybe just talking about my feelings/issues/mental problems in general) FREAKS ME OUT."
4587,"Everytime I go to therapy and we get to talking about myself and my mental health and how I've been doing, I panic."
4588,(Not sure if the therapist notices or not.)
4589,"So anyways, my new therapist signed me up for some type of ""anxiety class,"" where I guess it's sort of like a group therapy about dealing with anxiety."
4590,"This plan sounds just peachy, except I'm SO WORRIED that I'll end up freaking out like I do with regular therapy, and the classes won't work for me at all and they'll just make me feel worse."
4591,"Anyways, I'm just really worried about therapy in general, and could use any tips or insights."
4592,"(I don't think I'll be having any individual therapy for a while though, just the group classes, but I don't know how it will all work out.)"
4593,"I talked to a school counselor about my health anxiety and how death fucking scares me, but so far the therapy isn't helping and I feel like I'm forcing myself to go there to only satisfy my counselor (she wants me to meet every Thursday but I don't want to go because I'd rather do other things..."
4594,"I have since gone to therapy, found ways to manage my stress, and have a better hold on my life."
4595,"My mother, my therapist, and my friends disagreed."
4596,I saw a therapist for the first time in my early teens.
4597,My therapist thinks it would be good for me to have as needed anxiety meds but my regular doctor wont give them to me.
4598,I am also on therapy (once per week) and take trazodone (100mg per day) and librax (5mg every day).
4599,My therapist says you can go to sleep with tense muscles or become tense at night and that it can cause pain.
4600,"I'm afraid to go to a therapist, because I suspect I wouldn't be taken seriously given my high grades and the fact that I get more sleep and do less work than most people at my school as is."
4601,"My mother worked with me to drop band (which I was certain was causing most of my stress), took me to a doctor to get medicine, and helped set up therapy (first real session tomorrow)."
4602,"So I have tried, yoga, meditation, acupuncture, reiki, massage, acupressure, therapy, exercising, even tried some less legal relaxation... but nothing seems to help me get to the source of where all the anxiety is coming from."
4603,I basically feel like I don't suffer enough to go to therapy.
4604,"I'm pretty sure I have some kind of anxiety issue that's gotten worse, but I still feel as though a therapist wouldn't take me seriously."
4605,"My boyfriend recently suggested that I seek therapy because I have a lot of trouble expressing myself and I've gone through phases of self-harming, but I feel stressed out and doubtful knowing: A) What if I really don't need therapy and I just look like I'm seeking attention?"
4606,"I am thinking about seeing a therapist, even though I dont really want to."
4607,Do I say therapist.
4608,I have begun seeing a therapist for a couple of appointments now but I'm not sure if they are the right fit for me.
4609,"Now, though, having thought that I'd overcome things with a little bit of self-inflicted exposure therapy (i.e."
4610,"Then, it got so bad that I had to do intensive outpatient therapy, and I was given Cymbalta and Seroquel or some combo like that."
4611,"I have a great therapist who has given me all the tools I need to cope with my anxiety; CBT is super-great, as a side note!"
4612,"I was going around and around with my therapist, describing how I wanted to try EMDR to help eliminate some of my driving anxiety and panic attacks."
4613,"*


Lately my therapist and I have been working on some ways to battle anxiety and heal the brain and body without the use of dependent medications."
4614,I don't really want to visit a therapist or anyone for that matter.
4615,"tl;dr: don't want therapy, just want meds"
4616,I am seeing a therapist and taking medication which is helping immensely.
4617,"i am confident enough in my progress that i want to try to meet new people, test what i have learned in therapy and make some friends."
4618,"I've always had general anxiety, but never went to a therapist or anything because most of the time I am able to handle it."
4619,I'm going to a therapist so my anxiety is getting better but in little steps.
4620,Talk to your doctor about therapy and other solutions before jumping on meds.
4621,"Anyone have techniques, coping methods, therapy?"
4622,"There, I followed a strict schedule of pointless group therapy with recovering drug addicts and murderer wannabes."
4623,"The counselors ""graded"" how we behaved, how often we participated in group therapy, how much we ate, and how we dressed."
4624,"""when is the novelty of dating a girl in dire need of a therapist going to wear off?"""
4625,She asked me some basic questions and said I could have an appointment but the Doctor would not give me medication without therapy.
4626,"I just want to see a doctor, not feel like I am bothering anyone by doing so, and I am new to the area so I don't have a therapist."
4627,"I see the sidebar mentions that if anxiety is interfering with my life I should get an evaluation and therapy, but I can't see that as an option without my parent's support."
4628,And in a month or so I plan on starting talk therapy again.
4629,"I'm not medicated (but might be in the next couple weeks), and don't have a therapist."
4630,So I was just diagnosed with GAD today and my councilor suggested going on a medication before we start therapy next semester.
4631,"The other day my therapist suggested writing down all thoughts, worries, and anxieties on my mind before going to bed."
4632,"I'm seeing a therapist I like now (2nd one in my lifetime), and it feels good to talk about things, but idk if it's really ""helping."""
4633,"Anyway, my therapist asked me recently if I'd considered trying medication."
4634,My therapist thinks my anxiety is largely genetic/biological.
4635,All the therapy I've done... and all the things I've read say that I am wrong.
4636,"trying to feel normal but I don't really have money for therapy, and I've never managed to get any good from therapist."
4637,"Say for me to go on antidepressants, beta blockers or CBT (Cognotive behaviour therapy)."
4638,Sort of self therapy.
4639,"I don't have a therapist, don't take meds, and for the most part have just dealt with periods of anxiousness with yoga, keeping away from public situations, and occasionally stress-eating popcorn."
4640,"I am looking into therapy options, but any more natural or diy tactics are very appreciated."
4641,"My therapist gave me an sort of ultimatum this week, she said I can continue therapy which she said could be up to a year plus or I can be prescribed medication."
4642,Would you recommend medicine or therapy?
4643,"I dont think I am a good candidate for therapy, as I work in therapy.."
4644,I'm going to talk to my therapist about it but I won't be seeing him until late next month.
4645,"I wasn't diagnosed until I was 19, because I watched ""A Beautiful Mind"" and similar things at a young age, and thought that I was crazy and would be taken away and submitted to shock ""therapy""."
4646,"At 19, I finally went to a therapist, who told me to see a psychiatrist."
4647,"I have been seeing a therapist who has helped me discover that basically it's not so much me thats the problem, it's the workplace - it's toxic."
4648,"I have a doctors appointment (GP) tomorrow but I don't know exactly what to tell him, my therapist and I have tried a range of things but she basically said to me that if it gets worse or keeps up at the range it is that the only other options are medication or to leave my job."
4649,"I started showing symptoms for an anxiety disorder (I'm still ""undiagnosed"" because I've only been to a psychiatrist; not a therapist) a year and a half ago (October 2012)."
4650,"I will, hopefully (if Coventry Health Care covers it), see a therapist to get a full evaluation."
4651,"General info [24/f, 25 on Friday], medications: klonopin &amp; lamictal (have been working well for the most part), therapy: none, was told I was rational enough to work my problems out alone by a therapist."
4652,I've been in and out of therapy since I was 7.
4653,"I try to make note of them as they come up, to give to my (future) therapist."
4654,I know I need therapy harcore.
4655,"I meant to ask my therapist but I forgot - and google didnt turn up any useful results for me, but do you know if it is safe to take gravol while taking Prozac (or any anti-anxiety meds really...) I don't take any other medications, but I dont want to mess with this is gravol isn't good to mix."
4656,"With cognitive therapy/meds, I have gotten a clearer view of this disorder and taken control back in my life (mostly)."
4657,"It's been 30 minutes of crying about nothing, My jaw hurts, i can barely breath and I have to leave for an appointment with my therapist in 10 minutes."
4658,Or at least I think  that's where my CB therapist would catch me- which is part of the reason I'm looking for advice from you guys.
4659,"My therapist has been asking me if I could just live in the moment, just feel during that moment, without any worries or fears."
4660,I see my therapist next Friday for the first time in a month.
4661,"I have an appointment with a therapist to start some medication and do CBT next Tuesday, but lately things have been getting so much worse."
4662,"I started going to therapy for anxiety and then I think I scared him with something I said, with how clingy I was and we didn't talk for awhile before eventually I said something else to him finally and he said how he couldn't be my friend and just cut off all contact with me."
4663,"After some therapy, I've been doing a lot better with anxiety in my regular life, but I'm still fat."
4664,"I've been dealing with anxiety in some form for some time now (which I only realized with therapy), perhaps a few years, and it only ever feels like it's getting worse."
4665,"I have been in therapy, but it never lessens the anxiety I have."
4666,"Medication was suggested at one point by an older therapist, but right now I'm starting with a new therapist (due to appointment restrictions with the old one), and it hasn't come back up."
4667,I'm about a month into intensive outpatient therapy for anxiety.
4668,"He doesn't believe that therapy will help him, and I'm not sure how to convince him otherwise."
4669,"He's not taking medication for his anxiety, and as I said he doesn't believe in therapy."
4670,"I guess I should contact my therapist, who I've kind of been blowing off because I don't want to think through a lot of painful things and because she's pregnant and going to leave soon anyway and then I won't have a therapist again so ugh."
4671,"I have been using Xanax since August 2013 almost daily to cope as well as seeing a therapist, but due to insurance had to stop the therapy."
4672,"He's had weekly appointments with the local mental health nurse, been in low-intensity (telephone) CBT and high-intensity (face-to-face) CBT therapy, and has been on antidepressants since diagnosis."
4673,"In the spring of 2013, I met up with a therapist, but I didn't like her very much."
4674,"However, in late spring, I switched to a new place that had both therapists and psychiatrists because I decided that I needed medicine now."
4675,My new therapist was really great and I was diagnosed with panic disorder.
4676,"When I next saw my therapist, she asked about my grandmother, and though I didn't think I would, I broke down crying there."
4677,"Don't be afraid to see a therapist, they aren't going to judge you, they see people with all sorts of problems every day and they're there to help you."
4678,My therapist told me many of her patients need to switch their medicine 3-4 times before they find the right one for them.
4679,I want to begin therapy but I'm not sure how to find a therapist?
4680,Do insurance companies have a process for referring their clients to therapists?
4681,"I'm currently in therapy with a good counselor, and my doctor prescribed me Xanax, but I'd rather not take it since I'd get addicted incredibly fast."
4682,I see a therapist currently and I've never been given like a diagnosis to my anxiety.
4683,"Examples:

- I worry an awful lot that my psychologist will forget to refer me to a therapist."
4684,I saw the psychologist on Friday last week and she said she'd email or call me when she's referred me or when she's referred me and the therapist has confirmed he's gotten the referral (don't remember which one).
4685,I've tried therapy once before and that didn't go well because of the therapist and last time they sort of lost my referral so I had to wait much longer than expected before getting to see a therapist.
4686,"I finally talked to my parents about seeing a therapist, but the task of finding one rests on me so it's going to take some time."
4687,"So I've been in therapy for a while now, and just having trouble articulating to my therapist how my anxiety is triggered."
4688,"I attended therapy for a year and I made huge progress, to the point now where I enjoy being around people, my favorite part of my job is talking to people, etc."
4689,"It's getting better with time in steps, so I don't believe medication/therapy are necessary for me (NOT knocking either in any way!)"
4690,"I went to therapy for about 3 years (16-19) and took many, many medications, and hated every single one."
4691,"Every cup of coffee is a therapy session, and it has helped me make my way back to some level of normalcy."
4692,"I've [read](http://pets1.knoji.com/how-cats-help-humans-with-anxiety/) a [few](http://www.examiner.com/article/five-reasons-for-why-having-a-cat-can-help-reduce-your-stress) different [articles](http://www.catster.com/lifestyle/cat-behavior-cats-therapy-anxiety-depression-in-kids-children) about [cats](http://www.hopetocope.com/Item.aspx/656/the-power-of-pets) (or [pets](http://www.sheknows.com/health-and-wellness/articles/804221/cats-are-good-for-your-health) in [general](http://pets.webmd.com/ss/slideshow-pets-improve-your-health)) helping people with anxiety (or depression, stress, etc), and I was wondering, have any of you purchased a cat for this reason, and if so, does a cat really help?"
4693,"I've recently felt like I've gotten my feelings of anxiety under control with some therapy, but I can't seem to shake the random nausea."
4694,Things do get better with time and I think the behavioural therapy I've gone through has helped.
4695,I don't know what to do to help it and i don't want to go therapy and get tablet because just the thought of it feels depressing.
4696,"I have been in therapy for about 7 years now, I do CBT with an OCD specialist."
4697,"I'm in therapy, so I've got someone to talk to, and I've also got some tools to handle it okay."
4698,I am trying to find a good therapist nearby to go and talk to.
4699,"I have resisted for so long because the last two therapists I went to did nothing to help me and basically told me, ""It's not normal to think like that, you have to stop thinking like that!"""
4700,but didn't help me with any useful therapy.
4701,Lets contribute our ideas and formulate a collective method or therapy to free ourselves and help others.
4702,"Please help

Edit: I've done some therapy, and talked about it with my psychologist, but I've come to no avail."
4703,Has anyone on here had success with cognitive therapy?
4704,Any success with cognitive therapy?
4705,"but the rest of my family are here, this is home, my dogs (who have been my saving grace and are my children) won't be able to go with me, I will be renting a room and living with other people (which the thought of induces anxiety all on its own) for the first time in almost ten years, and I'll be leaving behind my therapist and my doctors and my closest friends :/ 

on the other hand...I need a change, desperately...my closest friends are here but we rarely see each other as they're all married/have kids, I cannot for the life of me seem to find work down here, I feel lonely and depressed most days because I don't have much to do...but I'm comfortable with that in a way 

now i have a friend who is gonna be moving here for her residency/fellowship and it will be amazing to finally get to hang out with her and I'm the only person she knows here, so it'll be good for her too!"
4706,I set up an appointment with a therapist tomorrow and I don't feel anything at all towards it.
4707,"Next I got to see a CBT therapist, because i wasn't really doing anything or attempting to do anything just depressed scared and confused I don't really feel i got much out of this other then perhaps a slight push in the right direction."
4708,After this my doctor put allot of pressure into getting me a therapist.
4709,"They had to updose me every year, but I got therapy and got released because I hadn't had any panic attacks in years (thanks to Ativan I guess), but therapist gave me ""tools"" (splashing water on my face; etc)."
4710,"I've been susceptible to anxiety since I was little, and had the worst of it in high school... severe panic attacks multiple times a week... Now, after therapy and self-help, I'm better, I don't panic so often."
4711,I want self therapy solutions.
4712,"I'm seeing a psychiatrist, trying different meds, and a therapist, but nothing is working so far."
4713,"I've pretty much finally come to the conclusion (Long story, a lot of thought and just a few situations) that I need help in tackling my anxiety head on (Both meds/therapy probably)."
4714,I saw two therapist for about 8 months.
4715,So here is my advice: if therapy isn't working or you have a family history of the illness (which I did) give medication a shot!
4716,Last week I told my S/O I was going to see a doctor (told her it was a regular doctor even though I am going to see a therapist) because I had been dealing with panik attacks recently.
4717,"I've known I've had a BED for a half a year now, and whenever I'd visit my mother in Jersey, I'd stop by the ED counselor and try to make her therapy stick while I was back in DC with my father."
4718,"I have tried therapy in the past, and maybe it is time to try it again."
4719,"I'm fine with being alone...at least for now)

I did meet a psychologist(not a doctor, more like a therapist) for over 15 sessions last year."
4720,"To be honest, I think this anxiety can be attributed to switching therapists."
4721,"Six weeks ago I left my old therapist, which was the right call despite our good relationship (I had not improved for months with him after a four years of seeing him)."
4722,"However, I have had a hard time finding a new therapist that is a good match for me (though I'm.optimistic about one I'll be seeing Thursday)."
4723,"My old therapist was really my only human contact of any meaning outside of my immediate family, so I think that's why my anxiety has been skyrocketing."
4724,"I started seeing a new therapist in March and she's been REALLY helpful, but it's still so hard to just keep my head up and calm down some days."
4725,I haven't been able to see my therapist in two weeks and I've been feeling really shitty for the last few days.
4726,"I'm seeing my therapist again on Friday and I honestly can't wait, because I started slowly getting better until I wasn't able to see her for two weeks."
4727,"I've spent a lot of time and money in therapy, I've changed my lifestyle, my diet, etc."
4728,"When I first sought help for anxiety back in college, my therapist and doctor put me on a combination of Lexapro, weekly CBT, and daily mindfulness meditation."
4729,"When the therapist would occasionally guide me in mindfulness during my therapy session, it would improve my whole day."
4730,"I also really hate how my therapist, or the voice of the guided meditations on calm.com, would tell me I needed to sit a certain way or with specific posture or breathe just so."
4731,"Anyway, after college I stopped going to therapy, got off meds, etc."
4732,Is there some meditation therapy/self help I should try?
4733,She started taking celexia in a very mild dose and will see a therapist tomorrow so I'm hoping that will help.
4734,I went to a therapist yesterday and he only told me it was caused by surpressed emotions.
4735,You were all really helpful and it helped me gain some confidence and talk to my therapist about it.
4736,"I tried the find a therapist link, and google to no avail!"
4737,"This is a doozy, so...
&gt;TL;DR: Suffer anxiety and depression, therapy is bad or keeps getting cancelled for weird, understandable reasons, and now I feel really helpless."
4738,"Despite being told I should seek professional help, I never went because I was still under my parents' insurance, they aren't from america and don't understand mental health, and I didn't have any money to pay for a therapist out of pocket."
4739,"After my girlfriend put up with me and the horrible anxiety I have starting to put a strain on our relationship, it was finally time to give in and look for a therapist."
4740,"I'm looking for a therapist #3 in attempts to maybe fill in the gap, but I'm already nervous and anxious about calling them (I've been using mostly email up until this point)."
4741,"I was severely depressed/anxious the other night and tried to use blahtherapy.com but I got matched with someone absolutely awful who basically said I might end up abusing someone I love/""pulling a knife on them""."
4742,"Shit like this happens way too often and although I'm doing CBT, it is very hard for me to expose myself to even the most simple situations like visiting the post office, thus making progress in therapy very difficult."
4743,I'm seeing a therapist once a week and even a physical therapist to help me with breathing and relaxing.
4744,EDIT: My therapist diagnosed me with GAD.
4745,I actually visited a psychologist (therapist?)
4746,"I'm not on medication, I'm not in therapy, I'm not ready to accept that kind of help."
4747,I'm seeing both a therapist and doctor about this but neither really seem to be helping all that much.
4748,I never told anyone IRL about it aside from a therapist.
4749,I am finally in a financial position where I'm comfortable paying for therapy.
4750,"Prior to this, the closest I ever got to getting a therapist was having someone else call for me, them obviously being told I had to be the one to call, and then me calling only to start crying before I said anything and hanging up."
4751,"And that's the optimistic ones, there's a few therapists that I like the sound of who don't list anything but a number or an email and somehow it's even worse to think about messaging them blindly."
4752,"The only way you will truly see a real benefit in your condition is the right medications, the right therapist, and the right lifestyle changes."
4753,I've gone to therapy monthly for the last four years and I've taken several different meds in very regimented ways while working closely with my family doctor.
4754,I live too far from a town to be able to make therapy group visits and I don't even think I could handle it in my current mental state anyway.
4755,"I don't see my friends anymore, I can't go more than a block or two walking without getting anxious, I can't bike more than three or four blocks without getting anxious, and if I get in the car with someone I start panicking as soon as I get out of my comfortable walking range (because I'm not in control), I haven't been able to see my therapist in a couple weeks because I have no way to get to the appointments..."
4756,"Anyway, I guess I just need some affirmation that therapy could actually help me."
4757,"A therapist or psychiatrist or whatever might tell me that this is the aftermath of being ""sexually abused"" (I hate to call it that, I don't think I consider it that, but yet again a different story)."
4758,"I take medication for it, 40mg of propranolol twice a day and I have my first therapy session on Monday with a CBT."
4759,Well I started this journey to get over my anxiety back in January without medicines (I came off of Celexa officially in April) and therapy.
4760,Also also I am going  back to therapy to confront this phobia once and for all (something I have never done before).
4761,I can only talk in fron of the therapist is I'm level headed and not too emotional.
4762,I was referred by my GP to see a CBT therapist because of Generalized Anxiety Disorder.
4763,"My therapist managed to motivate me to start exercising, and the benefits were immediately clear to me."
4764,"I genuinely want to get better, I see a therapist, but seeing as my luck never seems to get better I just don't see a reason to hope."
4765,"I have always felt sad, like I have seen a therapist on and off for 4 years."
4766,The doctor has suggested on therapy to compliment the medication.
4767,I'm sorry this is long but there's no such thing as a free therapist so I'm on here.
4768,I have one therapy appointment left before school starts.
4769,YOU are the one who started me on therapy and medication.
4770,"My therapist is an amazing woman, and has helped me so much."
4771,My therapist recommended I see a therapist that specializes in EMDR therapy to help me release the trapped feelings in my nervous system (an explanation from the Web).
4772,"I've told her stuff I've been too embarrassed to tell anybody else, including therapists."
4773,"She knows about my depression and anxiety and has told me to see a therapist (which I have seen my fair share in the past, but am in between therapists right now)."
4774,She comes back saying that she's told me a therapist and there's nothing she can do.
4775,I've suffered from depression and general anxiety (more towards social anxiety) and through the last few years I've worked through most of the issues through the help of therapy and lifestyle changes like working out.
4776,"I've had plenty of therapy and medicine for depression in my past so I understand pretty well how to talk myself down from over-thinking, usually."
4777,I also make a therapy appointment for this week.
4778,We've gotten her to agree to see another (different) therapist (first meeting today).
4779,I plan on seeing a therapist for the first time to get cured 100% hopefully but we'll see.
4780,I am trying to work up the courage to see a therapist at which point I can get a more definitive answer.
4781,I have a couple of friends that have gone to therapy and have loved it.
4782,"I've always known that therapy was a good treatment option, but have never felt like it was the right thing for me as I'm not that much of a talker."
4783,"My question is... 
What made you finally decide to go to therapy?"
4784,What would you suggest to someone just starting therapy?
4785,"So I've been working on trying to treat my anxiety for awhile now and I've been researching some alternative therapies (I'm super susceptible to any drugs, even caffeine or Advil or something) to try and alleviate my most intense anxiety thought processes and symptoms."
4786,If I go to a therapist I know exactly what they will tell me so that doesn't help either.
4787,But one of my sons has a speech delay and will be starting speech therapy soon.
4788,"We're not sure how often his therapy will be, the speech Therapist hasn't assessed the severity yet but did say to expect it at least once a week."
4789,"Not to mention, we will have our third baby in March and along with my sons speech therapy, I will have several OB appointments and then appointments ffor the new little guy."
4790,"The speech therapist, the one closest to us, is 45 minutes away."
4791,"The only ideas I have so far are to spend my therapy sessions driving with my therapist, or to ask my mom or dad to accompany me until I get used to driving again."
4792,**tl;Dr: I have terrible anxiety driving but need to get over it so I can take my son to his frequent speech therapy appointments**
4793,"And yes, I'm going to talk to my therapist about all this."
4794,"- Laughing therapy

- Making a schedule"
4795,I also visit a therapist regularly and asked if there was a way I'd be able to get onto an anxiety medication since I'm completely sure that I have an issue with it and she doesn't seem to think it's necessary.
4796,I am also starting therapy Thursday so I feel excited to finally start taking control!
4797,"Also, I want to know if the severity of these disorders effects your chances of getting better medically... obviously it would be Fer to do therapy with really high anxiety and unable to think striaght but can medicine get even the very severely anxious (mentally) to a manage able state to work out their issues."
4798,"therapists, my advisors)."
4799,"I see a therapist during the school year, but I also want to be more independent and work on things in between sessions."
4800,I was seeing a therapist a few months ago and she suggested I have low grade anxiety/depression that flares up during different periods of my life and that I should try medication along with yoga and exercise.
4801,"I ended up feeling much better, so I stopped going to therapy and stopped worrying about it."
4802,"I also mentioned I would only use the klonopin as needed, and as a crutch to get me to attend my therapy sessions."
4803,"I couldn't help but beat myself up with these questions: Why did he shove all those drugs down my throat without recommending any therapy, why was I given controlled substances while being addicted to meth, and why when I get sober and re-diagnosed with depression/anxiety he is no longer willing to give me the medication specifically designed for those issues."
4804,"The thing is, I started the side-business on recommendation from my therapist to make me less dependant on the life-sucking job I was holding at the time."
4805,"I know I have to see a therapist and be put on medication, but I really wanted to post this just so I have some people who understand things my friends just don't comprehend."
4806,"I don't think I've been diagnosed with anxiety, but my first therapist diagnosed with me dysthymic disorder and the next diagnosed me with depressive disorder - NOS."
4807,"In college, I was seeing a therapist and he helped sooo much but I can no longer see him since he was with my school and I already graduated."
4808,I went to a therapist but that didn't help me much.
4809,"If I feel my anxiety building, I try the ""grounding"" techniques that my therapist taught me."
4810,"I have seen therapists, psychiatrists, and tried several medications."
4811,I'm in high school and have been seeing a therapist for social anxiety for nearly a year.
4812,It has helped me overcome so much but the thought of telling my therapist about my self-image issues makes me want to throw up.
4813,I've seen several psychiatrist and several therapists and I don't ever feel like I'm progressing despite how hard I've tried to just move forward even just a little.
4814,"I feel like I can't handle the stress, the anxiety, the challenges, my feelings, I can't cope with what I have learn in therapy alone for the past year."
4815,"Probably therapy, but I don’t understand exactly how it helps, how to pick a therapist, how much it's gonna cost, and frankly I think it scares me a little bit."
4816,"I see a therapist for the first time tomorrow so maybe she can provide help, I don't know."
4817,"I finally told my fiance about it and he recommended I see a therapist, so I did."
4818,"The therapist helped but wanted to prescribe me meds, and I gave it a shot, but the feeling of the meds affecting my brain made my panic attacks even worse because I felt like I wasn't in control of my own head, the chemicals were."
4819,"I elected to try to manage it with therapy and coping techniques instead of chemicals and have been doing okay -- it's a constant struggle (I mean, constant, as in, most hours of the day) but I have a fairly normal life despite my panic disorder."
4820,"I sought out medication, therapy and practiced heaps of self help exercises."
4821,"Well, he's prescribed me meds (Cipralex), has me seeing a therapist this evening, and wants to be sure to see me again in three weeks!"
4822,I can´t get therapy due to very long waitinglists here and I want to fight it on my own.
4823,I've talked to doctors and therapists and I still keep ending up back in the same place.
4824,I've been to a psychotherapist on and off for almost a year now to try to deal with this.
4825,"And part of it is, as my former psychiatrist and therapist both have said, teaching is one of the worst jobs possible for a person such as myself with social anxiety."
4826,"I've never seen a therapist before, so I've never been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder; although I'm pretty sure it is anxiety."
4827,"So, throughout the summer I worked with a therapist and a psychiatrist and I thought I had gotten better."
4828,"I had an appointment with my therapist today, and we talked about all this."
4829,"However, nothing I've done including therapy, exercise, diet, meditation supplements, cutting out drinking, etc."
4830,I've heard a lot of success stories for exposure therapy for PTSD.
4831,I've been considering going to therapy for my social anxiety.
4832,"Yes, I go to therapy and it isn't helping."
4833,"I was going to therapy up until about a year and a half ago, and there was a short period of time (about a few weeks) when I was on medication."
4834,I searched online for cheap mental health services but all I could find was therapists and nothing about psychiatrists or anything like that.
4835,"There is also a free on-campus therapist at my school but again, they can't really give mediation."
4836,"I was told by my therapist a while ago that I suffer from social anxiety, but I've never done anything about it as it was not overly serious."
4837,"I'm seeing a therapist, but I feel like her solutions are easier said than done."
4838,"I saw a new therapist recently and she wants me to make changes to my diet and take vitamins, which I am wary of, and I also worry what she will say if I don't."
4839,"I wish i could see a therapist, but im broke as fuck!"
4840,"I saw her for a few months, and towards the end she started suggesting I put myself in uncomfortable situations as a kind of exposure therapy."
4841,"I did it au natural, no medications and therapy over twice a week for about a year."
4842,That was followed up by a physically abusive romantic relationship and my father disowning me that eventually landed me in the therapists office.
4843,I had to cover myself in thick coats and hats (in the summer) to even feel comfortable about going to the therapists office three minutes away.
4844,"Through therapy, I learned these things and believed them with all my heart."
4845,I've come to the personal conclusion that my anxiety is linked to an actual chemical imbalance and not just the horrible experiences I had as a child (which didn't help) and that I need medication to regulate my brain alongside my therapy.
4846,"My therapist agrees and she's referred me to a psychiatrist, although there is a lengthy waiting list of about 6 months...I may get in earlier."
4847,"How can I approach fixing what my therapist, my family, and I myself see as a very serious issue without creating another very serious issue (failing college and becoming apathetic about my passions)?"
4848,My therapist says that I have a beautiful mind.
4849,I see a psychotherapist every two weeks and that's going ok.
4850,However my anxiety is still incredibly bad and I'm not sure at what point of my therapy I am expected to start getting better.
4851,I am pretty sure he would be unwilling to agree to some medication for me (not even sure psychotherapists can prescribe?).
4852,Will he be likely to prescribe something for me if he knows I am seeing the therapist as well?
4853,Will he tell me to go and ask my therapist what he thinks?
4854,"I've *always* been an anxious person and I've been to several doctors and therapists, I've tried hypnotherapy as a last-resort, I've even tried changing my diet."
4855,"you may need therapy,
you may need medication, 
but eventually you will move past it and become a stronger person."
4856,"I'm in therapy, on medication, and doing everything I can on my own but it's going to cause me to lose someone I care about so much and I just don't know what to do."
4857,I started going to therapy a few weeks ago.
4858,"My therapist told me to do a ""mindfulness walk"" every day: I have to walk around the block, once, very slowly, paying attention to my body and my breathing and nothing else."
4859,Does therapy really start to work?
4860,In the summer of 2014 I was convinced to go see a therapist.
4861,"I am on Prozac and Lithium, and I have been in therapy for three years."
4862,"I went to a therapy session last week, and the last time I was seeing a therapist before I was 12."
4863,"On the other hand, I think it could just be a step in the therapy process I wasn't prepared for."
4864,"I managed to get myself to a counselor, and I am attending regular sessions with a therapist."
4865,"I went to some therapy, but I moved away to college, and that sort of disrupted my sessions."
4866,"Trying to keep this short: I have had a long history of anxiety, finally kept it under control after therapy and 10mg of lexapro."
4867,I am back in therapy and changed meds to paxil.
4868,"I have been to therapy, have tried to fight it with breathing, benzos (I didnt like the idea of them so I stopped that to try to fight it on my own), I tried to welcome it as a visitor and make room instead of trying to fight it but it has proven time after time that I can only go against it for so long before I am fully drained and give up back into my mental state of ""I cant beat this, I am weaker than it, I cannot take the feeling""."
4869,I went to a therapist last year for anxiety and for being an introvert and in a relationship but stopped due to scheduling conflicts and the therapist was hard to work with schedule wise before she stopped seeing me on the weekends.
4870,I need to know if I need a therapist or Psychiatrist.
4871,I know I can't do anything about the actual anxiety--she's seeing two therapists and taking meds--but I'd love to be able to help with this (possible) particular troubling symptom.
4872,"Anxiety doesnt terrify me like it used to thanks to therapy and such, but it is still there and will be forever."
4873,but I tell myself I'll just ask my mom the next day to take me to a therapist.
4874,"I wish that I could ask to go to a therapist without any questions asked, because that would be easier for me."
4875,"Yes, I do have social anxiety problems, and I am seeing a therapist, but I've never had my arm from halfway down the forearm to my fingers go completely numb, like it's stick in jello or something."
4876,"Also, my therapist has no idea what's going on."
4877,"At this point my mother put me in cognitive therapy, which was helpful, I got techniques to deal with my anxiety like stopping the ""circling garbage thoughts"" that anxiety creates."
4878,"I stopped going to therapy after about 6 months, and was able to control my panic attacks and daily anxiety very well."
4879,When I was 15/16 (right after I finished therapy) I got into an abusive year long relationship.
4880,I did go to a couple therapy sessions with both my parents to discuss my resentment towards them for what felt like them abandoning me when I needed them.
4881,"I can't afford therapy anymore, I don't have any health insurance at all."
4882,"I've been in therapy, and so far its helped."
4883,I just started therapy 10 days ago (been twice already) and Im feeling like I need to go every day or at least twice a day.
4884,"I have emailed my therapist and she will call me back when she can, but I just feel bad."
4885,"I decided to go to therapy, I though ""oh maybe its mental illness, once I take care of that I cant finally be happy, calm""."
4886,"SO I went to therapy, and felt a little better, i learned little things that I forget all the time, little tricks to manage my feelings, but it was short lived."
4887,I know I should try a therapy the problem is that I am afraid to call people.
4888,"I obviously tried writing emails but none of the therapists that I can actually afford replied (the replies I got were: oh derp your health insurance cant cover me, have a nice day!)."
4889,"Despite the drugs and therapy, things have gotten progressively worse, and I become more entrenched in my comfort zone."
4890,"I had therapy as a kid, for family issues."
4891,"As an adult I had some sort of therapy in college, had CBT as an adult, and then some sort of hypnosis/going back to my childhood thing."
4892,"Drugs don't work, therapy drains the bank account, and doesn't help, and I can't afford that since I haven't worked in months."
4893,"Can I talk to some sort of psychologist or therapist about this, without punishment?"
4894,I know I need therapy but I can't get it right now.
4895,"My kids are pretty well-adjusted considering everything, and I am doing all I can for them, taking them to therapy, giving them lots and lots of attention and love and validation and (hopefully) teaching them how to trust themselves and others and set boundaries to protect themselves."
4896,I am also in therapy which is good but slow.
4897,"As I continue in therapy and also various self-help exercises, I am learning that there are deep-seated issues I have with my parents that I have been struggling with my entire life but have never dealt with."
4898,"On weekends when my ex has the kids (which is about to be put to an end since he has recently expressed some pretty violent shit which has landed him in jail twice so I'm trying to restrict his access to them until he gets some therapy or SOMETHING), I mostly just sleep."
4899,I've been struggling with health anxiety for several months and my therapist has suggested the possibility of citalopram.
4900,"Because she's one of the very few friends I have, and since she was the only person I could talk to about any of this besides my therapist, I feel like I have absolutely no one now."
4901,I would like to talk to a therapist but money is really tight for me right now and can only afford the visit to the doctor.
4902,Hopefully I can talk to a therapist before making my next move.
4903,I'd like a low dose of some sort of benzo and occasional talk therapy.
4904,What if I have to go to therapy monday without taking a shower?
4905,But I am seeing a therapist soon.
4906,(and yes I've done therapy/hypnosis/meditation/herbal/reflexology/acupuncture)
4907,I cant go to therapy because it costs a lot of money where I come from.
4908,"Been diagnosed since 2012, been on Lexapro since 2013, and no current therapy plan."
4909,"My sister also has a lot of issues and goes to therapy but I would feel bad going to them about my own issues, especially  since I do not think ill be taken seriously."
4910,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
4911,I started medication and therapy at age 19.
4912,I was doing therapy.
4913,"Years and years and years of hard work, medication change ups, therapy, groups,  family support and lifestyle changes healed my brain."
4914,"I haven't been to therapy in a while, because it was great at first, but it hit a plateau."
4915,I started therapy and swore I would never take medicine.
4916,"I started my therapy up again (I had taken almost a year off), and discussed medication."
4917,Having combated extreme anxiety to attend my first appointment with the therapist I couldn't bring myself to do any of the prescribed activities and ultimately decided against attending my next appointment.
4918,I made an appointment with my therapist and asked my work for the rest of the week off.
4919,"My therapist even wrote a note to excuse me from work, but before I could even hand in my note, I was fired!"
4920,"However, I have yet to find a new shrink or therapist."
4921,"I tried vacation from work, relaxation techniques, and all the distancing exercises my last therapist taught me."
4922,"I have tried therapy, vitamins, eating healthy, and medicine."
4923,"I contacted a potential new therapist for myself last week (just kept it vague, said I'd like to speak to the therapist, etc.)"
4924,I've had this happen before with therapists and it's very demoralizing.
4925,"With the help of my therapist, I arranged with my professor something to say in class (I tend to completely panic during class so I had to think of something beforehand)."
4926,"I got referred to my local sort of councilling/therapy service, and for the past couple of months I get a phone call (usually every 3/4 weeks), from a therapist."
4927,"She has been talking me through CBT, but its the weirdest 'therapy/councilling' I have ever had."
4928,"Anyway, I tried getting accommodated but my diagnosis is out of date and my previous therapist never faxed back proof that I was in therapy."
4929,"Oh, joy, they tried to give me a referral to a therapist but honestly, that's just pissed me off and I see my Pdoc often enough to talk to him about it."
4930,"I did get a formal diagnosis for depression about 5 years ago, however, I have not been in therapy or taking medicine for some time."
4931,"I’m 21 years old and up until a couple of months ago my anxiety had gone completely undiagnosed, and I have since been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist."
4932,A couple of weeks ago my therapist suggested that I go get some testing done to see if there was anything else going on with me mentally.
4933,Nor am I in therapy anymore because I can't afford that anymore either.
4934,I think getting to see a therapist may be the best remedy for this.
4935,"I recognize that this is not something I can tackle on my own, and I'm finally ready for therapy, but the problem is that I leave for a family trip for almost 3 weeks on Tuesday, so I won't be able to see a therapist until I return."
4936,"I've tried a number of things, even self induced hypnotherapy, but every morning I wake up with anxiety."
4937,I do a bit of cognitive therapy to get myself out of it but I'm honestly traveling to a crippling place in my own brain a lot lately.
4938,"I know I kind of post a lot here, but I can't get in to see a therapist or psychologist or anything because of our medical system."
4939,My therapist suggested it and I was wondering if it worked for any of you?
4940,I'm hoping that the meds will help with therapy which has been useless in the past.
4941,They always told me a therapist would brainwash me and that it was bad to see them.
4942,I'm currently in therapy but feel like a support group would be really beneficial to me because (oddly enough) I am actually a very extroverted and open person and like listening as well as talking.
4943,tldr: Need a group therapy session.
4944,A therapist?
4945,I also started going to a therapist there this semester.
4946,It is the first time I've found a therapist that I have a good rapport with and actually challenges me.
4947,"After giving it some thought, I thinking about seeing a therapist to possibly gain some answers or solutions about myself, or to help me draw up some sort of plan to help me gain what I'm looking for out of life."
4948,"Tomorrow, I have my first therapy session ever in an attempt to overcome, or at least begin to manage, my anxiety."
4949,My therapist suggested I would be able to skip a week with him.
4950,"Even when i DO go to therapy I just lock up, i can barely get sentences out."
4951,"I really just need some help, or need to whine, or need some support group therapy."
4952,I am seeking help and going through exposure therapy.
4953,"I recently tried therapy, and it resulted in me being happy to freely discuss my issues, but did nothing in terms of help with my anxiety."
4954,Had a session with my therapist today and we talked about how I haven't been taking my meds.
4955,I did an intake for therapy today but the woman I talked with referred me to group therapy rather than one-on-one.
4956,"He says I need to demand one-on-one therapy, but I'm afraid I'm going to struggle to afford it in the midst of trying to save to move *and* also since the woman who did my intake referred me to group therapy, I'm not sure they're willing to take me on for individual therapy when other people might need my spot more."
4957,"Do not suggest therapy, it's a scam and worse than medicine."
4958,I have been to therapy and it helped a bit but then it all just came back when i stopped going.
4959,"I talked to my therapist who said I should call my doctor (just my general physician, he is who is prescribing my meds now) and see if I could get the dosage increased."
4960,"What I've been seeing (in therapy, talking with friends, and through my own observation) is that I am just not okay with myself."
4961,"I'm going to therapy and stuff, but I still just don't get what I am supposed to be dealing with."
4962,I've been in and out of therapy but never really finished a program and I'm really trying to avoid meds (my current therapist just brought this up as an option if things don't improve over the next few weeks).
4963,I see therapist for ADHD and she even suspected that I might be suffering for anxiety.
4964,"As for treatments go, I'm currently in ADHD counciling, and the therapist will help me deal with my anxiety."
4965,"Now, I haven't been formally diagnosed by any of my therapists so I try to tread lightly with this, but it's a source of great distress and impairment in my life."
4966,So this is where I tell you about my experiences with therapists.
4967,I had a total of three; the third one is my current therapist.
4968,I don't know how to express this difficulty to my therapist either.
4969,I was 19 when I started seeing my first therapist.
4970,"So I made an elaborate excuse and made my mom memorize it, because my therapist cited her."
4971,I was very distressed since I felt my last line of defense (therapy) had failed.
4972,And so I met my second therapist.
4973,Which is why my previous therapists didn't know.
4974,Third and current therapist.
4975,"But my anxiety won't let me mention it to my therapist, or ask her if she thinks I have SAD."
4976,Do you think I should see a therapist about this?
4977,Would a therapist help?
4978,I've been to therapy off and on for years regarding this and extremely low self esteem/image which I've talked about on reddit before.
4979,"While there is heaps of information out there, and on this subreddit, there is no substitution for a therapist."
4980,"Check Angie’s List for some reviews on therapists in your area, or a good ‘ol Google Search will also suffice."
4981,"I often tell my uncle I have social anxiety and that I need to see a therapist, he says I don't need him but of course he doesn't understand."
4982,I don't need months of testing and therapy that costs money and won't do anything.
4983,I've suggested some sliding scale therapists but he says he doesn't need a therapist.
4984,"I am going back to the docs tommorow, I believe the next stage is anti depressants and cognitive therapy."
4985,"I don't think I can properly illustrate the grief I'm feeling, but I'm wondering what I can tell my professors, or at least what I can tell my therapist to make this better."
4986,"Been to a couple therapists, hasn't done much."
4987,I've seen therapists.
4988,"An endless loop of medication, therapy, and anxiety that just sends back to where we were before, sometimes worse off."
4989,"I regularly meditate but I'd love to hear some helpful breathing exercises and/or any other self help tips, thank you in advance!&lt;3  

EDIT: forgot to mention, I don't take medication and I quit therapy a few months ago for other reasons."
4990,I will most likely be taking something while I go through therapy so I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on this.
4991,"This post is not to tell you why, diagnose or provide an alternative to therapy or medicines."
4992,"As a simple way to summarize the model, ACT views the core of many problems to be due to the concepts represented in the acronym*, **FEAR**:

**F**usion with your thoughts

**E**valuation of experience

**A**voidance of your experience

And the healthy alternative is to **ACT**:

**A**ccept your reactions and be present

**C**hoose a valued direction

This is the book I'm using right now:

**OK** Stop for a min

Take a deep breath."
4994,"I've tried going to therapists but I never really committed to going, and I just sort of ended up giving up on them."
4995,Can therapy and/or medication really help me out of the horrible state I am in now?
4996,I'm going to my first therapy session on Monday.
4997,I want to try just therapy alone and see where that gets me.
4998,"I'm in therapy and on medication, but when I'm stuck at school for long periods of time alone, I wig out, and am tempted to snoop on my husband's online profiles."
4999,I've recently been seeing a therapist for my anxiety; it was once so bad that i would have panic attack if i heard a toilet flush.
5000,"My therapist thinks its because i still live at home and i work with my father ( financially it makes more sense - i cannot afford college, rent, medical bills, and pay for myself)."
5001,"My anxiety has gotten a lot worse over the past few months, and I started zoloft and therapy two days ago."
5002,"Everyday, we start with group therapy and a check in of our moods."
5003,"I want to hear success stories about medication, or therapy.. Because I need a kick in the ass to get me to commit to asking for help."
5004,"I've sought help and thank goodness, I'm finally receiving help from a therapist and receiving medication (Mirtazapine, 15mg)."
5005,"I tried talking about it in therapy, but my experiment of trying to get over my fear was too much and I quit."
5006,She finally got in to a therapist who perscribed her Celexa and 10mg klonopin to take with her valium(shes taking highest dose perscribable).
5007,I'm waiting to hear back from a therapist about starting exposure therapy but in the meantime I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced this.
5008,Hopefully she'll call in a prescription for Celexa for me tomorrow (since that was what I was on last time) but obviously that takes some time to work and my next appointment with my therapist is next week.
5009,"My anxiety always felt too bad to control, councelling never worked because I would panic too hard to even listen to the therapy."
5010,"I know I should speak to a therapist or take meds, but the idea of doing either makes me worry because I feel like it would make it official that I have a real issue and not that this is just a passing feeling."
5011,"I am in therapy and have recently started inner child work, so living has become a lot harder."
5012,No therapy this week and failed my mod 1 bike test.
5013,"I tried therapy three years ago but I didn't know how to say what I was feeling, so I ended up lying."
5014,"I feel like I know exactly how you might all reply to this, you'll probably tell me to get some therapy and try to love myself, try to be more active and experience life."
5015,"She just answered them all with ""ask your therapist,"" as though she didn't want to bother answering them herself."
5016,I've been told by some therapists that I have some degree of GAD.
5017,I eventually went to therapy which helped and they put me on an SSRI.
5018,"I've spoken with my therapist, who seems to think I'm doing okay, and in all fairness, I've felt worse than this, but with all the emotional wreckage from my mother's death lying around and festering, I'm worried this is going to be a bad attack."
5019,I've been seeing a therapist for three weeks or so.
5020,"I trust my therapist, and I am starting to understand that so many issues in my life are explainable by underlying depression and anxiety."
5021,"I haven't discussed anxiety with my therapist yet, and I don't have an appointment with him until after my interview."
5022,A while back my doctor sent me to see a specialist psychiatrist who interviewed me with a psychologist and a therapist.
5023,"My mom is a licensed mental health therapist, and without saying much I'll just say that she has ignored a lot of the problems I have now and had as a child."
5024,"I know I have anxiety, everyone does, but there are a few things that have always stuck out to me but I've never wanted to talk to anyone about (because of the reasons mentioned above; my mother not being supportive and therapists never working out, my father being emotionally unavailable)."
5025,I started going to therapy.
5026,Then my therapist and I started to see a correlation between my anxiety and PMS.
5027,"I've tried therapy, and it helped a bit."
5028,"Ive never told my therapist about this, but she has mentioned something about me possibly having repressed memories, and I'm wondering if this has something to do with my fear of meds."
5029,I started talking about it with my family which lead to me going to see my doctor who recommended therapy sessions.
5030,I'm in therapy myself for depression and It's hard enough looking after myself right now.
5031,"I am going to see if she can knock me out of work for a few days, and maybe get a therapist or something."
5032,"I realised, after conversations with my therapist, that I'm not ready to handle a relationship right now."
5033,"Probably the most noticeable and customary signs and symptoms of tension that biofeedback therapy trains patients to acknowledge include:  
  
•	Cold Sticky Hands  
•	Alterations in Skin Temperature  
•	Shallow and/or Rapid Breathing  
•	Muscle Tension    
•	Elevated Heartbeat  
•	Alterations in Brainwaves  
  
**So How Exactly Does Biofeedback Affect Anxiety?"
5034,"But ever since my therapist told me this, all I've been able to focus on is my emotions and the anxiety."
5035,"I want to see a therapist, I plan to."
5036,"I haven't seen a therapist in a little over a year, simply because I haven't been able to find one I click with in this area."
5037,That and the fact that with a new therapist I'd have to re-tell my life story and dredge up terrible memories which is not something I'm actively seeking to do.
5038,Intellectually I know a therapist is the best bet....
5039,"I was meant to have my fist official therapy session today, but it was canceled thanks to the hurricane."
5040,"I'm really looking forward to just talking to someone :) 


If there is anything stopping you from getting the help you need whether it be going to a mental health center in your city like me, going to a support group, or going to therapy just put aside any worries about it and just schedule an appointment."
5041,"Hi, I'm female, 21, and I have a therapist and a psychiatrist to handle my panic attacks, general anxiety, and mild depression."
5042,"Well, I decided to see a new therapist who is great and he put me on Remeron (Mirtazapine)."
5043,I am also going to be taking classes through my health care provider and meeting with a therapist again.
5044,"I also have done therapy for a long time, and mediation, yoga, massage, basically every common natural way of dealing with anxiety."
5045,"I don't want to take strong medication, but I have not even started therapy or much of anything else."
5046,"EDIT: 5 hour plane ride btw

I actually saw a therapist/psychiatrist many years back for anxiety but that fixed itself."
5047,I don't either but my therapist sure did.
5048,"Except, he won't accept my years of therapy as valid apparently."
5049,"Right now im only 19 and really dont know how to proceed with my life and how to help myself, im not very privileged when it comes to money so therapy and doctor visits its a bit limited."
5050,Was I just experiencing the euphoric experience that many talk about or is that ultra calm and relaxed feeling what is to be expected even long into therapy?
5051,"What are your recipes and how do you use it (light bulb, diffuser, on your wrists, etc)

I'm planning to get ""The Complete Book of Essential Oils and Aromatherapy""

Any info is helpful."
5052,"Currently, I have a few things I'm trying: 1) Pursuing different meds, 2) continuing counseling with my counselor, 3) Seeing a general physician (haven't had a checkup in years), 4) Seeking group therapy, 5) Maybe exercising (which has always been hard for me), 6) trying to do CBT and recognizing and fighting automatic thoughts."
5053,"I saw my therapist today and I didn't even have the guts to show her the bloody, scabby, peeling mess that is my arm."
5054,I am already seeing a therapist.
5055,I started going to therapy and increased my Cipralex to 15mg for a while.
5056,I was in and out of therapy when I was younger and it was a total waste of time.
5057,"I've had people who I confided in (one therapist and a close, close friend) both brush off the idea, but I was shamed for a lot as a kid (being overweight, not being very social, being disrespectful) by my parents."
5058,"[Warning, some feminine-related issues]My mom, who I believe has some problems herself due to being abused as a kid herself (not blaming her, again) and not seeking help or therapy for that, had some what-I-consider strange biases with me and my friends."
5059,I saw a therapist for a couple sessions but stopped  because of a financial confusion.
5060,"20 mg in the am, 0.5 mg generic Xanax XR in the pm (have been taking the Xanax since February)

Day 1 = four hour dizzy spell, otherwise in great spirits that evening...made it to therapist and dentist appointments...
Day 2 = same deal...went to visit my aunt, felt a little bad b/c of her pain spell she was having...
Day 3 = realized I took the am pill on an empty stomach, longer sleepy/dizzy spells, was able to do some laundry, be a little functional...
Day 4 (today)...got up, made small breakfast, slept a little longer, dizzies started earlier and are still going...made it outside to play with neighbor's cat for a little while, otherwise in the bed most of the day with the tv on for noise...been down and anxious...but I did make it downstairs to play a little piano (haven't touched the thing in over a week)..."
5061,"I am currently seeing a therapist but it isn't doing anything, its just like seeing a doctor, its like she has only done a one week long course on helping people with anxiety and panic."
5062,I've been on a vacation with family and for the most part I have been able to manage my anxiety with Ativan and coping techniques I learned in therapy.
5063,Like if I can explain to my therapist that I have 100% of the symptoms then maybe I do have it and it's not just my brain fucking with me?
5064,I don't really feel like seeing a therapist because quite frankly I'm in university and work a lot and I don't really have the time or the finances to cover it.
5065,"""Oh, just go to therapy!"""
5066,I'm in therapy.
5067,I have had an evaluation with a therapist and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety.
5068,"My therapist wanted to put me on antidepressants, and wanted me to give up pot I refused and stopped going to her almost immediately."
5069,"I've been going to therapy and counseling since the 4th grade, I think."
5070,My doctor and my therapist and pretty much every blog/article/self-help guide has told me that exercising helps with anxiety.
5071,"My boyfriend (we live together for about 4 years), has been dealing with depression/add since forever, but always was a cycle, until now, it's been like 4 months since he left his job (not quitting, he just didn't went to work anymore) and he's been in therapy with psychiatrist the same amount of time."
5072,"When I was in high school, my anxiety primarily centered around doing things in public and a fear of looking like I didn't know what I was doing, so for a long time my therapist and I thought it was social anxiety disorder."
5073,"Now I'm realizing that the obsessive thoughts and general feeling like I'm one step away from my entire world falling apart is more symptomatic of generalized anxiety disorder, which was thought to be the case during some cognitive behavioral therapy I did for a traumatic brain injury about a year ago."
5074,I've been seeking treatment for anxiety and depression over the past 2 months - going to a therapist weekly and seeing a psychatrist in combination.
5075,I'm seeing a therapist right now.
5076,"Today I went into a shop and brought some objects as part of one of steps my therapist asked me to do and whilst I was driving on the way home I was wondering to myself if I trick myself into being anxious around these situations just to avoid responsibility, I've been at home for just over a year now and I've realised that my ""social anxiety"" is what stops people asking why I haven't got a job, now I'm not a fan of responsibility but apart of me thinks I'm just doing this to myself and it scares me."
5077,"* I've sought therapy about 3 times over the last 3 years, but end up ""fleeing"" at various points."
5078,"I have GAD but I am not on any medication for it, just therapy."
5079,"I have also looked into therapy, but its too expensive for me..."
5080,"I wish I could get through the two weeks like everyone else can, but I think I'm in trouble.. My therapist wants me to let her in so she can help me and is worried about me, but I'm too embarrassed to admit something is wrong."
5081,"I've shared bits and pieces with a couple friends, my mom, my therapist, but ive never spit them all out at once."
5082,Please don't just tell me I need medication or to see a therapist.
5083,"I have panic disorder and was seeing a wonderful, supportive therapist once a week."
5084,"So I miss my therapy sessions, and I feel like I'm going stir crazy."
5085,"I have anxiety and depression and have been going through a rough time lately, so I decided to try to get therapy."
5086,I had some therapy in the past but I live in a different country now.
5087,"The processes are a bit different this time because I have insurance now, so I'm trying to get an approved provider, which would be great because my last therapist was $150/hr out of pocket and this time with my insurance it will only cost a $15 copay."
5088,"But holy crap, it's hard to get therapy with all the telephone tag I'm having to do."
5089,"In my previous therapy I did learn some coping strategies, like writing a script before making a phone call, but it's still hard for me."
5090,I waited two days to get a call from them and they said they'd send me an email with numbers for therapists in my area.
5091,"I tried to do some online research about the therapists on the list to see if any of them sounded like a good match for me, but there was really no info."
5092,"One of the therapists had a website with a contact form so I tried sending her an email, but I didn't get a reply."
5093,Finally they left a message for me today and said there was a therapist with some openings next Monday and I should call her.
5094,"I just want help, but trying to get therapy feels like running the gauntlet."
5095,"Last time it was way easier; I made one phone call and got to see a therapist who was within walking distance of my house (I can't drive, so that was great for me)."
5096,"I also discussed how I don't have insurance and how I'd love to do some actual therapy, but I can't afford it."
5097,"I started going to therapy 3 months ago when I felt like I couldn't control anything around me - my grades were slipping, I wasn't sleeping well, I was too afraid of what my friends will think of me so I didn't go to class."
5098,"I saw a therapist last summer, and it helped but now it is coming back to me since I am most likely moving half way across the country for a job."
5099,The thing that helped the most with my therapist was just talking to someone about it.
5100,"My therapist also said he thinks I think the worst in situations because I don't think I deserve some things, which is true."
5101,In a few days I'll be seeing my therapist again.
5102,So how does one like me build rapport and trust between the therapist?
5103,How did you learn to trust your therapist?
5104,It took a lot of therapy and lifestyle changes to realize that while maybe I was more prone to anxiety than others my thoughts and beliefs were the real problem.
5105,"I underwent cognitive behavioral therapy for a few months and found that it helped me overcome my tendency to avoid social situations, but the anxiety is still there and makes life very unenjoyable."
5106,"I talk to a therapist which helps relieve some of the anxiety, but only temporarily."
5107,In the mean time I've been visiting a therapist for a few years that I wasn't really all that satisfied with.
5108,"Finally I gave in to her suggestions that I 1) get on medication, which is now a low dose of Lexapro, 2) continue seeing a therapist, and 3) attend a mindfulness meditation group."
5109,"I'm now with a new therapist as the old one retired from her practice, and FYI the new guy I like a lot, but still, as before, I just don't feel like anyone is actually HELPING me."
5110,I see a therapist from time to time and have been on and off a few medicines over the past decade.
5111,"I've tried telling my parents and therapist but they think I'm lazy, but I'm not."
5112,I have the meds I need and am going to be receiving therapy FINALLY with the right healthcare.
5113,"[link](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/287/backed-into-a-corner?act=3)

Specifically, whenever a therapist asks about suicide."
5114,"I have signed up for therapy, but I still have to wait for my first appointment, and I'd like to hear if anyone here might have dealt with their anxiety in any creative manner and are willing to share."
5115,I've been having mini panic attacks over seeing a therapist and talking about everything that's going wrong mentally/psychologically.
5116,"I've been to therapy before years ago and my therapist basically told me I was a lost cause, I'll always be depressed/anxious and that coming to see her was wasting both our time."
5117,It really ruined my idea of therapy but I really need to start seeing someone again that can hopefully help...
5118,I was also seeing a Psychologist and was prescribed antidepressants and Cognitive Behavioral therapy both of which did nothing for me and in fact made me believe i was sicker than i already was.
5119,"I scheduled a therapy appointment next Thursday and of course, since I suffer from social anxiety, I am completely petrified."
5120,I don't like to take medicine and I'm hoping the therapist doesn't think I need it.
5121,"There's no identifiable 'cause' (work/relationship) even as I explore with my therapist, just palpitations and dread most of the day, fear that my blood pressure is high or that I'm going to have a 'cardiac incident'."
5122,I saw therapists and had panic attacks and went to hospitals and I still didn't tell anyone anything that was ever on my mind.
5123,"I’m not a certified therapist or doctor, but I’ve been consulting a few people who suffers from Depression &amp; anxiety to find out the suitable and fastest course to them as once one of the D &amp; A victims."
5124,"A week or two back I asked my parents if I could go back to therapy (having been in it years ago- It isn't really relevant to this, it wasn't about anxiety)."
5125,"Now I'm going to therapy again, and I'm doing somewhat better, and I'm definitely happy I'm in it- but the next two weeks are all midterms and doing tests before the midterms, so I have only been getting worse."
5126,"I know that asking me for details on why I, say, need therapy is normal and to be expected."
5127,"Obviously I don't quite know what my problem here is, I suspect having a therapist to sort things out with would be extremely helpful :) ."
5128,And it's not just about life-changing things like getting therapy; I'm also incredibly secretive about everything I do or want to do.
5129,"I just have to use my filter of experience to ignore the bad while internalizing the good, and so far it has helped me far more than years of therapy."
5130,"I find out next Wednesday if I'll be allowed back to work or not 

In the meantime, honestly, my injury is no better despite physiotherapy 

I found out just now that my manager, my inspiration, my rock, the most approachable pesos, the friendliest authoritative figure, the reason I feel so comfortable doing what I'm doing - is leaving."
5131,"I don't want to see a therapist due to the prices being so expensive, and am afraid of being placed on medication that may just make the problem worse."
5132,I was an idiot for a long time and never told my therapists or psychologists the full truth because I was afraid of them judging me.
5133,"Which leads me to believe that the level of anxiety I had before was enough for me to warrant seeing a therapist and getting medication, but *this....* this was *real* anxiety, and panic."
5134,"I'm going to therapy, but it's not making me feel better as fast as I wished."
5135,Would it help if I spoke to a therapist to help him through it?
5136,"I still need to schedule an appointment with the therapist, but I am scared, still."
5137,"Over the last two years I have tried therapy, yoga, exercise, and finally medication, but this $4 book I bought used on Amazon has been the most helpful by far."
5138,"There's therapy, books, medication, meditation, exercise...tons of ways to at least start treating your anxiety and eventually curing it."
5139,Recently I told a white lie about having a doctors appointment when I was really going to a therapy session- which is another thing I'm also unsure about sharing with him.
5140,I also see a therapist on a weekly basis.
5141,"I'm off to my therapist appointment, and i won't see her until later tonight."
5142,I've been seeing a therapist for three weeks or so.
5143,"I trust my therapist, and I am starting to understand that so many issues in my life are explainable by underlying depression and anxiety."
5144,"I haven't discussed anxiety with my therapist, and I don't have an appointment with him until after my interview."
5145,"My therapist says she doesn't see me doing no harm, but sometimes I think people underestimate me."
5146,"I have loosely been diagnosed by a therapist as having a ""fun"" mix of depression and anxiety."
5147,My therapist is having me keep track of my moods using a mood diary.
5148,"This has been so horrible, and I at least want to maintain while I wait for medication and more therapy :/

EDIT: I have seen a psychologist, but I'm waiting for a psychiatry consult."
5149,"I used to talk to a therapist, and after a while my anxiety went away."
5150,"I would maybe talk to a therapist, but I don't know if I can afford that kind of thing."
5151,I'm starting to feel that maybe I could get by with just therapy.
5152,I get to see a social worker weekly and I started to go to group therapy.
5153,I just had another intake after a long period of not seeing a therapist and am waiting for the first appointment and trying to figure out what is wrong with myself.
5154,"I started seeing a doctor through school, horray for free therapy!"
5155,We'll help you find community support if longterm therapy is needed.)
5156,"I've started going to therapy again, but it's taking so long week to week."
5157,He's already going to get occupational therapy and I work with him almost every night in work books to help him along.
5158,I see a therapist regularly.
5159,"I've been seeing one, I was assigned to him and didn't even realize until recently he wasn't a doctor but a therapist."
5160,"A doctor, therapist?"
5161,What type of therapist?
5162,"For a while I had this weird paranoia as well as PTSD like symptoms but I seem to be fine now that my thoughts are more controlled, I'm seeing a therapist and meditating."
5163,Did talk therapy and tried several SSRIs with varying success.
5164,"Around last year I got to a really low oint because I hadn't been on anything for about 12 months, and it was a final push to get help because I was too anxious to do anything, school work, cleaning, hanging out with friends/family was difficult, and I finally went to therapy and got on meds."
5165,"People in my life that I talk to about this - teachers, family members, friends, my therapist - mostly just wish me luck or tell me to do little things at a time, but I can't even get to the little things."
5166,EDIT: I am already seeing a therapist and it really hasn't been helping much at all.
5167,My therapist gave me this site to go on.
5168,Right now I've finished my 5 weeks and I'm on the waiting list for more intense therapy but whilst I'm waiting I've been browsing this site and it is pretty helpful in dealing with anxiety and depression.
5169,So my therapist tells me I need to do more things for me and have more fun..I'm a 36/m married with two kids ages 5 and 10 both girls.
5170,"People online and therapists have nice things to say sometimes, but what I really need is someone who can actually help me GET A JOB!"
5171,my anxiety is getting worse and worse and therapy doesn't feel like it's helping and all I want is normalcy I don't want to have panic attacks three times a week I don't want to feel alone I don't want to push anybody away but I only want him.
5172,I'm seeing a therapist twice a month.
5173,"A week ago I went back to see my doctor, got referred to therapy (I'm now on a waiting list) and began to feel better after asking for more help."
5174,So should I tell my therapist about this incident?
5175,"I even go to a therapist, but sadly it doesn't really help much, but that's kind of my fault."
5176,Now why does this effect my therapy?
5177,"I guess I came here to talk about it, and to get some reassurance that with help from a doctor, a therapist, and maybe even medicine, we can get this thing under some degree of control and keep having our wonderful relationship."
5178,"I have a therapist, I take meds."
5179,I got out of that hellhole yesterday but tomorrow I am being forced in to group therapy.
5180,"I talk to people just fine, and have been to several group therapys before, which aren't in the least therapeutic, just frustrating because nobody actually takes shit seriously as a teenager."
5181,Now I am being out in a place where I would rather have my legs runover by a team roller than go to therapy.
5182,"What can I donor, my anxie is back, no medications work, and therapy has been a bust for me,even when I trytogetsmething out of it."
5183,I have worked with my therapist but I wanted to know some of your ideas!
5184,Is it normal to 'grow out' of needing a therapist?
5185,She has been seeing a therapist on and off for about five years.
5186,"I very much am not comfortable with the idea of seeing a therapist about this though, as I have friends I can talk to who also have this problem - they recommend I give meds a go as it has helped them."
5187,Am I able to get a prescription without having to take therapy sessions?
5188,I recently started therapy and I had my second session today.
5189,During the session last week the therapist mostly talked about the method he wants to use (CBT) and how that works.
5190,"Then the therapist wanted to know what chaos is and how I define it, but I couldn't explain it."
5191,It was a good therapy session (really) but I can't help but feeling low anyway.
5192,EDIT: I find it very difficult to express my thoughts which is one of the reasons I'm so exhausted after this therapy session.
5193,"I dont have health insurence, therapy is out of the question for now."
5194,Can you get better without therapists and drugs?
5195,"I don't know what to do or who to turn to, and I feel like maybe going back to therapy like I used to in the past would help, but seeing as I don't live in one set place and hop from person to person to stay with, trying to find a therapist to regularly go to is impossible."
5196,"My parents and my therapist convinced me that I had to lower my expectations if I wanted to complete the semester, so for the past month I have been focusing on getting enough sleep, going on bike rides, and working just hard enough to complete my projects without overburdening myself."
5197,"I am currently seeing a therapist about my anxiety, but I guess I was also just looking for some advice for people who may experience something similar or have good techniques for overcoming intrusive thoughts."
5198,"I've tried to talk him into seeing a doctor, but the mental health services in our area are shockingly bad and oversubscribed (a wait of 6 months+ for a therapist) and we can't afford to go private."
5199,As I have little to no knowledge with anxiety – other than personal experiences – all I could advise him to do was to seek a therapist.
5200,"I know I should see a therapist/psychiatrist to get help with my mental health issues but I just really don't have the time for that right now -_-

And oppinions, suggestions, experiences are welcome (:"
5201,"With the help of my girlfriend and this sub, I've finally talked to my physician and I will be starting therapy tomorrow."
5202,I can easily say please go see a therapist but she states she's extremely busy with summer school and work.
5203,"I have a therapist I see once a month; I called to get a one off appointment to discuss all this, but she is on vacation."
5204,"I never went to a therapist or anything like that, but flash forward to now for the sake of time haha."
5205,"I have been to therapist before, but they always just place blame on my parents divorce that occured 8 years ago."
5206,This is something I learned in therapy that I find immensely helpful.
5207,"Anxiety has literally ruined my confidence and every day life, so let's see if therapy works."
5208,Has anyone else got experience with therapy.
5209,"She feels her therapist doesn't understand, and she doesn't trust her advice all that much."
5210,"I hear you guys mentioning therapy, I wanted to know if it works, and how well it works."
5211,I'm finally seeing a therapist and hopefully a psychologist this month - I've gone through lots of awful things with family lately.
5212,I think I actually need therapy and my mom is against it.
5213,"I want to go to the therapist, I feel like I have no one to share my madness with."
5214,"I'm not trying to plug anything, but this one stood out as appealing: 

http://www.online-therapy.com

It's difficult to find reviews on these sorts of things."
5215,I know I'm not going to manage a trip out to the therapist's office at any regular interval if I have to deal with traffic and long waits around people smacking their lips or mouth agape.
5216,I'd love to find an online solution to help me start a well founded cognitive behavioral therapy.
5217,Has anyone had a pleasant and productive experience with any online therapy providers?
5218,I've sent to therapy and even take riva clonazepam to put me back in order when I need it.
5219,"I've been in therapy for years, but nothing seems to be helping."
5220,I went to a therapist for a while last year.
5221,"I am taking a leave from work to focus on figuring out my medication, therapy, and the direction I need to go after this."
5222,"I developed anxiety attacks about two years ago after an isolated incident, then created a plan on how to address and eliminate it that included mindfulness meditation, some therapy (not super helpful), confronting triggers in controlled doses, and a very low dose of anti-anxiety meds that worked WONDERS."
5223,"**tl;dr: My friend has mostly irrational reasons to not try medication therapy for her debilitating anxiety attacks, and I don't know how to deal with it other than just let her keep suffering."
5224,"I have no health insurance and while I would like to see a therapist, I don't know that that is possible."
5225,"Please all I need is a little help can someone who had serious anxiety that they could not like Leave their room point me in a direction, of what type of therapy I should go to or just fucking point me in some direction so I get our of my fucking room already it's been over a month and I haven't left..."
5226,I'm about to start CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) for anxiety.
5227,Throughout this whole time I've been seeing a therapist and saw a psychiatrist who prescribed me Ativan.
5228,I've done some therapy and it's has help slightly but I don't feel like I'm ever going to make any serious headway.
5229,Today my therapist told me I look like I'm doing a lot better.
5230,"I have seen therapists since I was little, and I've been hospitalized multiple times since puberty, although it was mostly due to my parents losing their patience with my panic attacks and refusal to go to school."
5231,"As I grew older I became more frustrated and disillusioned with pandering therapists and the ever-changing cocktail of meds I was prescribed, which never seemed to do me any good."
5232,I haven't had proper sleep in days because of this and currently my therapy isnt doing the trick.
5233,"Thank you again,

irtherapist"
5234,"I've been reading a lot of self-help books in the meantime (I'm waiting to get in to a therapist nearby, but they're so backlogged it's taking awhile)."
5235,"I was told to make an appointment with the behavioral therapist, and I explained the exact same scenario to her."
5236,"She suggested exercise and meeting with behavioral therapist, first available appointment 2 months from now."
5237,He's started seeing a therapist recently though and I'm hoping that that helps him be happier.
5238,C and D are trying to treat their depression with therapy alone.
5239,I just want all of them to stop treating me like their second therapist and suicide watchman before I start to outright hate them.
5240,What if therapy doesn't work?
5241,"So I've been considering going back to a therapist to help get over my anxiety so I can get a job sometime in the spring of next year, but I'm not sure if I can get over my anxiety in ~15 weeks."
5242,Does anyone here see a therapist twice a week?
5243,"I would like twice a week sessions so that I can see progress quicker, but I'm just wondering if therapists have a reason against that for whatever it may be."
5244,My therapist said it seems like I've come down with PTSD.
5245,Luckily medication and therapy has helped with a lot of that.. except now I carry scissors and nail clippers everywhere.
5246,"I really started thinking about this idea when I was explaining to my therapist how a specific scenario like, ""now we're going to go around the room and talk a little bit about ourselves"", would give me a panic attack."
5247,"I need a therapist, or more likely, a shrink."
5248,"I don't have time to see a therapist right now because of finals, so is there anything else I could do?"
5249,"Today, as per my therapist's advice, I went to have my makeup done at a department store."
5250,"May not seem like much, but it involved some pretty creative/good exposure therapy:

1) I had a complete stranger doing my makeup and seeing every flaw on my face, up close."
5251,"originally I thought I had a good handle on my anxiety and then I got too high (weed) and it made my anxiety worse and I have been talking about it  because it makes my stomach almost too sensitive to eat and yeah I just want to have a positive look on life and I know I am gonna get better because my step-dad said that it just happens at my age, and I just gotta accept that I am gonna get better and ya know I am also gonna to start seeing a therapist soon I just felt like sharing with r/anxiety thank ya'll for whoever read all this!"
5252,I just haven't had the money or insurance to see a therapist or a doctor or whatever.
5253,She has been doing the right thing to meet with a therapist once a week.
5254,I sought out some therapy and was medicated until I learned to control my severe panic attacks without the meds.
5255,"Like I mentioned earlier, I am currently not medicated and not engaged in counseling/therapy."
5256,I truly cannot say enough good things about the Andrew Johnson hypnotherapy apps on the iPhone - particularly the ['Dont Panic'](http://www.withandrewjohnson.com/recording/dont-panic/) and 'Relax'.
5257,I was in therapy since age 7 and recently quit.
5258,"I've been doing really well lately because I have been in consistent therapy for a year now, and I'm finally on meds that actually make a difference."
5259,"My therapist suggested that I register with the Office of Disability so that I can ask for a special provision like giving my presentation to the professor only in her office, but I hate the thought of being given ""special treatment""."
5260,I was in therapy for like 10 years of my life.
5261,I am hoping there is some kind of herb/meditation/therapy that can help me with this anxiety in lieu of a pill or a pint.
5262,I've been seeing my therapist for about a month and a half.
5263,"-----------------------------------
**Short version**

My therapist didn't allow enough time between clients to discuss monetary issues."
5264,"BTW, I saw my therapist this morning and didn't think to tell her."
5265,"I do see a therapist (I'm seeing her tomorrow she knows about all this stuff) and go for walks to calm down and things of that nature, but sometimes it's just good to write it out for others to see that aren't already in the situation, ya know?"
5266,Thanks for everyone that supports people on this subbreddit as well it really is a great therapy.
5267,No amount of therapy works.
5268,"EDIT: I forgot to mention that I've recently moved out, I'm seeing a psychotherapist, arranging relationship counselling and will be talking to a solicitor soon too."
5269,"I've just started seeing a therapist who does hypno, EMDR, and other related types of therapy."
5270,I've been in therapy the past 2 and a half years and I've worked really hard to manage my anxiety/depression.
5271,"It's an ongoing struggle of course, but I truly believe I wouldn't have been able to get through this week of a phone interview and a 1:1 interview without the help of my therapist."
5272,"Time, therapy and meds have made me learn how to deal with the stress so it doesn't generally boil over into anxiety."
5273,I've decided I should probably see a therapist again.
5274,I was sent to meet with a therapist but I couldn't find her office so I began to shake and cry.
5275,"So I started seeing a therapist, but all she could help me with where the technique's that I already know."
5276,"I know therapy is out there, and if I get this job I interviewed for on Friday (fingers crossed!)"
5277,"I'm off meds and without psychotherapy for over a year, I have to wait about a year to test my ears or pay money (hoooray our ""free"" healthcare!)"
5278,"I have spoken to my therapists about it, they never have advice."
5279,"The best my last therapist gave was ""look, I'm on this computer and I shouldn't be!"
5280,"Currently, I am awaiting my medicare to go through, so I cannot see a therapist quite yet."
5281,"I usually can trust anyone my therapist sends me to because he only refers me to people he knows personally, but I'm having a hard time since he referred me to a psychiatrist."
5282,I'm currently in therapy once a week.
5283,I just stopped EMDR a few weeks ago because the therapist said that my fears are entirely rational and it's unethical and probably impossible to get rid of them.
5284,"This Friday, I have a psychiatrist appointment with someone my therapist referred me to."
5285,"Will hurt me (and my therapist won't be able to help because people believe psychiatrists over therapists, or that my therapist isn't actually as trustworthy as he's made himself out to be which has happened to me before)
3."
5286,"I'm seeing my therapist right after I get done with the doctor, but I just don't know how I'll make it until then."
5287,"I try everything; meditation, therapy, exercise, etc, but it all seems to be a temporary stop-gap."
5288,"quick backstory: I've been sick for a while now because of a depression with anxiety (and going to very helpful therapy), which means that I worked less and started to build up my hours slowly."
5289,instead of paying money for therapy.
5290,I was told that I was in the “refractory group” and that the only thing that would work for me is “gene therapy”.
5291,"As far as psychotherapy goes, I have tried a few things."
5292,"Hi guys,

24-female from Canada here 

The past year has been emotionally grueling to say the least, unfortunately despite having many friends , Ive become very secluded and alone ...I just need someone to talk to before the anxiety and depression take over...I do see a therapist...."
5293,"But I can only afford to see her every 3 weeks ( and Im not sure I will afford it coming up because I insurance only covered up until 1000$ worth of therapy)  

Basically Im sort of in a terrible place and need help ....


 having someone to talk to would be very nice."
5294,Recently i realized that i had to start therapy and my mom who is really supportive helped me.
5295,Then my therapist was sick so we cancelled and it's been a while.
5296,"After almost a month of not seeing my therapist, these past few days have been some of the worst in my life."
5297,"Fast forward way too many doctor appointments, an ER visit and two therapist (Masters level, not a psychologist or psychiatrist if I understand that correctly) later here I am."
5298,3) For those of you who went the therapy route how long did it take you to find one you clicked with?
5299,I'm seeing a therapist after my school finally pestered my mom into getting me one because I had a few break downs at school.
5300,My boyfriend is tired of being my therapist and putting up with my severe mood swings that have been consistent for a year and a half.
5301,I kind of wish I could get a therapy dog but the apartment I live in allows no pets and I wouldn't qualify for one anyway.
5302,I only get six therapy sessions paid for by my insurance and it didn't really help anyway...
5303,I saw a therapist and they were really helpful.
5304,* My anxiety didn't get better so I sought out a therapist.
5305,I didn't like this therapist and found them unhelpful (especially compared to the first) so I discontinued therapy and opted to deal with the anxiety on my own.
5306,I have been in therapy for two years but he is psycho-dynamic therapist so progress is slow.
5307,I need to find a therapist for anxiety/panic attacks.
5308,The thought of finding a therapist sends me into a panic attack.
5309,"Your task is to start doing these exposures (often times as role-plays in the safety of your therapist's office) until you retrain your brain to realize that you aren't in danger (it's more complicated than that, but I'm sure you're already sick of reading)."
5310,"I've been to multiple cognitive therapy sessions over the past year and they have helped, but for some reason these past two weeks have been a constant struggle."
5311,"Things got much, much better after cognitive therapy, so I stopped going for about 6 months."
5312,I am seeing a therapist for depression.
5313,But I have been going to therapy because I have a myriad of issues from my past to deal with.
5314,"This is my first time in therapy, it's been a few months now."
5315,"I like my therapist, she's really patient and kind."
5316,"To keep this short, I have been working with a great new therapist (whom I had to be forced to go to) and she has greatly helped me understand just what I needed to do to help myself."
5317,I made great strides in therapy today and like to share my accomplishments with my family.
5318,"since you are paying every week for therapy?"""
5319,I don't really know what to do to get a therapy session.
5320,"Any feedback appreciated, especially where I can try a therapy session without insurance, if its even possible."
5321,I've thought about counseling but I'm just so nervous of that the therapist will think of me.
5322,"I was going to therapy but had to quit since I was about to leave the country and one of my friends had the brilliant idea of giving me some Xanax, and it worked."
5323,"It was miserable, and I lost weight (which is REALLY not okay for me, I'm already a stick), and my parents weren't letting me speak to my therapist over the phone more than once a month because over the phone appointments are too expensive."
5324,"Anyway, while I've been working with a new therapist once a week since about March now, and while I'm getting better, I still can't deal with going out to eat at restaurants."
5325,I've been seeing a therapist for a while but haven't really moved forward in dealing with anxiety when it happens.
5326,I've seen cognitive-behavioral therapy come up a lot on this sub and other contexts.
5327,Should I try to find a different therapist?
5328,"I have a therapist but I don't get to see them enough, once a month but usually something on my end or their's gets in the way of my appointment and I have to wait another month."
5329,"These small things have always bothered me, they're not new anxiety triggers or anything, but they're so small I wouldn't have even thought to bring them up to anyone, including my therapist, until this morning."
5330,"I'm on medication (150mg Wellbutrin &amp; 50mg Zoloft) and have a therapist, and while I'm definitely on the right track to getting better, I still have my issues."
5331,"Im seeing a therapist, and my family dr. has given me an antidepressant (which has been working for the most part)."
5332,"He said he wasnt going to give me anything more when he took me off the busprone, and i should try relaxation techniques and continued therapy."
5333,"The therapy does work more, and I am planning on continuing it for as long as it helps."
5334,"Both my dr and therapist agreed, and confirmed my diagnoses."
5335,I can't afford a therapist.
5336,"My therapist keeps encouraging me to be social and try to be open to new experiences, but it never ends well."
5337,"He did refer me to a physical therapy clinic, where I racked up $1,000 worth of bills for six sessions that did nothing."
5338,"I got the orthopedist's assistant to issue me a new prescription for physical therapy, (and it was only at this point that anyone mentioned that the place they'd referred me to was a specialty clinic and therefore more expensive than most) but I have no idea how to find a physical therapist that I can afford."
5339,This is basically the same problem I am having with finding a mental therapist.
5340,"I tried to request that I be allowed to see one of their actual therapists, but they are making me see her at least one last time in spite of the fact that I explained that it would be a very stressful experience for me to have to explain to a counselor why I do not want to see them anymore, and also that I would rather not use up another one of my limited number of sessions with her."
5341,"To add to this, I am transgender, so I also need to find doctors/therapists who will treat me like a human being and not chalk my problems up to that, because I have been on hormone replacement therapy for three years now and so it is not negatively affecting my mental state any longer."
5342,See if maybe he has a suggestion for a physical therapist?
5343,"- Try to call a few physical therapy places, as unpleasant and confusing as it is."
5344,"I am doing well in school, seeing a therapist weekly."
5345,"I've been dealing pretty well with my anxiety over the last few months with the help of therapy, group therapy, and low dose Buspar, as well as things like exercise, meditation and journaling."
5346,So I got a referral for a psychiatrist from my therapist after my pcp refused to prescribe ativan or clonazepam which was recommended to me during a hospitalization.
5347,I went outside yesterday for the first time in months to go to therapy and it was really difficult.
5348,"I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, or has any advice for solutions to overcome my fear, get back to eating normally again, what to expect when I go to the doctor/therapist, suggestions for how tell my Mom/ instructor/ others."
5349,He also gave me a self referral for therapy but I'm so hesitant about it.
5350,I've never seen a therapist before and ironically it's causing me more anxiety thinking about the prospect of it.
5351,"I'd love to know others experiences with therapy, particularly with the UK NHS or anyone who can offer words of wisdom or support."
5352,"""There has to be a more... elegant solution than seeing a therapist."""
5353,"But there really is no time for therapy or money for medication, nothing."
5354,I was put on some meds and have started a bit of therapy but have yet to get far.
5355,I've been in therapy since I was a child.
5356,"I've seen several therapists, psychiatrists, and counselors."
5357,My therapist was very proud of me for holding my boundaries and not letting them push my buttons.
5358,"i've gone to a doctor and my heart is fine, my therapist said it's probably my anxiety."
5359,I just started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist and they gave me Xanax.
5360,Any suggestions for other therapies would be appreciated.
5361,"I've tried ""exposure therapy"" on my own but it wont get better."
5362,do they often prescribe medication right away or therapy?
5363,I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow but I would like to hear other people's ideas on how to deal with anxiety.
5364,"I leave to go visit my therapist and he continues to email me, hassling me for an explanation for my behavior."
5365,"Its not a substitute for actual therapy but, after having gone to real therapy, there are many similarities and the convenience of having it in your pocket makes it more accesible."
5366,I can't go to a therapist.
5367,I have been in therapy and have an appointment to see a psychiatrist on the 30th.
5368,"I tried free group therapy at a church, but I had a panic attack while I was there and had to leave and stop going out of fear of another one."
5369,"I've dealt with anxiety most of my young/adult life....saw a therapist earlier this year and it was extraordinarily helpful, gave me the tools I felt warded away periods of crippling depressing...but these tactics are doing nothing to help me right now."
5370,"I'm currently in therapy, but it all seems so overwhelming sometimes."
5371,TLDR; don't know if my anxiety is enough to need therapy/medicine.
5372,My therapist suggested I join a activity group.
5373,"I'm going to make an appointment at the therapist tomorrow, because it's getting so tiresome to live in constant stress."
5374,Do I need therapy?
5375,I am now in therapy and apparently have a problem with anger management.
5376,"Through therapy I've been able to gather that I get the majority of my attacks when I am 'in trouble' (like my boss says ""I need to see you"" And it doesn't even need to be bad."
5377,"and after several months of better sleep, therapy, no googling and mentally taking things one thing at a time, I finally feel in control again."
5378,I'm not sure I need therapy as I can do social things outside of swing like work mates and people not from the scene but I just don't know...
5379,I've been reading a lot of books on spirituality and psychology as well as talking to a therapist to try and kill my anxiety.
5380,I'm looking for information about online video therapy and if there are people out there who would actually use it over traditional therapy.
5381,"Read some self health books, possibly therapy, and try to lose some weight."
5382,Ive been suffering from depression for the past five years and have seen therapists and doctors and been treated for it without any issues.
5383,"So far the therapist is saying social anxiety disorder and today brought up avoidant personality disorder, i have no idea... she prescribed me for the past 3 months 60mg prozac with 10mg buspar and it has had no effect... she also says she's confused because i'm the most ""laid back"" anxious person she's ever met.... which i think is because when i'm in situations like at the therapists or one on one's and certain times i'm very melancholy and couldn't give a shit about anything for some reason... like it is impossible to make a decision...."
5384,"Anyway, I finally sought out a therapist."
5385,"If anyone wants to ask me anything about therapy or anything else, feel free to comment or PM me."
5386,I met with a therapist once a week for a year in order to get over my fear of school.
5387,"My parents signed me up with CAMHS, (the NHS's child and adolescent mental health service,) who assigned me a cognitive behavioural therapist and a psychiatrist."
5388,"My therapist helped the most - we went over tons of cognitive techniques for controlling anxiety and bringing down panic attacks; breathing exercises, alternative thought patterns, that kind of thing."
5389,"I don't know what to do anymore - the medication was ineffective, my therapist eventually ended my sessions because, in her words, ""there's nothing more I can teach you, all you can do now is apply what you've learned to situations."""
5390,"I know that seeing a therapist is the answer, but a.)"
5391,"I have *NO* money to even pay copays, c.) I would have to make an appointment and find a therapist, which seems like an overwhelming task and d.) I would have to talk to my parents about it."
5392,"Unfortunately, I can't get in to see my therapist because of scheduling conflicts."
5393,"I am in therapy, so I am doing something about everything."
5394,"Maybe three weeks ago I started therapy, I was very hopeful, but also extremely anxious, every time I went in I'd have an anxiety attack, it felt like a real chore, kinda like how I felt when I took guitar lessons."
5395,"I dont think I learned anything from it so i emailed the therapist and just quit... My thing is, is I do talk about my anxiety with people, and I've come a long way mentally without the help of a therapist, and every time shes suggested I do something for my anxiety, I've already done it."
5396,"** I've attended a 12 week CBT therapy course a few years ago, it was all right and I learned a few things but unfortunately not life changing, and it didn't touch on my depression bouts or panic attacks at all."
5397,"I've never gone to therapy, seen a medical professional, nor taken any medications for it."
5398,With no help from medication or therapy.... i'm so proud of myself.
5399,"I didn't have money for psychotherapy, but with enough determination was able to break the binge/purge cycle."
5400,"(note: financial situation is still difficult, not as bad as before, but therapy is far too expensive and not practical at this time)."
5401,"Honestly, with the combination of meds and therapy and attending NA meetings (I used to have terrible means of dealing with my anxiety) I've been so much better...almost my old self - which is this crazy, not shy, quick and clever girl...but all these changes are happening."
5402,My therapist literally sent me to this party since it was super transgender friendly and everybody there would be nice and accepting.
5403,"I went through some therapy, writing out my thoughts, cut all the negatives out of my life, went back to school, trying to get into a new hobby, and gotten allot closer to my religion."
5404,"With time, self-help, /r/anxiety and therapy I got better."
5405,This may be due to starting a new workout routine so I started trigger point therapy and 800mg of ibuprofen.
5406,"my therapist explained it to me, but for some reason I can't find anything about it on the internet."
5407,I had a therapist at the time and told him how difficult it was to get along with them.
5408,I am also getting ankther therapist.
5409,I hate therapy and I don't want to go.
5410,Just so ironic that I have anxiety about going to therapy for anxiety.
5411,I have an appointment on Tuesday with my doctor to discuss options as far as meds and possible therapy.
5412,I just got back from a therapy appointment (the first one I've had in years) and it just feels SO GOOD to get some of this stuff off my chest.
5413,"Fellow anxiety redditors, I highly encourage you to seek therapy if you can!"
5414,"So, I've got social anxiety disorder (among other things) and I've recently started therapy."
5415,My therapist wanted me to do a small exposure thing yesterday but I couldn't bring myself to do it because I was too scared (which I feel really bad about now by the way).
5416,"My therapist called this a ""stuck thought""."
5417,"I've seen a therapist, but she tried to tell me it's just an anxiety disorder, not even stopping to make sure I'm properly hearing how much I'm hurting all the people I love."
5418,"Other people do it without drugs or therapists or psychiatrists, and that's what I want too."
5419,He told me instead of upping the dose that he prefers I exercise more and join a group therapy class.
5420,But I had never heard of GROUP therapy for anxiety.
5421,I visited a therapist once and he said I'm fine.
5422,"(I've tried meds and therapy, but my oh so clever brain can still tell me all the scenarios of how she doesn't like me, or what not)."
5423,"After several different methods (you're all familiar with all of them, I'm sure...meditation, exercise, herbal, pills, therapy), I'm starting to get a solid handle on my anxiety."
5424,"My son's father has had anxiety since I met him six years ago, he's gone to meetings, therapy and is on medication and still has anxiety which causes him to sometimes not see our son for months at a time."
5425,I went to a therapist for a while which ended about a month ago.
5426,I went to a university therapist for a bit after that nasty visual one.
5427,I've read self-help books on anxiety and been to therapy.
5428,I've never told any therapists but I think that I maybe should.
5429,After a few horrible flights where I couldn't control myself I started getting therapy and have been flying heavily medicated ever since.
5430,"My parents brought be therapist for about a month before I convinced that, and myself I didn't have anxiety or depressed."
5431,"After just one therapy session and a few days of CBT homework, I feel like I'm in a much better place mentally than I have been in a long time."
5432,I don't know what to do and at the moment don't have health insurance to go back to my therapist.
5433,"I have talked to my therapist about it, but I’d like to see what other people with anxieties make of it."
5434,I've never been to a psychiatrist before and just going to an appointment with one of my school's therapists left me shaking and breathing over-quickly afterwards.
5435,What should I look for/ask for when trying to find a good therapist?
5436,"For several years I have realized these problems and tried many things alleviate it- working out, alcohol (continue to use), antidepressants, therapy...yet none of this really helps."
5437,"I am currently seeing a therapist and he is a real help, its nice to have someone who understands you and doesn't judge you/get angry at you."
5438,They suggested therapy and i think itd be good for me.
5439,I want to know who here goes to therapy.
5440,I read another thread where someone mentioned their mom trying to be their therapist and I laughed because thats what mine is doing now.. its kind of frustrating.
5441,"Therefore I have decided to make a ""coping plan"" for those two month and was wondering if anybody else has some experience with something like this: 

I plan to do some things every day, unrelated to anxiety levels: 
- meditation/mindfulness 
- breathing exercises/imagination of a ""save place""
- start the day with positive thoughts
- take some time off for relaxing in the evening    
- therapy once a week 
- yoga lessons once a week 

right before/during anxiety-triggering situations:
- listen to music on the way there
- reminding myself it does not matter if I fail
- reminding myself nothing bad can actually happen to me there
- remember to breath
- when anxiety gets too overwhelming snap rubber band (I wear one around my wrist for that reason - this kind of helps me to feel a little more in control, I don't know why) 

What do you think?"
5442,I'm a junior in college and last year I went to the counseling center to see a therapist for the first time (a little more than a year after he died and I basically went insane).
5443,She was an intern so I'm not sure I really got the full experience of being in therapy.
5444,"She also told me, during our last session, that she was leaving the school, so if I wanted to continue therapy there I'd have to be switched to someone else and essentially start from scratch, which pissed me off to no end."
5445,"I know I need to see a therapist again, but I'm starting to consider that I may need to start thinking about medication options as well."
5446,"I would like some advice about therapy, or medication, or just any tips or tricks."
5447,I've been going to a therapist and a psychiatrist for several years and I feel like I'm just as bad as when I started.
5448,http://www.freud-sigmund.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Psychotherapy-Depression-Ebook-Scan-David-Burns-Feeling-Good-2Nd-Edition-1999.pdf
5449,It's been a couple months and I'm still scared and anxious and no matter what my therapist says I can't stop thinking about it as I'm walking through the halls.
5450,"Its never going to go away, but with medication, talking about it openly and therapy."
5451,"TLDR: I self diagnosed as having anxiety, want to see a therapist, but do not and cannot get health insurance."
5452,"I've been intermittently going to therapy and taking medications for just over two years now, and the medication(Zoloft) has helped me greatly."
5453,"I am not in counseling or therapy right now due to limited availability, and it's a bit difficult."
5454,"Did the whole physical therapy shindig, etc."
5455,Anyone in my area that can recommend a good therapist for me?
5456,I tried Kaiser and found that it only made my condition worse and my therapist was really aloof and cold.
5457,"Note that I'm in the running to receive therapy for this (in about a month; it's one of the longest waits I've had for anything), so this is in part, a rant; but also to see who's like me here."
5458,I'm learning more about the nature of my problems through therapy.
5459,"Like I said, this time I'm seeing a therapist and I've started on Zoloft."
5460,"After his anxiety diagnosis, he began going to therapy and they (the therapist and doctors) decided that he may not have ADHD after all, that it may just have been an anxiety disorder all along."
5461,He stopped going to therapy because college started again and he didn't take the time to find a new therapist.
5462,"But it's frustrating for me to watch this happen to him, and his first resort is medication without even considering other alternatives like therapy or other lifestyle changes."
5463,"Last few years I have had a relationship with a few different therapists, psychiatrists, specialists, friends, family, whomever was willing to help."
5464,I have started seeing a therapist but I have to stop because I can no longer afford to keep going.
5465,She has started therapy and is on an SSRI.
5466,"My mom is talking about sending me to a therapist which I honestly probably need, but every time she mentions it it sets me back to square one again."
5467,I'm seeing my first therapist on Friday and I'm sure this will come up.
5468,"I am also seeing a therapist and we are working through stuff, but last Friday I was literally sobbing for two hours in her office processing things."
5469,"I also have names of new therapists to try when I move, so I will be pursuing that."
5470,"It should just be an easy first step before I consider long term things like therapy and medication, but I can't bring myself to go!"
5471,"Thanks guys for calling me down, I think I need a new therapist."
5472,I urgently am seeking a therapist.
5473,"I'm seeing a therapist specializing in CBT right now, but I'm also seeing a gender therapist (I'm ftm and taking hormones, which have helped my anxiety immensely)."
5474,"The CBT therapist would rather I not take antidepressants, while the gender therapist recommends that I take them while going to therapy, and then stop taking them eventually."
5475,"I went to therapy for about a year, mostly working on exposure therapy."
5476,"I started having issues again, as bad as pre-therapy, but couldn't make myself go again."
5477,I've also been thinking about going back to therapy but during my last couple of appointments I was actually experiencing anxiety while with my therapist.
5478,Do doctors and therapists do that?
5479,I feel like it would really help if I could just get some medication prescribed to me first so that I can be more comfortable going places/leaving my house - which would ultimately result in me being able to see my doctor and therapist.
5480,"I don;t want to go into every detail but I have tried it all from medications/therapy/meditation/acupuncture/change in diet/cardiologist and finally the beta blocker I am on now that I thought was finally helping but low and behold, here I am posting another story about how much these symptoms bother me."
5481,"My ""conditions"" now have names and I've just started therapy."
5482,What if therapy doesn't work out?
5483,What if I'm in the wrong kind of therapy?
5484,How can I bring this up at my appointment tomorrow without freaking out my therapist?
5485,"I mean, I did manage to calm myself down a little, by doing some breathing and grounding techniques my therapist have taught me about."
5486,It really pissed me off that she says all that when she knows that I've been going to see my therapist for my anxiety issues.
5487,"and i think thinking about it is just making me worry more but i cant just not worry

Most of the time i can keep erections but when the condom goes on or when i try penetration it fades

I think it might be performance anxiety but does anyone have any experience ive already gone to the gp and i might be getting some free therapy."
5488,"I am currently seeing a ""therapist"" who is a LCSW."
5489,The strategy mentioned to deal with anxiety is akin to ACT therapy.
5490,"After a very long battle and after many visits to therapists, psychiatrists and other healtcare providers, I went to a meeting that was listed in the paper for people with anxiety."
5491,Psychotherapy didn't help me.
5492,I Go to therapy but it's only every two weeks and it hasn't helped yet I've only gone twice.
5493,"Background: been seeing a therapist for about 6 months (weekly or so), mostly about my relationships and anxiety I have about intimacy with them."
5494,"I also went through a pornography addiction which I have under control a LOT better now, thanks to therapy and r/nofap!"
5495,"I meditate sometimes, but my therapist said that's more to reduce baseline anxiety, which I feel is under control."
5496,I have a general distrust of doctors and having had a bad experience with a therapist in the past I decided to try and tackle this on my own.
5497,I will probably visit a therapist to make sure I don't fully relapse.
5498,"Hairstylists, massage therapists, physotherapists, music teachers, dance teachers... all have pointed out how tense I am."
5499,"I've been seeing a therapist every week for about a month now, but I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere."
5500,I'm not even sure if it's because the therapist is disorganized or because I can't think clearly anymore.
5501,"So, I realize it's going to be different for everyone, but how long can I expect to be in therapy before things get significantly better?"
5502,Now I'm going through therapy as well as restarting Zoloft.
5503,"I've worked extensively through therapy, medication, and self-help (exercise, books etc) to gain control of my symptoms, which I have in the sense that they don't run my life like they did in college, but I still find myself very frustrated when I obsess over a certain thought for a day or week at a time, only to have it pushed out and replaced with something different like a revolving door."
5504,"They want to take me to therapy, want to tell me to get my mind off of things, they want me to be less anxious, forgetting entirely that these actions alone are causing my anxiety to go through to roof."
5505,"I've been in therapy and been on and off medications since then, dropped out of high school, experimented with drugs and alcohol, all that ""cutting loose"" stuff teenagers sometimes do."
5506,"I also don't have much time for therapy what with school and trying to graduate early, so I'd appreciate if I could get advice that I can incorporate into my everyday life."
5507,"I have tried several therapy groups and seen many counselors, psychologists, and psychiatrists."
5508,"I've done cognitive therapy, been on anti depressants which only made things worse."
5509,Now I am on no medication and have no therapists or councillors.
5510,"I'm thinking about therapy (when I can afford it), but I've never told anyone what I've just typed, so I thought I'd bounce it off reddit!"
5511,"This resulted in me losing my therapist, medication, and everything else keeping me stabilized."
5512,"Edit: Deep breathing and therapy barely put a dent in my anxiety, I desperately need more pills."
5513,"so ive been going to the doctor lately, and i have been trying to convince her that, along with cognitive behavioral therapy, i should probably get some medication(benzos,beta blockers, anti deppreseants, etc.)."
5514,I've struggled with anxiety/depression for a few years now and currently see a doctor/therapist.
5515,One day she got a new therapist and went one day (she couldn't afford the old one).
5516,Her therapist told her Mom that she was suicidal and has tried to OD before (I knew this but I thought the Mom did too) so her Mom checked though every single text message on her phone.
5517,"I haven't had much success with therapy for anxiety, anyone find something that works?"
5518,I've been seeing a therapist and taking medication (paxil) for the last ~6 months.
5519,"I am already seeing a therapist, but only had two appointments yet."
5520,"Anyway, I recommended to her that seeing a therapist would help and she's begun seeing one twice a week."
5521,"THe problem is that I got a text from her saying ""I just always feel so awful after seeing the therapist dude I don't know""."
5522,"When I had spoken to her about the therapist previously, she said that she was surprised that it was some young guy and he's nice but it was just weird for her."
5523,"What should I do, ask her why she doesn't like the therapist?"
5524,"I've had a therapist for a few months now, and that shit doesn't help me."
5525,"I've dodging therapy for the longest time, but I feel that I am finally at the bottom."
5526,"My question really is then, how I can tell my parents that I need therapy for anxiety/depression without letting them know the extent of my problems, but at the same time, I do not  want to be undermining my problem to where the point that they think it's ""nothing to worry about, everyone goes through this, yadda yadda""

I haven't ever really been open with my parents about my problems."
5527,I talked to my mom the other day about everything I've been feeling lately and she thinks I should see a therapist.
5528,I am in therapy and on/in-between medications.
5529,"So, cue a therapist."
5530,Get therapy.
5531,"So here I am again, unable to even think about sleeping since it scares the shit out of me to think about it, thirsty as fuck but not wanting to get up, havent showered in 4 fucking days after I finally got a good schedule going (I'm in therapy right now actually, the simplest chore is the hardest task for me, but I am able to do other things I'm just highly unmotivated and don't see the point in doing something I deem to be stupid or worthless.)"
5532,"However, I did get diagnosed at the end of the semester and now take an SSRI and have been doing therapy this semester."
5533,"I'm going to (finally) talk to my therapist about it, but I was wanting to know if any of you had any good advice for handling it as well, since I'm also too scared and anxious to admit to my professor why I've been missing her classes so much and not doing the homework."
5534,"they're irrational or some times rational fears that i have for at least two months minimum, then i go to see my therapist to help me sort everything out."
5535,"I talked to my therapist about it, and he explained it was anxiety/OCD.... but I was wondering if it makes anyone else feel better to be ""watched over"", like someone is there for you in case you have an urge or thought, to make sure you don't do it."
5536,I'm a 22 yo female who is currently trying to sort out my anxiety with a therapist.
5537,I had a therapist appointment yesterday and we talked.
5538,Is it notmal to have an anxiety attack after going to therapy.
5539,"I face a lot of irrational thoughts and feelings of loneliness and insecurities that really take a toll on my daily life and I'm glad to say that I finally made an appointment to see a therapist, and I'm seeing her/him tomorrow."
5540,I don't know if seeing a physical therapist might help?
5541,"Hi everyone - quick background: diagnosed with ""Anxiety Disorder NOS"" along with depression around 12; PTSD around 15 following an event that happened that year; ongoing issues with social anxiety / panic disorder / generalised anxiety disorder that are more or less under control using just behavioral therapy methods; no medications for depression/anxiety ever."
5542,I can't afford a therapist again.
5543,I've been suffering from anxiety for over ten years and just recently in the past several months have began seeking medical care and therapy.
5544,So I only let that go on for about a week before seeing my PCP for antidepressants and a psychologist for cognitive behavioral therapy.
5545,I made such great progress I stopped going to therapy after about 2 months.
5546,We had group therapy led by the doctors where they talked about anxiety and how THEY deal with it - they talked about things like how they felt stressed before a driving test.
5547,"My work benefits package will cover psychiatry charges so perhaps if everything goes ok, I can think about looking into a therapist if it gets to that point."
5548,"I think my mom has taken me to a therapist once or twice before, so maybe she knows I have anxiety."
5549,"I should probably address that ADHD thing again with high school coming...

Do you think it's worth seeing s therapist if I even have the smallest suspicion that I might have some mild form of mental illness?"
5550,"I went to therapy and went on Prozac, which eventually cured the issue until I was 14."
5551,I don't think I shared this particular issue with this boyfriend; I went to therapy and eventually learned to calm down.
5552,"He apparently attempted suicide (I don't know very much about this, he may have played it up) and was put in group therapy for a while."
5553,I can't see another therapist because we're only covered through Kaiser.
5554,"He's prob gonna suggest therapy, which I'm open to."
5555,"This is my first time seeing a psychotherapist, rather than a counsellor."
5556,"Since I can't stay on my medication consistently enough for it to really work long-term, my doctor has suggested coming off of it completely and replacing it with regular therapy in an attempt to find the root of the problem."
5557,"I've never been to therapy before, and I'm scared."
5558,Have any of you had similar problems if/when going to therapy?
5559,"Could anyone recommend a good psychiatrist/psychologist/therapist (preferably female) in long beach, ca, or perhaps a legitimate search engine (one that you, or a friend has had success with)?"
5560,"Within the first week or so of dating, I did mention my anxiety once - that I had been diagnosed with GAD and that I had gone to therapy to learn how to cope and get it under control."
5561,"No panic attacks since then, and the number of nervous breakdowns I've had since the therapy is extremely low in comparison."
5562,"For the record, my anxiety has been pretty good the past few days, but if it worsens even more, I shall go chat with my lovely therapist."
5563,"So far I've managed my GAD fairly well without medication (regular counselling, hypnotherapy etc), but after a huge anxiety attack on Monday, with the ripples still affecting me now, I was thinking of asking my Doctor for Valium or something similar for when get an attack of severe acute anxiety."
5564,"I'm not in therapy any longer, and while i am still half aware of my DBT skills, i'm not mindful of them like i used to be."
5565,I'm going to be starting therapy next week so I don't have to rely as heavily on Ativan for things like this.
5566,I don't have health insurance at the moment so medication and therapy aren't available to me.
5567,"I have to wait until Wednesday to talk to my therapist about it, and I'm trying to manage until then."
5568,"Things are looking up, I tried going to a therapist, but the one I saw, didn't really help, I had to just try to dig in myself, and luckily for me it worked!"
5569,"Since, I've been dropped by 2 therapists for missing appointments, my anxiety is about not being close to a restroom if I get sick again."
5570,I want to see a therapist because I have no one to talk to and express myself too.
5571,"I don't agree with that model of treatment, I can't put up with 4-6 weeks of this while I wait for effects that may or may not come, and I'm not willing to give up the psychedelic therapy that has turned my world around so many times."
5572,"I've don't have a therapist and I need to find one, but it's hard with my insurance coverage."
5573,"Basiccly I stopped taking meds but told therapist I was for a year ,became a Tucker won't didn't lis my as burgers ."
5574,Now if I tell my fears and shit to therapist I fear they gonna call the cops on me.
5575,"But, I've been in an episode for the past 3 weeks and it seems to be getting worse so I am trying to find a therapist."
5576,Turns out one of my spinal disks has become misaligned and I have to see a neurosurgeon and get an MRI to see if I need physical therapy or surgery.
5577,"Iv tried getting help, therapy, I take 100mg of setraline everyday."
5578,At my past universities (in different states with different therapists) I have had my therapists write me a letter basically explaining my anxiety and that I like to sit near the door in class and sometimes have to leave the room quickly if I start panicking.
5579,He's my only therapist!
5580,My parents want me to schedule an appointment with a university therapist because they say I've seen too much in these past few months.
5581,I'm opposed to the idea and I've never had a need for therapy before but if this persists I might give it a shot.
5582,"I'm trying to find a therapist, but every single one in my area that is covered by my insurance isn't accepting new patients."
5583,At the same time I was referred to see a therapist and psychologist to find a plan of treatment that would work for me.
5584,"That ended up being a combination of medication and talk therapy, I was offered several options for stress and anxiety classes, but those seemed too far outside of my comfort level."
5585,"I went to see a therapist for 3 weeks In February, but felt as if my problems were miniscule in comparison to others so I stopped going."
5586,"I always knew I had anxiety, but I didn't realize how irregular my anxiety levels were until I decided to go and talk to someone about it, a *therapist*."
5587,My therapist is one of the most amazing people I've ever met.
5588,Do **not** feel bad about asking for help or speaking to a *therapist*/*shrink*.
5589,"A lot of times they have a ""mental health"" section which allows you go to see a therapist for free for a certain number of sessions and/or a much cheaper rate."
5590,"Occasionally I meet a therapist type who knows how to react without making things worse, but normal people somehow seem to say *exactly the wrong thing* almost every time."
5591,Maybe in the future when deep brain stimulation or gene therapy or another alternative can treat Severe anxiety disorders I will come back a finish my dream (: but right now my anxiety is too severe.
5592,"After the physically therapy, after taking medication for a while, and after finding out what is wrong with me I still find myself unable to do anything."
5593,I've gone to therapy and have grown exhausted of walking in circles.
5594,"Cognitive therapy was very helpful, along with the occasional xanax."
5595,"We get to meet some of the people in his life, including a new therapist who has challenged him to leave his apartment in 30 days."
5596,I've been to therapy before and idk why I stopped going but I get anxious just thinking about talking to my parents about it because I feel like if they asked me why I wanted to go to therapy I would just start crying and wouldn't be able to explain why I wanna go to therapy.
5597,"I know seeing a therapist is best, but I really want to avoid medication at all cost."
5598,I've been keeping this all from my dad and I think I should call him tomorrow to tell him what happened and tell him I need to see a therapist to get help.
5599,"After several different methods (you're all familiar with all of them, I'm sure...meditation, exercise, herbal, pills, therapy), I'm starting to get a solid handle on my anxiety."
5600,I had a really rough mental health discrimination issue a long time ago and I've spent years hiding what goes on from most people in my life except for my therapist.
5601,I was put on medication and was in therapy for about 2 years and they were not working.
5602,"I've talked to my parents and we're going to see if therapy is an option for us right now, but every doctor I've seen so far has been suggesting hypnotherapy."
5603,"I equate it with stage magic and tricks rather than useful therapy, which seems to be the hinge of whether or not this will work."
5604,Has anyone here had experience with successful hypnotherapy?
5605,I'm still going to go ahead with therapy if we can afford it because I really want help and I don't feel I can do this on my own.
5606,"He's on four different antianxiolytics/antidepressants, has a psychiatrist, psychotherapist, and mental health nurse working with him but he still struggles even to do simple things like choose what to wear or answer the phone."
5607,1-Do you have any success stories of solving anxiety just by psychotherapy?
5608,2-How does psychotherapy compare to medication in terms of its ability to deal with anxiety?
5609,I've recently started therapy (psychoanalytic psychotherapy).
5610,I'm trying to become more informed before talking to my therapist about medication.
5611,"If taking no medication means spending years in therapy without big improvements, maybe I'll consider medication."
5612,"I know you can't tell me how long therapy will take, but hopefully people can talk about their own experience."
5613,I am planning on going to a therapist but right now I am having the worst time.
5614,I know that I need therapy but it is so hard to get myself to go.
5615,"I have heard of neuro feedback, EFT, cognitive behavioral therapy etc but since these all cost money I am trying to find out which one I should go with that has helped the most people."
5616,"I've had mri's, ct scans, blood work, medication, and therapy."
5617,"I did that for about two years, but now have been booze-free for nearly nine months with the help of a support group, a lot of reading on the subject, and now therapy."
5618,"I have a lot of anxiety (especially regarding relationships, but in other areas as well), but have been trying to deal with it in healthier ways (therapy, meditation)."
5619,"From what I've read, exposure therapy almost never works with emetophobia."
5620,"I can't shake it...I have generalized anxiety with an obsessive tendencies to catastrophize situations....
-------------------
I see a therapist and a psychiatrist."
5621,Unfortunately I can not see my therapist every week because of my insurance (I have kaiser) and the therapists provided don't specialize in CBT or ERP(?).
5622,I just wanted to see if anyone has experiences in seeing someone weekly that is trained in cognitive behavior therapy...has it helped?
5623,"I went to therapy for a while and that helped a decent amount, offering me new insight on my problems."
5624,I don't think I need to see a therapist for this as these violent thoughts never take over my mind completely.
5625,"I am in therapy and have been for about a year, but I'm thinking of just going on meds."
5626,I'm trying medicine and therapy.
5627,I went to see my therapist today.
5628,I've been trying treatments and therapy for a year now and have had no success.
5629,I've had 3 different therapists tell me there's essentially nothing they can do for me; I already do the things that they'd recommend for anxiety and they're simply not working.
5630,I even tried homeopathic remedies at the behest of my somewhat hippy therapist (one of my 3) which did absolutely nothing.
5631,"But that dark hole kick started an intense journey of therapy, medication, exercise and mindfulness."
5632,"I need to get help for it somehow, whether through therapy or medication."
5633,My therapist keeps telling me that everyone feels exactly the same about the group as I do but I still can't shake the feeling that I'm about to throw up everywhere.
5634,"Also, I cry in therapy."
5635,"I've asked her in the last few weeks if she would benefit from going to a therapist or something, but she says she already knows all of that, and that it would be a waste of money."
5636,I simply am at a loss – this night is the first that I’ve considered seeing a therapist.
5637,"The first 12 months was really bad, then I started going to therapy and things have been improving since (for the most part), in an up and down sort of way."
5638,"I want to know if just thinking that you should probably go see a therapist is enough of a reason to go see a therapist, even if you're viscerally against the idea and you're not sure if your mind's just fucking with you by altering your perception of your own behaviour, which might be way more normal than you think."
5639,Do I just therapist-shop until I find someone that tells me what I want to hear?
5640,"I don't want to be told that I'm crazy, I don't want to be told that I'm overreacting, and I don't know that therapy wouldn't do more harm than good."
5641,I just haven't had a proper therapy session in 7 months.
5642,Ranted about not having a therapist thanks to being kicked out of a community program because they needed to make room for new patients.
5643,Turned post into therapy session.
5644,"I've been out of therapy for a couple years, and since I've been out this trigger has developed."
5645,I am starting cognitive therapy with my doctor.
5646,"I'm curious as to if anybody has some thought about what I should do, I'm probably going to try to find a therapist later today and possibly go back to my psychiatrist."
5647,"Has anybody had any experiences with cognitive therapy, or group therapy?"
5648,"After being on various ADD/ADHD, anti depressants and mood stabilizers over the past 20 years and intermittent long term talk therapy."
5649,Did any specific medication or therapy help?
5650,"I saw a therapist a few times but I don't think he and I really clicked, and I couldn't really afford it anyhow."
5651,Also when talking to this therapist I spend a lot of time looking at the floor.
5652,"I've been able to use cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to control them, but its been getting pretty horrible lately."
5653,"I've tried going the official route for therapy in my city, but CB therapy wasn't helping."
5654,I already know I have to visit a therapist or something.
5655,"I just have trouble opening up to the therapist and my last one I had really did a number on me, I couldn't stand him."
5656,A few weeks ago I wrote [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1fae7j/i_dont_like_the_way_my_therapist_talks_to_me/) about how I don't like the way my therapist talks to me and how I really don't trust her.
5657,I saw the therapist another couple of sessions but I still felt the same way so today I finally gathered enough courage to speak to the psychologist who referred me to the therapist in the first place.
5658,We agreed that I should see another therapist instead.
5659,I've waited to get help for over a year but it's taken very long + things obviously didn't work out with my current therapist.
5660,"Anyway, the psychologist told me to email the therapist (because I'm too scared to call her) to tell her about my decision."
5661,"She also said to write that the therapist should call her, not me, in case of any questions."
5662,That way I don't have to deal with the therapist (though the psychologist said she'd probably understand).
5663,Music therapists were named the people of the week by ABC News this week.
5664,"Now I'm sitting here, equally manic that my relationship is possibly over and that I'll have to go see a doctor or therapist and acknowledge that I need meds or something."
5665,"I go to therapy and i go to see someone that controls my meds, I think it's called a Physiatrist or something."
5666,"The good news is that I've been seeing a therapist, and I've also been trying zoloft for the past month."
5667,"Because I don't think seeing a therapist is necessary for this, do you know of any online resources that can help me learn to speak more clearly?"
5668,"I talked to my dad about my anxiety today, and he thinks I should see a therapist, and he's completely against meds."
5669,"Hopefully I can get this all in check here, and therapy works for me."
5670,Has anyone gone to therapy for anxiety/stress caused by a similar traumatic health issue?
5671,"I feel very alone (in regards to friendships, and relationships) and the therapy sessions I go to seem to have a fleeting sensation of accomplishment."
5672,"I finally visited a therapist about it, and while I thought she would tell me I was a depressive person, she thought what I had was akin to social anxiety."
5673,"I don't think of myself as a perfectionist exactly (my therapist says that I am though haha), but I find that I get so stressed about how bad I think my paper is going to be that I can't even accomplish any work."
5674,With music as therapy I don't mean creative therapy but actually just listening to music.
5675,"Diagnosed with Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia in 2011, got to therapy and am put on medication for the first time."
5676,"All they did in the hospital was pump me full of meds, send me to some talk therapy sessions, and slap me with an $80000 bill before they discharged me to a homeless shelter in a town I'd never been in."
5677,"I was offered therapy from reputable doctors in the community when the semester began, and I turned it down, thinking ""Hey, you got back into school, your life will be okay now."""
5678,"For several years now I have been in a type of psychotherapy for anxiety, depression and pure obsessional ocd that uses Mindfulness that I have found extremely helpful."
5679,Recently my therapist has been working with me to do a series of exposures to one of my big problems and although she kept adjusting the target to get it to a do-able point I just haven't been able to do it.
5680,"She apologized to me, something no therapist has ever done to me before, for not coming up with way for me to work with this target."
5681,In therapy it just makes me that much more relucant to do the work so better to dip my toe into the target pool instead of full immersion - or better yet start with the smallest shallowest pool and verrrrrrrry s l o w l y work up to the big ones and then dip my toe in for a few breaths testing the waters.
5682,"My schedule is consistent like this for another couple weeks, and I literally haven't had time to see my therapist since June."
5683,"I saw a therapist every week while on my ""break""."
5684,"I have not been to a therapist in nearly 20 years (and that was just for a couple of months when I was 11 or 12), and I have never been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder but I do know that I suffer from anxiety a lot and have some emotional issues and it has all gotten worse in the last few years."
5685,It has been suggested to me by some of my closest friends that I talk to a therapist.
5686,"I have no health insurance so medication, therapists and the like are not an option for me, unfortunately."
5687,"So, I have been seeing a therapist for a little while, and I am starting a coping skills workshop once my Uni starts school again."
5688,"Also, I know that taking meds isn't going to fix my problems, just help me cope along with everything else I am doing (eating healthy, doing yoga, the therapy and coping skills group, etc.)."
5689,"Also, I just started seeing someone and even though he knows I have anxiety and go to therapy (he does, too), he doesn't know I am starting meds tomorrow."
5690,I am on medication and I see a therapist.
5691,I have recently started seeing a perfessional therapist as well as my school's ASACS counselour.
5692,My therapist has not officialy diagnosed me with anything yet as I have only seen her a couple of times.
5693,I will disscuss with my therapist about taking medication and will take with my journal.
5694,"I'll update afterwards on how it goes :)
EDIT: I had my appointment and my therapist wants to diagnose me with OCD, she just wants to consult the child psychologist there first."
5695,But what I see is so warped (and I’ve been through enough therapy to know it’s warped) that I don’t think I’ll ever be able to write something that people can relate to as true or real.
5696,"I see a therapist and have done several IOP's (intensive outpatient programs) as well as inpatient hospitalization, and I don't know what to do."
5697,I know seeing a therapist could be beneficial... if it actually works.
5698,"Despite many counselors and a psychiatrist and, therapies and medications."
5699,It's basically made me want to do anything with therapy anymore.
5700,"But from everyone/everywhere I hear, I hear that therapy is basically required to get better but I honest to God don't even want to see one anymore after today."
5701,I went to a first meeting with a new therapist (D.Psych) today.
5702,"Also, the therapist today kept asking me if I sweat or have rapid heart rate and other things when I'm in a panic attack... when I'm having what I call a panic attack, my only thoughts are either about the pain involved or the fact that I can't inhale."
5703,"I'm a male in my mid-twenties, I started seeing a therapist about three and-a-half talk years ago because of a particularly harsh break-up that I was going through."
5704,"During that time, I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, but me and my therapist believed that I could work through my anxiety through counseling and working on coping mechanisms and that medication would not be necessary."
5705,Seeing this therapist was the greatest thing that I did in my life.
5706,My therapist agreed to make an appointment for me after her business hours so that I could see her as soon as I could get in there.
5707,(If any of you are interested my blog is http://lblimboland.wordpress.com/2014/11/19/in-my-mind-cbt-clearly-brilliant-therapy/)
5708,"I probably also need a therapist, and talking about schools, I stopped going to school at 14 years old after 6 months of school, 3 weeks at 15 years old(second try), 2 weeks at 16(third try)

even sending this thread gives me terrible anxiety."
5709,"My mom refuses to allow me to get medication or see a therapist about it, but it's becoming such a big part of my life, and I need it to stop."
5710,He told me that he did have feelings for me but didn't seem to realize that i'd be open to the idea of waiting to see how he felt after taking medication and receiving therapy.
5711,my therapist said that i should be happy because if everyone noticed me trying to leave i must've had a big impact on them but im not happy i just want to go quietly.
5712,"I've gone to ER multiple times, been on several medications, and have tried therapy with my limited income."
5713,"I've been going to therapy, weekly, for two years and have been on a number of medications."
5714,The first therapist I saw helped me out a lot.
5715,Ive gone to therapists in the past but frankly nothing has helped me.
5716,"After a trip to the ER last year because I was convinced I was going to stop breathing, I started seeing a therapist."
5717,"I didn't really ever feel like I was clicking with her, though, so I decided to stop seeing her and try another therapist in the same office."
5718,"That coupled with the fact that I find the prospect of ""shopping"" for therapists HUGELY daunting and emotionally exhausting meant that it got pushed to the backburner."
5719,"I plan on getting back into therapy, I think I'm either going to try taking some yoga classes or jogging regularly, I've been reading through other posts in this subreddit to try and get to a better state of mind (which has definitely been helping), and I've started talking more about it all to my boyfriend so that I'm not just in my own head all the time."
5720,"But there's no way for me to see a therapist before we leave for the wedding, so I feel like I'm kind of on my own in figuring out how to cope."
5721,"Hey guys, it's been about a year since I started seeing a therapist for anxiety and for the most part things have just not gotten better."
5722,I was suppose to receive counselling to help get me into some sort of therapy to take over where I was stopping at the medication.
5723,"After diagnosis, I went through about five years of talk/behavorial therapy and never took meds."
5724,I do plan to appoint a meeting with a local therapist.
5725,Will I have to sit down and talk with a therapist or do they have magic pills that will make me happy and relaxed?
5726,Yesterday I saw a specialist and she wants to start exposure therapy.
5727,I'd love to hear anyone else's experience with exposure therapy.
5728,And now I'm in therapy which has been going well and I'm currently just prescribe Xanax as needed.
5729,Butu problem now is that I feel like I don't need to go to therapy and don't need to take medicine.
5730,"I'm in therapy, diagnosed, on meds..."
5731,So I've started seeing a therapist and after several sessions she thinks I have social anxiety.
5732,"I got the name of a behavioural health consultant from my doctor, and they’re going to set me up with some counseling/therapy services."
5733,I don’t know if speaking to a therapist will help.
5734,I go to therapy and I'm currently on 40mg of Prozac.
5735,But I feel that the things I'm being taught and helped through in therapy is shit that I can do on my own or learn on the internet.
5736,I honestly feel that therapy is just a waste of my time.
5737,"I didn't realize that this was all that therapy was when I started, I thought that my therapist would like delve into the deepest parts of my mind and find the magic button that makes me normal again, but all that it's doing is telling me things I already know."
5738,"I don't know, maybe it's my therapist and not therapy that's the problem but I can't afford to go anywhere else."
5739,"But it's a temporary fix and I'm afraid that once I get off the meds, all my insecurities and anxieties will come crashing back if I don't continue with this therapy."
5740,I finally asked my pDoc for a therapist recommendation.
5741,"I've never been a huge believer in talk therapy (for myself, anyway), mainly because I had an awful experience with court-ordered therapy when I was younger, so this was a huge step for me to decide that maybe it would benefit me now."
5742,"I dunno, it just seems to me that a therapist should maybe return calls in less than 5 days."
5743,"He asked what I hoped to accomplish from therapy...I told him I wasn't really sure, just that I'd been dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety and that I thought it would be beneficial to have an objective professional to talk to."
5744,"I sort of laughed and said that I didn't think a therapy session was exactly how I wanted to celebrate my birthday this year, so what else did he have."
5745,He told me that he didn't think now was a good time for me to be starting therapy since I seemed to be very resistant to everything and that I should call back when I was ready to start moving forward.
5746,"Geez, what the hell is the therapy session going to be like?"
5747,I'm going to call my pDoc (who's fantastic but not a talk therapist) and tell him what happened.
5748,This is another bad experience for me with therapists.
5749,Is this how therapy runs?
5750,"I'm guessing not, but maybe my expectations of a warm, caring therapist are all wrong?"
5751,i just hate them im going to therapy and a homeopath to find a better way to deal with it all.
5752,"When I move back home I'm definitely going to see a therapist and talk more with my doctor, but if anyone has any advice for how to cope then, it'd be so appreciated."
5753,"I don't have access to healthcare/a therapist that I can get pills from... it's set off by situations when I feel helpless, like when something happens and I feel like there's nothing I can do to make it better."
5754,"I am a 23-yr-old woman, and I have seen two therapists in my lifetime."
5755,"The first was a 'generic therapist', for lack of a better term, that I met with against my will during my junior year of high school because my parents found a suicide note that I had written on my computer."
5756,That therapist didn't help much.
5757,"Two summers ago (when I was 22), I began seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist for a few months before moving abroad, and that time it was of my own volition."
5758,"The therapist never formally diagnosed me with anything, but she often asked me ""if I ever got angry"" and sometimes had a book out on BPD."
5759,"I have really bad anxiety and I just went to my 3rd visit with my therapist.. so far he has told me ""say this meditation thingy"" or ""try to concentrate on a picture or something to take your mind off things""."
5760,"I just want to start feeling better, but I'm too scared to ask my therapist about meds because I don't want him to think I'm some druggie or something."
5761,"I was prescribed 10mg of Celexa for anxiety, because I've reached a point in therapy and self-work where things are not improving much anymore, so I have decided I should try medication for a while and see what happens."
5762,Also tried many therapists to no avail.
5763,Any tips on seeing a therapist for the first time?
5764,I have seen a therapist before (forced by my mom for a few sessions after some bad family stuff went down).
5765,"I am ready to open up and just spill everything to a therapist in hopes of eliminating lingering childhood trauma but I have another problem... About 6-10 months ago I have developed lovely depersonalization disorder which makes it even harder for me to think/speak/communicate clearly, and even more inclined to keep things inside/agree with a ""bossy"" doctor."
5766,"i have no insurance, i cant even get a therapist."
5767,"He took my blood pressure, listened to my heart, looked at my geographic tongue i had been worrying about and told me to look into therapy."
5768,"I'm really not in a position to pursue any professional help as far as therapists or medication goes, and to be honest I'd highly prefer not to go down that road anyway."
5769,"After seeing a physiotherapist, I realized the impact my posture had on my anxiety."
5770,I can't afford to see a therapist outside of this program.
5771,I was diagnosed with PTSD before by a different therapist but now I'm going to someone new who I get to see for the 2nd time tomorrow who thinks there may be more going on and is having me keep a diary of my moods and graph them out.
5772,"Anyway, I think I need more help than the sessions I get with my therapist."
5773,"BTW, I signed up for therapy too, I just haven't started yet."
5774,"I've tried therapy before , with two different therapists, for long periods of time, and I hated it."
5775,That combined with anecdotes from my friends makes me think therapy doesn't work.
5776,I sought out some therapy and was medicated until I learned to control my severe panic attacks without the meds.
5777,"Like I mentioned earlier, I am currently not medicated and not engaged in counseling/therapy."
5778,"Hey guys, going to a therapist is not really an option for me right now and therefore I can't get prescribed with anything pharmaceutical."
5779,"After researching and looking around, my mom suggested a therapist to me that she thinks could really help."
5780,I'm thinking of all the good that is going to benefit from this as well as the fact that the therapist likes to bring her dog to sessions.
5781,"They help me feel more at ease and it's something else to concentrate on when I feel like freaking out because she's going to tell me that I'm a horrible, horrible person that only needs therapy to really realize how shitty of a person I am."
5782,"So, I've finally decided to see my doctor and go with my psychologist's advice to combine medication with therapy."
5783,"I have tried only using therapy/breathing techniques but, I think I'm too 'deep' in this anxiety to overcome it with only those tools."
5784,I was already diagnosed with an anxiety disorder from my therapist but this symptom has never occurred until recent.
5785,"I saw a therapist, was placed on medications, and within a year, felt completely healthy, happy, and confident."
5786,Going to welfare office to sign up on Medicaid in a couple of hours to pay for therapy.
5787,"I've tried meditation, yoga, acupuncture, keeping active, positive self-talk, cognitive behavioral therapy, regular therapy, and medication, among things."
5788,"I've never been to a real therapist or anything, just been somewhat diagnosed by my moms off the clock physiatrist friend since we didn't have insurance."
5789,"Four years of therapy, five pills in the morning, and I still can't walk down the street."
5790,I finally got the courage to call someone professional for help and I've got my first therapy session tonight.
5791,"While I had two therapy sessions prior to my diagnosis with ADHD, school went into full swing and I was unable to make time for further appointments."
5792,"I've gone through almost a dozen therapists because of moving and college, and it's helped, but I still haven't resolved this particular issue."
5793,"So my question to you, reddit, is what do I do while I look for therapy?"
5794,I went to go see a therapist today for some general anxiety problems and for depression.
5795,"*TL;DR My mother doesn't believe in psychiatric medicine, so I have been without medication or therapy for my panic disorder for almost 6 months."
5796,"It was a sight kinda like yahoo answers, but it was ask a therapist or something to that degree."
5797,[Edit] she used to see a therapist but she would lie around his questions.
5798,"I just don't know how to put into words when somebody asks me, whether it be my therapist, peers, or parents, ""Whats the matter?"""
5799,I'm seeing a therapist and am taking 25mg of Zoloft to try and cope and feel better.
5800,Should I see a therapist?
5801,"We have had an incredibly difficult time making any kind of progress, and her dr and therapist both think that medication may help break a downward spiral."
5802,"Hello all, I'm unwell (anxiety and panic attacks) and I'd like to know if anyone would recommend a particular website to get an online therapist."
5803,I live in France and I'd prefer to talk in French (hence the online therapist).
5804,"I've never sought out therapy before, always felt that I just needed to deal with thing, but this past year has been horrifying."
5805,This caused me to have a breakdown and seek therapy.
5806,"I woke up having a panic attack, but got myself out of it and went to group therapy."
5807,"I don't want to see my therapist today, thats my choice."
5808,I told my therapist about it and he wants to put me on another med.
5809,"I'm tired of feeling this way all the time, so at my girlfriend's urging, I made an appointment with a therapist."
5810,I had to reschedule twice now because my therapist has been out sick.
5811,I've tried seeing a handful of therapists and finally found one I really like (yay!).
5812,I've been to a therapist before but I wasn't able to afford going back and forth between seeing him and then going to see a doctor to get the actual prescription.
5813,I was supposed to see my therapist last week and I ended up sleeping through my appointment.
5814,I started going to therapy because my anxiety reached unbearable limits which prevented me from living my life (e.g.
5815,"I hit a wall with therapy, and my therapist doesn't think this is going to work."
5816,"It will be a year with depersonalization this January, and I have gone through many forms of treatment, from talk therapy to antipsychotics."
5817,"Talk therapy didn't help much for me, but a psychiatrist did."
5818,"How can I help her realize that this is something I need to at least try, along with the weekly therapy I've been going to."
5819,"I started seeing a therapist for a few visits, and then I moved and I haven't found a new one."
5820,Or if I should bring it up with my therapist/psychiatrist when I see them next (although I swear I brought it up with both of them before).
5821,"I know my triggers, I know when things are out of control and I have been in fucking therapy for 15 years but sometimes nothing helps."
5822,"I have years of training for whats coming, but I still feel that all my knowledge has just melted away with the fear :( The last few weeks have been composed mostly of me just trying to manage anxiety, with lots of walks, therapy, medication use, etcetera."
5823,"I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years and could never get help cause I couldn't keep a job long enough to pay for it and also I don't have insurance for it and clearly don't have the money for treatment, therapy, etc."
5824,Tldr thanks for the mini therapy
5825,My sister and I talked a lot about our nParents and she's going to enter therapy.
5826,which involves hormone replacement therapy bringing on a second puberty.
5827,"Like, there's some therapies that work for certain people, but I just feel like there's not something that is sure to fix it."
5828,I seriously need help I've been through therapy and nothing helped after 3 different ones.
5829,"I know what this all stems from, I’ve tried multiple therapists and have anxiety medication to take as needed but some days this just controls my life."
5830,So i've made an appointment with a psychiatrist to seek cognitive therapy and medication such a benzos.
5831,"Because medication didn't improved anything, i switched to  psychotherapy, i have it on a weekly basis for the last 1,5 year."
5832,"If I go to a therapist, I'm afraid that I will become reliant on them if another problem props up."
5833,"Hello all, first time posting in a while but things have gotten worse for me in the recent months and I'm considering being booked back into therapy but I won't be there soon enough."
5834,"I've seen a couple different therapists in the past few years, and just recently started meds."
5835,"Hopefully I'll be able to get into therapy soon, but I have to go through the VA (I'm a disabled vet) so its a lot of beaurocracy to get anything done."
5836,She's basically just there to prescribe and monitor meds rather than actually doing therapy.
5837,I haven't been at therapy for a few weeks because my therapist is on vacation.
5838,"The last time I talked to my doctor, I kind of casually mentioned feeling anxious and they told me that it was just stress from school (which it wasn't) and that I should try therapy (which I can't do)."
5839,"Also, is there any way I can get meds without going to a therapist?"
5840,My personal final step is some kind of social support group or maybe group therapy where I actually talk to people aloud about my problem.
5841,"I had a first appointment today for therapy and overslept my alarm, leaving me anxious, upset, freaking out inside."
5842,"As it stands I cannot afford therapy, and I've been on various types of medication and none of them helped me at all."
5843,-I saw a therapist for about 6 months last year because I was having meltdowns and panic attacks.
5844,"I thought I wasn't being sincere with the therapist, even though I wasn't lying to her."
5845,I plan to tell my therapist in person.
5846,I started therapy a few months back but I can't tell if it's going to help.
5847,Has anyone else had their therapist request an answer to this question?
5848,"I'd assume the first step might be finding a therapist - and this is the hurdle that, in some ways, concerns me the most."
5849,"I don't want to waste the time of someone who typically works with patients requiring more urgent and diligent attention; yet, I also don't want to be a sort of guinea pig for someone who typically works within a different field of therapy."
5850,"Are there specific types of therapists I should be looking for (ones that specialize in certain areas), or is it safe to assume that most therapists will have a basic understanding to at least be able to refer to someone more appropriate if they aren't able to effectively help me themselves?"
5851,I dont want to go to a therapist because I can't afford it and I have no time.
5852,I'm seeing my general doctor tomorrow to talk about therapy sessions and medication options.
5853,"I'm a child stuck in a man's body and through all the years he worked to raise me and pay for my college, not to mention years of therapy, the least I could do is offer him a glimmer of hope before it's too late."
5854,I've recently begun psych and therapy sessions.
5855,"After being out of therapy and off meds for over a year, I made an appointment and am going back in."
5856,"My therapist says maybe she feels ashamed of her feelings, and to try to get her to open up to me, but she won't...and she refuses to see a therapist herself."
5857,So basically I was planning on retaking courses to boost my gpa in conjunction with therapy.
5858,I'm not in therapy right now so I feel like I'm lacking a guide here.
5859,"Hi guys,I got a call today from the leader of the group therapy I just signed in for, and I panicked."
5860,"So I mailed my therapist ( a collegue of the leader of the program) that I freaked out and if that woman could mail me, instead of calling me."
5861,"God, I'm so afraid of group therapy."
5862,"So I thought it'd be a good step for me to join a support group as well as my fortnightly therapy appointments, even though filling out the application gave me bad anxiety."
5863,I switched insurance and doctors so now I have to make appointments with mental health (and physical therapy) and dump all of my insanity on yet another doctor and see what they have to say.
5864,I can't see my therapist for a week and I don't know what to do.
5865,I have been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist on a monthly basis since then and taking my medication.
5866,I start treatment tomorrow for therapy to get everything back together.
5867,"I dealt with anxiety when I lived in my home country, but through therapy it resolved itself between the ages of 17-19."
5868,"Seeing a therapist and psychiatrist regularly, yadda yadda."
5869,$30 for 50-minute sessions aren't too helpful - although my therapist is great.
5870,with another doctor and all they've told me is that they can only get me what is next available for my doctor and to expect the same with all other therapists there.
5871,"I have PTSD with anxiety and depression, I've been in therapy and meds for two years."
5872,My GP has already told me that I will very likely require hormone therapy to conceive.
5873,"Since I can remember I've had a problem with my anxiety disorder and I've experienced cognitive, hypnotic, and regular therapy for years and have been on Prozac for a pretty long time, but I knocked medication and therapy out of my life and can confidently say I haven't had a serious anxiety attack in months!"
5874,"He's been doing therapy and taking meds for a year, and yesterday he decided he wants to quit, at least the meds part (he doesn't feel like they're working)."
5875,He's getting a new therapist too.
5876,"It was also kind of shit to hear him go all ""fuck it"" on this, because he's the one who did most of the convincing me to start therapy."
5877,"I feel like he doesn't really have a plan to continue dealing with his problems and it's all on me to get him to do it (even if his family is aware of everything, and even his brother recommended the new therapist he's going to see)."
5878,She was seeing a therapist and taking meds which helped her function a little more normally but now she is on a kick where she doesn't want to be the type of person who takes medicine.
5879,I don't know what I think I can get from a therapist who for all I know is only pretending to care because I'm paying them.
5880,That year i started medication and therapy.
5881,It's loaded with aroma therapy and additionally helps clear sinuses.
5882,I was convinced to go to a massage therapist and I had a bad experience.
5883,"I feel like I'm already trying everything to relieve stress physically (therapy, talking it out, breathing, meditation, so on and so on)."
5884,They both encouraged (insisted) me to go to therapy.
5885,I went in to the doctor and after awhile (and plenty of therapists) I found out I have social anxiety.
5886,"I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression - relatively mild, I believe, as I'm only receiving counseling and no therapy or drug treatments."
5887,"But when I approached my mum about it, she told me I received speech therapy for a stutter when I was younger, after that I didn't stutter again."
5888,I am seeing a therapist but this stuff causes my head to spin everyday.
5889,"I realize I should see a therapist regularly, which I plan on doing."
5890,"**

If you haven't gotten help yet, or slacked on therapy or your meds, go get help!"
5891,"My family never understood my anxiety, or had supportive methods for dealing with it, aside from paying for therapy, so I don't mention it to them."
5892,"I don't have a lot of money to use on therapy right now, so I wanted to know if you guys had any exercises that worked well to kind of push those thoughts out of the mind."
5893,"I have been doing my best to get through CBT therapy, but there are just some things that will cause non-beneficial anxiety."
5894,I am seeing a therapist and am trying to work out my problems.
5895,"Unfortunately to get better my therapist wants me to talk about my experience and what led me to the hospital but every time, I get a nauseating feeling and start having a panic attack."
5896,"I've been talking to a therapist about this, but it's not really going anywhere."
5897,"I want to try going to therapy, as it's a tried and true way to help yourself get over some of your issues."
5898,I think that I could influence others who may be considering therapy to go if they were to hear my sessions and possibly my commentary on the sessions.
5899,I don't have a therapist anymore because I was doing well for a while but I would see her again if it helps to legitimize things for my employer.
5900,"I began seeing a therapist, and they think I may have a subconscious fear of intimacy."
5901,I don't have a job but I have a business that currently doesn't bring a lot of money in so I can't afford to see a therapist or pay for prescription drugs.
5902,I heard from my therapist people who do that kind of thing hear voices so I have been thinking I'm schizo or I have aspergers.
5903,"Lately I've been under a lot of stress, which has certainly amplified my symptoms, and I'm searching for a new therapist."
5904,"I stopped asking my therapist, which is bad I know, but I felt like she wasn't helping."
5905,"Then, after changing many psychotherapists, I found one that to me felt like the ""right one"", and I was right."
5906,After a relatively short psychotherapy (a little more than 1 year) I am now completely drug and panic free.
5907,I will be doing therapy as well with the psychologist that I visited yesterday.
5908,I'm going to post here on reddit as well as do therapy.
5909,I've always had the urge to try therapy but am curious if it would actually help me.
5910,I'm in the process of getting insurance and don't have a healthcare provider right now so meds or therapy aren't an option.
5911,I started seeing a therapist regularly at the end of March and it's definitely helping me get over the hump.
5912,"Now, when I talked to my former school counselor she mentioned once cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to me."
5913,"I've been to a therapist, it seemed like easy answers and a book recommendation for $100 a session, i didn't find value in it and she was pushing me into situations that i didn't think i could handle or goofy activity sheets."
5914,are standard therapists who i need?
5915,I don't have health insurance so therapy and ongoing medication isn't an easy option.
5916,"I've been in and out of therapy since I was very young, but I haven't had much progress."
5917,"I went on a low dose of anxiety medication and saw a therapist for a semester, which dealt with my problems at that time."
5918,"Also, I heard Welbutrin is good to avoid the sexual issues, but my therapist (not my psychiatrist, so she may be wrong) told me that it can make anxiety symptoms worse."
5919,"Around that I probably visited my local GP 15-20 times, which eventually resulted in me seeing a therapist once a week for 10 weeks."
5920,"I'm currently in group therapy at my university, but I don't feel like it's helping me any because other people in the group dominate the conversation and I am too shy to talk about my personal problems with people I barely know, as I feel my problems are stupid and will make me look bad."
5921,"I want to start individual therapy again, but my university's mental health center is currently backlogged and has a waiting list of 40+ people waiting to see therapists, so I think that treatment is out of the question."
5922,As my therapist told me last week.
5923,This is my first experience with a therapist....is this normal?
5924,"Having therapy, isn't helping my heart to calm down."
5925,I have therapy later today too so hopefully that will help.
5926,"Without meds/therapists, is it possible?"
5927,"**Bottom line**: Without meds and without therapy, is there a chance the Generalized Anxiety would ever go away?"
5928,I'm actually going to therapy in a few days to help.
5929,"Hey all,

My therapist has basically been shoving mindfulness down my throat, (which I know is a problem in and of itself) but I have this bad taste in my mouth about it."
5930,"I've started going to therapy recently and was told about the dangers of engaging in avoidance behaviours, and how I should learn to ""be with"" the anxiety instead of fleeing."
5931,That cognitive behavorial audio therapy by Dr. Thomas A. Richards..
5932,"Hey so I have started going to therapy and taking meds regularly to help me cope with my anxiety and other issues, but I have been smoking marijuana for 12years and I would say for at least 6years its been habitually everyday all day."
5933,"(26, M, G.A.D., Triggered by everything, No medication, U.S., VA Healthcare which doesn't provide good therapy, Too poor to afford therapy out of pocket)

Thanks in advance."
5934,I received therapy a while back but the second I was diagnosed with something I was given meds and my case was dropped.
5935,"I've gotten therapy in the past, and have made great progress with it, but now I feel like I've fallen off the wagon."
5936,"I've seen a therapist before now, and would still if it were not for monetary situations."
5937,I'm tempted to get a journal where I can write down the lingering thoughts I have at night (something my therapist suggested) and to make note of triggers and other stressers.
5938,She has had issues with therapy in the past and expressed to me that she finds it hard not to subscribe to her diagnosis.
5939,"I'd like to get diagnosed mainly so that I can start either seeing a therapist, take some meds, or just do more yoga (although arguably, I could just do that last part now) and see it as treatment."
5940,I've snowballed into massive depression and anxiety due to a relationship not working out and saw a therapist for the first time today.
5941,I went to a therapist and learned cognitive techniques (mostly because I wanted to avoid drugs).
5942,I've been in therapy for nearly two years now.
5943,How do you tell when you are done with therapy?
5944,"My mom, even though she confessed to having the same problems, tells me I can't get treatment (not even therapy), for it because it's something every teenager goes through."
5945,She pulled me out of therapy five years ago as soon as the therapist was telling me things she didn't agree with...
5946,I even been to 1 on 1 therapy from a physiologist which again has helped but no where near enough to sustain a normal life.
5947,"I've started therapy, but I see the psychiatrist today."
5948,"Since then, I stopped therapy for ~4 years."
5949,"The therapist and I worked together to sort through the disorder, as well as trauma (I was raped as a teenager and then tried to kill myself.)"
5950,"She was a student therapist, though, so couln't properly diagnose me."
5951,"When she graduated, I moved on to a new therapist who had a degree and was qualified to diagnose me."
5952,"TL;DR diagnosed with depression as a teenager-&gt;therapist said I might have an anxiety related depression-&gt;I get weird days where I feel nervous, scared, sick, shaky all day and have no idea what it is."
5953,I have an appointment with a cardiologist next week and also a therapist.
5954,I believe they are intrusive thoughts as apposed to suicidal thoughts because I am truly afraid of them and do not want them to happen at all but my subconscious seems to (hence the therapy appointment) but I won't let it.
5955,I have gone to therapy for this but that was a long time ago and I thought I was over it.
5956,Second was the therapy; talking to someone along with the meds would help drastically.
5957,I won't have time to see a therapist until after exams and I just want to cry all the time.
5958,"I'm going to start that course of therapy, which is a positive thing, but so many things are uncertain at the moment (not least where the hell I'll be living or studying this year), and I just needed to type for bloody ages to help deal with it apparently, because I keep breaking down either into panic or hopelessness and Jesus Christ this got long."
5959,I finally got the nerve to start going to therapy last December for my issues.
5960,"(PTSD, major depressive disorder, anxiety, OCD)  Well I've been going once a week for a group meeting and then once a month for a one on one with my therapist (We'll call her ""A"")."
5961,"I went in for my one on one the Thursday before last and ""A"" wasn't there so I saw her supervisor instead and told him that I would like to change therapist because I felt like my sessions were more about ""A"" than about helping me with my problems."
5962,"Seeing as things are pretty serious, she had a behavioral therapist just come in and talk with me for a bit."
5963,I tried my best and he said he will refer me to a therapist or something.
5964,I was in therapy last year and I am going back to my therapist in two weeks.
5965,I work as a therapist and I am around people all the time.
5966,I've heard that a lot of therapists get cancer and that really scares me too!!
5967,"She was a clinical therapist at NYU, and was getting her masters degree and writing her dissertation the year I moved to NYC."
5968,"She was in school to be a therapist, and was not very understanding to the anxiety I felt, even though she herself was known to have anxiety attacks."
5969,"I started seeing a therapist right off the bat, and had 2 different ones (Not at the same time) my 3 yrs."
5970,"Things that've helped are things like exercise, therapy (every week if possible), as well as eating well and having someone other than your therapist to talk with."
5971,"My pessimistic nature says ""it's too early to tell"" and ""don't get your hopes up"", and I want to give in to those notions so badly, but I know deep down that therapy will be fruitful in the long run."
5972,"I know I need to see a therapist before I can make a proper decision, but I don't have insurance and I'm not going to pay hundreds of dollars for someone who couldn't care less about my problems to listen to me complain and then tell me to come back next week and pay them a few hundred more dollars."
5973,"What could therapy do for me, in this situation, if I refuse to take anti-anxiety medication?"
5974,Today my therapist suggested that we don't set a new appointment and that I should just call in a few months to follow up on my progress.
5975,"* Therapy, if you find the right therapist, it will help massively."
5976,My therapist gave me tools to handle panic attacks and he made me realise that I wasn't actually going insane (big relief!).
5977,"I saw my therapist today, and she told me that when she looks at me, she sees someone with determination."
5978,I recently had my first session with a therapist about these anxieties and others.
5979,I was (don't have time now because of school and extracurriculars) seeing a therapist that was really good for me.
5980,I still am scared everyday to why I am feeling this way.. and I start my psychological therapy or whatever this Wednesday.
5981,"When I was 12 years old I had a therapist tell me I was ""lazy,"" because that therapist met with my asshole father before meeting with me, and my father essentially told the therapist how to view me."
5982,"When I was 22, I spent 8 months in psychotherapy and saw no results at all for anxiety."
5983,I found cognitive behavioral therapy.
5984,A good therapist for anxiety must WORK WITH YOU.
5985,"From my experience personally, and from reading books on CBT, including instructor manuals, a good therapist should direct you to RESULTS quickly."
5986,"If your therapist is not helping, don't fret."
5987,"I had some cognitive behavioural therapy, which was ok. A better way of dealing with it for me was to change things in my life that were making me deeply unhappy."
5988,Also I only went to therapy once or twice.
5989,But I'm pretty sure it came with some meditative relaxation therapy with my psychiatrist.
5990,And I don't know why I'm coming here because I've not been to a therapist or anything and I don't even know if I have diagnosable anxiety.
5991,"I’m embarrassed by these fears and I don’t like to talk to others about them, although I have been to therapy and talked to loved ones about them a little."
5992,"I don't have a therapist, family doctor, psychiatrist or counselor I can turn to."
5993,Her anxiety: She sees  a psychiatrist monthly and just started her personality testing from a psychologist in order to go to regular therapy.
5994,"BTW, I'm also in therapy but I feel that isn't enough."
5995,I have my first appointment Monday with a therapist but it seems like years away.
5996,I have been in therapy for 2 years and practice mindfulness and meditation to challenge the intrusive anxious thoughts.
5997,"http://anxietyandracingthoughts.wordpress.com/2014/04/17/a-response/

I hope this pushes some people to consider therapy before deciding it won't work for them."
5998,"I sought therapy, but he had to cancel one and asked to see me a week later but between being crazy and working I didn't call him back so after a week of absence he closed my case."
5999,"Anyway, I went to a therapist who eventually got me taking Effexor and it's really helped out, for the most part."
6000,"I'm 19 years old and although I'm not officially diagnosed with any anxiety disorder as of now, I've been told by therapists in the past that I most likely have general anxiety disorder."
6001,"Referred me to a psychiatrist who wanted to make me wait 4 months for an appointment, so went to therapy instead."
6002,I blew all my money on a therapist.
6003,There's no time to see a therapist before then.
6004,"My therapist wants me to, each day, plan a detailed schedule ahead of time in the hopes that it will help me in this regard."
6005,"10 years ago I was diagnosed with quite a few mental health issues, nothing extremely serious..the ""worst"" diagnosis was panic disorder (with many years of therapy, training and support, I have a less than 5 panic attacks a year now)."
6006,I'm going to see a new therapist in a few weeks but I'm just frustrated and can't sleep and wanting to rant.
6007,I'm on needs and therapy but if I change my routine I sill panic.
6008,So my sweet husband made me an appointment with his therapist to see if she can help me.
6009,I stopped going to therapy and have been focusing my efforts on being healthier.
6010,"I've tried CBT and Propanolol, this time my checklist is to try a new, more 'aggressive' medication (I was on a very low dose before), start seeing a psychotherapist to help understand **why** I have this constant feeling of dread, and to get a formal written diagnosis."
6011,"I've been seeing a therapist since October, currently attend an anxiety/depression support group, and am working on mindfulness techniques."
6012,"* is there anything that I could try besides therapy, mindfulness, timers/schedules (the 45/45/30 model worked for me for a while, but has lost its powers of late), and medication?"
6013,"I recently started therapy on this, but I only have gone to 1 session so far."
6014,"I used meditation and healthy eating for awhile, and I also saw a therapist briefly, but I can't even get myself to do that."
6015,"I go to a therapist and talk and i did so in the past, as well as take medicine, but at the moment i don't take anything."
6016,I was just talking to my friend the one guy besides my parents who know about me going to therapy.
6017,"I told him I'd be late to a STUco meeting(student goverment, To which im junior class president) because of  therapy appointment."
6018,"In highschool I was in therapy for Major Depression, generalized anxiety, OCD tendencies (stemming from my anxiety), and social anxiety."
6019,I just hated medication and therapy helps but sometimes it is hard to make is functional in the moment.
6020,"That being said:

I've found out, over the years of ""dealing"" with it, through reading several books (Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart, Feeling Good  by David Burns, the Anxiety and Phobia Workbook, the Bible, Buddhist meditation), *and through visiting a trained therapist*, a couple of tips and tricks that might help you."
6021,My therapist commented that at my rate of improvement with my anxiety that I might not even need to try taking anything else which was encouraging.
6022,"I've been seeing a therapist since June and though I've had a few job interviews, haven't had a job since March."
6023,"I am from an hour north of the city, and though the commute wouldn't be bad to see my old therapist up here, I really would prefer to see someone in the city where I go to school."
6024,"I really need and want to go see a therapist, someone that will actually help me and someone I can trust and talk to (my parents are impossible to talk to) I really want to tell them I need this."
6025,"I tried to tell my mom a couple of weeks ago, and she told me to try to talk to her like I would talk to a therapist."
6026,I really want to talk to a therapist but i am a minor and i really cant talk to my parents about it because every time i do try to i end up having a panic attack how can i do this with out freaking out?
6027,I've seen a range of therapists for a long time and lately I've been asked to consider using a mild anti-psychotic.
6028,"I'm on my meds and therapy, but almost everyday (if not everyday) I feel the same thing."
6029,I'm going to the doctor to see what kind of regiment I can get back on with meds and/or therapy (I've done both in the past).
6030,"My therapist suggested getting a book called ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns."
6031,He also offers suggestions about how to change your ways of thinking (through cognitive behavioral therapy) and have TRULY helped me get out of my goddamn head.
6032,"When I realized I couldn't do it anymore, therapy, PHYSICALLY WRITING OUT AFFIRMATIONS (""You're a solid dude, hampsterman22."
6033,"I finally broke and confessed my need for help, and my mother berated me, called me lazy and ""weird,"" and told me I didn't need help, I was faking, therapy is worthless, drugs only hurt your body."
6034,"Things fell apart when my insurance told me that SA was preexisting and I'd be paying in full for every previous visit, and after two cognitive behavioral therapy sessions, I had to cancel any future appointments with my psych and therapist."
6035,I started seeing a therapist back home and another one when I got to school and I've found it helps quite a lot.
6036,I booked myself an appointment for nutritional therapy.
6037,I suffer from GAD and panic disorder and treat them with both meds and therapy.
6038,I've tried too many times and now I'm gonna spend some money on nutritional therapy and hope a professional can help me with this.
6039,"If someone has gone and actually seen a nutritional therapist, I would be delighted to hear about your experiences!"
6040,I might start getting counselling or a therapist in college to help me out.
6041,"I have yet to seek out therapy, but I have looked all over the internet for situations similar to mine and have had no luck."
6042,"My mental health contact, in regards to the ADHD is gone for the weekend and I haven't really seen a point in calling the on-call therapist."
6043,It also upsets me that a therapist may see this as an attempt to get more drugs...
6044,"My dr. and therapist are both convinced the symptoms are because of my ~anxiety~ but I rarely have any really fearful, panicky thoughts?!"
6045,I've been to therapy in the past.
6046,"I don't want to face all of the censure I know for a fact is there: For the last 72 hours, I've skipped almost all of my classes (including a vital presentation) and only emerged for three meetings-- one with a classmate &amp; professor for a project, one with an advisor, and one with my counselor/therapist."
6047,"I am currently waiting for my psychiatrist's office to call back and let me know once there is an opening with a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist -- I think it's time to go back to therapy, for sure."
6048,What if he recommends a therapist?
6049,"I go to therapy once a week and I am on 20mg lexapro, have been for like 9 years, so I feel like it isn't working anymore."
6050,Despite my attempts at medication and therapy I cant escape it.
6051,My therapist has recommended trauma therapy which I start next week.
6052,i want to talk to a therapist but it takes like 3 months to get an appointment in my town and i feel a bit scared at the moment about what my body is doing.
6053,Things are wonderful for a day or two after his last therapy session when he's full of hope and optimism for a future together but then it just kind of goes away.
6054,It's like I don't even exist until after his next therapy session where he'll apologize for his behavior and make attempts to make it work.
6055,Seeing a therapist.
6056,"I had an interesting conversation with my therapist the other day, and I wanted to share and solicit opinions from every one here on r/anxiety."
6057,"Years ago, I went to a therapist who also recommended I go to a psychiatrist."
6058,I went for years not going to the therapist because I felt I had things under control.
6059,"Anyway, now years later I started going to my therapist again, and am glad I did."
6060,"I asked my therapist his opinion on how the medication is helping me, as he sees many more people with anxiety than I do."
6061,"My therapist said, anecdotally Wellbutrin XL seems to work very well for anxiety (although labeled for depression)."
6062,"I have talked to 2 therapists, they were completely worthless."
6063,It's the magical drug that I have been on for too long instead of going to therapy and dealing with my problems.
6064,"I am feeling more and more like I need a medication to help control my ridiculous anxiety, and then I also should start therapy on the side to help myself get to a place where I eventually don't need the medication any longer."
6065,Could anyone please tell me how therapy works in Australia?
6066,"I recently moved here, and I am terrified and really need help - but I don't know where to start..

* Do you need a referral from a GP to see a therapist?"
6067,* Is there a difference between therapy and counselling here?
6068,* How do you find a therapist who practices what you need (like CBT)?
6069,* How much do therapy and meds typically cost?
6070,"Just because I don’t want to talk to a therapist or see a doctor anymore but even though I had such a great time last semester, I know I’m not “better”."
6071,"He's already been seeing a therapist for years, has been taking various types of prescribed medications and has been attending various addiction programs."
6072,"I've been diagnosed with Depression/Anxiety for a little over 12 years now, and I've had it pretty well under-control with therapy and a series of medications (Paxil, Zoloft, Lexapro, in that order)."
6073,"I saw a counselor at grad school, a psych student, who certifiably made things worse by trying out [Imaginal Exposures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolonged_exposure_therapy) with me."
6074,She sees a psychiatrist and is looking for a therapist.
6075,"I've done therapy before, but never for anxiety/panic attacks."
6076,I'm really hesitant to go back to therapy; it's difficult for me to find someone I really mesh with and respect.
6077,"The one time I was able to make it into the therapist, that's how she diagnosed me, but I didn't care for her personality, so I'm trying to find someone new."
6078,I know I should see a therapist but my mom doesn’t think that I have a problem.
6079,I’m also under her insurance and I have no idea how to find a therapist that is covered by it.
6080,"I just started going to therapy for this...so, hopefully, my therapist and I can work together on beating this monster."
6081,"She's told me she's been talking with her therapist about it, but to be honest I've only seen a small amount of results and on some days it's so bad that I- a grown man- curl up into a ball and cry because of how hurtful the things she says are."
6082,Just when I thought I had overcome my fear of schizophrenia and made real progress with my therapy something as alarming as this crops up.
6083,"I haven't been to therapy in over a year, but I can't really afford it anyway."
6084,"I've recently been dealing with a lot of anxiety, and while there are many different ways of dealing with it, medication, meditation, therapy, or the million other things you can do, I have found a really easy way to take about 1% of the edge off, and I'm sure a lot of people do it."
6085,"If you're able to even discuss your findings with someone, whether it be a trusted friend or family member, or a therapist, it could be useful information!"
6086,"I have seen regular physicians, neurologists, psychiatrists, therapists, I even went to my OB to rule out any hormone or birth control problems.."
6087,"Thankfully, the institution I belong to has a therapist I am quite fond of."
6088,"So my girlfriend has been pushing me to get help, so I took the step and made an appointment with a therapist my friend/coworker recommended."
6089,"A lot of things are going through my mind: I'm nervous about talking about my intrusive thoughts, I'm nervous that the therapy won't work, and I'll just be fucked up forever, and I have a slight worry that my therapist won't understand the extent of how bad my anxiety/OCD is, and won't want to see me anymore or something like that."
6090,"And I'm trying to be positive about the therapy process, and that it will help, or that I'll get on medication that will help me."
6091,"Yes, I need to do the work myself, but obviously this treatment strategy (talk therapy, with an without Lexapro) isn't having a huge success."
6092,I'm going to my first therapy session later today.
6093,"I'm not sure how I feel about therapy, I'm gonna go again next week then decide whether I want to continue or not."
6094,"My mom urged me to go see a doctor and therapist, and I did."
6095,I managed to get into weekly therapy and start on a small dose of the antidepressant Lexapro.
6096,With the help of therapy and medication I feel reborn.
6097,"We had begun to see a therapist together, but shortly afterwards we had a series of terrible fights that resulted in me moving out and back home with my mom."
6098,"First, I don't have health insurance so I don't take medications or visit a therapist."
6099,I have made an appointment to start seeing my therapist again but i'm just really down about this whole situation.
6100,"i've been down this road before, was on sick leave for a few months, been to therapy and the doctor and it's nowhere near as bad as it has been, but still."
6101,I've been going to therapy for over a year now and while that and medication seem to help nothing really changes very much.
6102,"It's nighttime here, so I can't call my therapist for an appointment until tomorrow."
6103,"My therapist suggested forcing myself to socialise whilst finding a hobby, to help with my anxiety and depression."
6104,My psychiatrist and therapist have noticed changes as well as my family.
6105,"Meds, therapy, exercise...."
6106,I used to get therapy but didn't like it at all.
6107,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
6108,I have also spoken to a therapist and it was a great help.
6109,My friends are sick of hearing about this stuff and idk how I feel about actually talking to a therapist.
6110,"I've been in and out of therapy for years, but I just wanted a chance to be really honest about my situation and see if anyone else out there has experienced the same thing."
6111,"My therapist and I were working so well with everything, I was going to work regularly and school getting fair grades but after the other night and being off my meds I'm defeated."
6112,I've tried therapists.
6113,My therapist told me to resist the urge to sleep and to stay active.
6114,Even the therapists and psychiatrists I go to can only sympathize and try their best to help me but most of them can't empathize with the misery and anguish I enconter on a daily basis.
6115,"I'm seeing my therapist on Friday, but I'm seriously considering skipping class on Thursday and Friday."
6116,Would they insist I go on medication and see a therapist?
6117,"When I first started treatment, I was anxious about every aspect of life, but thanks to sertraline and regular therapy, my anxiety level has gone down to basically nonexistant most of the time."
6118,By the way I don't want to take meds and I already am seeing a therapist.
6119,"The job has been going alright, but the health insurance doesn’t cover anything until I hit my ridiculously high deductible, so I can’t afford my therapy or medication anymore."
6120,"If I quit my job I’d qualify for medical assistance and be able to go to therapy, but then I’d lose my house and my boyfriend would leave me and I’d have to move back in with my parents and my abusive sister, and my life would be over anyway."
6121,"Besides, what point is therapy if you have nothing in real life to apply it to?"
6122,"I'm going to start a course of cognitive behavioural therapy, but I have tried that before and it didn't seem to work much at all."
6123,"So after a long time really wanting help but feeling it would be difficult, I've decided I want to seek help from a therapist."
6124,In a few days I'll be seeing my therapist again.
6125,So how does one like me build rapport and trust between the therapist?
6126,How did you learn to trust your therapist?
6127,I identified in therapy that it is anxiety because I become very agoraphobic and restless.
6128,I am seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist.
6129,"F/26/US/insurance covers therapy (going to my third session tomorrow), medication and doctor visits."
6130,But even through extensive DBT therapy Ive seen 0 change in the level of anxiousness over the last 8 years.
6131,"I for one, feel like I probably suffer from clinical depression and the only person who could help me is a therapist and that by no means does this make her inadequate."
6132,I plan to start therapy soon and try meditation and other methods to change my outlook but I still feel such a hopelessness that it makes it hard to put forth the effort.
6133,"I may end up seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist at some point, I don't know."
6134,"Celexa has stopped working and I've finally gone to see a psychiatrist (I also am in CBT with a therapist), and she's put me on Prozac (20mg)."
6135,I'm considering talking to a therapist.
6136,"Bumping the dosage, talking to a therapist, anything."
6137,"Their services include a 24hr anxiety and depression hotline, weekly community lectures, live-streamed anxiety related t.v, free scheduled therapy sessions; as well, they act as a medium to get individuals into low or free local therapy."
6138,"So, after a traumatic, horribly strong urge to want to kill myself, I decided it was time to see a therapist again."
6139,"I had seen a therapist for a solid year after having my first, full blown anxiety/depressive episode (screaming, crying, hitting myself), but I like all those who suffer with anxiety, I felt judged, annoying, and as if the woman didn't like me."
6140,"I started seeing a therapist, free at my University."
6141,"Yes, I do attend therapy and have for what I think is almost four years as of now."
6142,My therapist diagnosed me with ADD today.
6143,I found out from a therapist that I had experienced a panic attack.
6144,I saw a therapist for a couple sessions but stopped because of a financial confusion.
6145,"I should probably see a therapist, shouldn't I?"
6146,"We go through these cycles of therapies and meds and fads and ideas, but we're only ever knocking the wind out of it for small periods, it's a losing battle."
6147,"I'm getting weekly 1 hour therapy sessions through my college, but it might be too little, too late."
6148,"Do I try to make it into a conditional therapy session, or do I avoid it?"
6149,"My sister, dad and i have come to the point where we NEED to get her help but we are afraid that we will just make her defensive and even more turned off from the idea of therapy."
6150,"Does anyone have any advice - something that was said to you, something that spurred you to go into therapy, any preference on whether a discussion vs a letter would be better?"
6151,"My therapist even said I am too negative for him to be of any help, unless I can try to pull myself out of it a little (and I feel therapy has been not helping anyway)."
6152,These three things have really made a giant difference in my life along with cognitive behavioral therapy.
6153,"How can I help him to find a therapist, deal with the cost, and deal with the fact that talking to someone about this makes him deeply uncomfortable?"
6154,I have been on anxiety therapy (venlafaxin) which didn't help a lot it seems.
6155,"I have also started taking anxiety management classes, and I see a therapist (although not often enough because kaiser permanente mental health services suck)."
6156,"I'm planning to try and make an appointment with my therapist this week, but I'm wondering if r/anxiety has any advice for me."
6157,"I've tried SSRI's (no no no no no no), I've tried therapy (too expensive--insurance doesn't cover it at all and the therapist I saw pretty much told me going to college will help greatly, if not cure it altogether,) and I've tried dealing with it on my own (obviously not working?)"
6158,"I've never been to a therapist, even though I've had these events where the worrying goes on for a long period of time."
6159,"In the case of a daily schedule, which my therapist has tried with me to help with my time management anxiety, I get anxious about losing the spontaneity of the day, like I'll become a robot following a program."
6160,I suffer from chronic depression and have been fighting for the past few years to get the right balance of meds and therapy.
6161,"I work as a structural drafter at an engineering firm and I have a really good insurance plan, but unfortunately it doesn't cover very much in the way of therapy."
6162,I went to a therapist last year for anxiety because I was living with my parents still and I could afford it.
6163,"I can't afford therapy anymore, and I need to fight this anxiety."
6164,"I've resorted to having a few drinks spread out through the day to cope - this is not sustainable

I need to pursue some form of psychotherapy (CBT?)."
6165,"I don't have insurance, but I will go to CBT or a therapist when I can."
6166,Is this something that warrants a therapist/psychologist?
6167,I've been thinking about going to therapy a lot here lately.
6168,(cognitive behavioral therapy to be more specific) And I was curious on how it may have worked for some of you.
6169,Anyway maybe I should go back to therapy?
6170,I just thought I'd post this as a reminder to be diligent with taking your medication and working in therapy.
6171,"I think therapy would be helping me, but I feel like I do my sessions wrong."
6172,I don't answer my therapist's questions right.
6173,"I have a therapy session in 3 and a half hours, and I am overwhelmed."
6174,"I know everyone is different and that meds and therapy are generally the best route, but is there any unique way YOU or someone you know has gotten over these attacks?"
6175,So my therapist recommended me to take anti-depression to help treat my anxiety.
6176,I've been getting treatment (meds &amp; therapy) for anxiety and depression for a few months now.
6177,My therapist has taught me some CBT/mindfulness techniques--and things have been working because as a whole I feel not as bad as before--but it only helps up to a point.
6178,"I've been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for almost two years, and I've been on more medications than I can remember, yet I've continued to slowly get worse the entire time."
6179,So I am going to see my therapist and talk to him about it but I just feel defeated about it.
6180,"I am currently looking for a therapist to help me with this, and (I) am highly opposed to anxiety pills."
6181,"Do you have any success stories, or suffer from something similar, or has therapy worked for you?"
6182,"Looking for a therapist, hoping for Eastern Medicine approaches, and to learn how to properly handle my anxiety."
6183,"I went to a therapist for a couple of sessions and she helped a lot, but now I feel like everything is out of control again and I don't think she can say any more to help me."
6184,I then went to my doctor and tried therapy.
6185,"So after a rough six months of panic attacks,anxiety,therapy,doctors and trying different meds I'm on a low dose of klodapin 0.5mg half pills twice a day and 10mg of paxil."
6186,"This is at a ""Christian-based"" counseling center where this doctor is the only true MD (the rest are therapists)."
6187,"From what several therapists have told me there, she is very strongly opposed to the stronger anxiolytics."
6188,"I've completed CBT already, but that was mainly for OCD intrusive thoughts, which actually through therapy, I discovered were mainly happening due to my suppression of my sexuality and so I do want to meet a guy badly."
6189,"So to skip ahead of all of the details, this week I have been rear-ended, my inlaws have yet to pay their part of the phone bill meaning my phone will get shut off, our basement has flooded twice, my husband and I are sick from mold exposure which the landlord said is impossible, I broke my phone, and my therapist appointment which I had scheduled later than she wanted has been canceled due to her being in the hospital (I can't hold it against her)."
6190,They told me you guys in this sub might be able to help me in general and also with finding a therapist.
6191,Should I go to my gyno or should I see a therapist or something.
6192,Basically the guy is dealing with a wife in depression who continues to occasionally try and ween herself off of medication without doctor/therapist interaction.
6193,It was like I forgot all the training I received from therapy.
6194,"I've seen a therapist about some family problems that have continued to happen, but I stopped seeing him a few months ago because he was supposed to give up his license for an unrelated matter."
6195,"I start listening to self-help books, see a therapist, start mindful meditation."
6196,"Since then I've seen a therapist a couple times which has helped me with my fear of going insane (which I think may one day drive me insane) and I have quit smoking everything (weed and cigarettes) for fear of what they will do to my rational mind and I feel like I have control over my thoughts again, which for those of you who have this type of issue know just how damn good that feels."
6197,"But now after doing therapy, we realized it was just the anxiety and depression coming on."
6198,I don't go to this therapist anymore because she started doing hypnosis and it did nothing for me.
6199,"I've started seeing a therapist last week and on the second month of taking pills, but I don't feel like I've gotten anywhere from the pills, I just feel worse."
6200,Would seeing a therapist help me?
6201,I have recently started seeing a therapist and got prescribed anti-depressants.
6202,"Did some time in therapy to deal with stuff, etc etc."
6203,I'm also having difficulties with my insurance and finding a therapist.
6204,It's taken me three weeks of back and forth with insurance and a couple of different therapists to figure out if I'd be covered just to learn they aren't taking new patients at this time.
6205,"I'd almost prefer a low dosage of some sort of medication to keep this in check as opposed to just being told to ""go see a therapist"", mostly because I'm afraid having that on my medical history could affect my firearm ownership or my chances of getting on a paid department."
6206,"Eventually the therapist in charge of his case is able to convince him that he is really a human being and is allowed to leave the hospital, he immediately comes back trembling."
6207,I haven't been able to see my therapist as much because of some issues with my insurance company not wanting to pay him so I've basically been on my own and it's been really difficult.
6208,6/21: Saw therapist.
6209,I'm going to get a better therapist lined up (thank god for health insurance).
6210,I started taking an SSRI and going to therapy sessions.
6211,I am going to start working with my therapist on this.. does anyone have any advice on stopping?
6212,After that I went through extensive therapy - EMDR - trying to deal with these issues.
6213,"I've been seeing a regular talk therapist for over a year, and I started taking a benzodiazipine a few weeks ago."
6214,I was diagnosed with PTSD and saw a therapist who really helped.
6215,"I don't want to talk to a therapist, I just want meds that will take away the constant fear and anxiousness so I can finally make it over the hurtle of talking to people who have always known me as someone who doesn't talk."
6216,"having the therapy over these years has given me a stubborn sense of hope, that this would be tamed and I could live hte life i wanted to."
6217,"I e tries legal and illegal drugs, lots of therapy, mental hospitals, 12 step programs..."
6218,"Apparently, he'd deluded himself into thinking that I was making him out to be a huge monster in therapy and blaming every problem I had on him."
6219,"Now that I'm seeing a new therapist, he's starting to do it again."
6220,"I noticed that it was progressively getting worse, so I decided that it was probably a good idea to go see a therapist."
6221,"Now, I've only been to therapy a couple times, but I have already been helped tremendously."
6222,The first is the top-down approach (most commonly used in cognitive therapy) which is essentially to learn to control your thoughts so that you can potentially control your physiological response to certain situations.
6223,The second way to minimize anxiety is through the bottom-up approach (commonly used in behavioral therapy).
6224,"If you are to combine the two approaches though (cognitive-behavioral therapy), the faults of each are suppressed."
6225,Final Note: Go to therapy.
6226,"My therapist prescribed me lexapro last week and I don't exactly know what to think about it, I have been prescribed Zoloft in the past, took one pill and felt deathly ill."
6227,I saw a therapist and through CBT &amp; talk therapy I was able to learn coping skills to control my anxiety.
6228,"I see a different therapist but initially started seeing her for depression, although she does treat anxiety as well."
6229,My therapy session is in a few days so I'll definitely bring this up with her.
6230,"I have been in therapy for about 7 years now, I do CBT with an OCD specialist."
6231,I have anxiety and depression disorder (I've never asked my old therapist exactly what she would classify me as) and lately it's taking a really bad turn.
6232,So they put me on some pills (that I still do take at a very low dosage) and I went on with therapy.
6233,"When I started therapy I was told I'd always have anxiety, and that's true."
6234,"Stuff my therapist tells me to control my anxiety works, but I still think the same shit all of the time and just get really frustrated that I turn my friends into things they aren't."
6235,I looked in the Yellow Pages and there's a single listing for a psychotherapist.
6236,"I mean, I *can* travel to the big city once a month or so, it's do-able but I thought therapy happened more often than that?"
6237,"I saw two therapists, and I upped my dosage from 20mg to 40mg."
6238,"It's something I've always tried to hide because my mom brushed it off when I was in middle school/high school, and mentioning therapy to her(I'm 23 but on her insurance) scares the hell out of her because I tried to kill myself a few years ago."
6239,"I am lucky to have a strong EAP program at work which we can find therapists through, and find resources."
6240,Should I volunteer to go to the therapist with her?
6241,I also missed both my psychiatrist appointment and my therapist appointment last week.
6242,"The day started off as usuall, feeling eh, had a therapy session squeezed in at 9 am suggested by my therapist."
6243,"I'm going to go see a therapist/psychiatrist tomorrow for the first time, I wasn't referred by a doctor which I know is the regular way but it was much easier (well assuming I actually do show up) setting it up that way."
6244,"I can't give up, not until I've given therapy a fair shake, I have to trust that it will help, that I'll find answers."
6245,Shes going to therapy with me tomorrow so hopefully I can show her this is real.
6246,"i haven't gotten a medical diagnose because my mom believes i can get over all of this by myself (i can, but therapy sounds way easier)."
6247,"Addition: I've been having thoughts of making certain life altering choices that I'm afraid to discuss with my therapist; not because I don't trust her, but because I'm afraid of being committed."
6248,"I’ve started seeing a therapist, but the advice he’s giving me doesn’t seem to be enough."
6249,I'm a week into cognitive behavioral therapy now and I'm trying to be open minded about it.
6250,"I'm doing much better with my anxiety, and I credit it to the techniques/information I've learned from here/therapy/the internet over the past few years."
6251,"I'm currently seeing a psychologist for therapy and a psychiatrist for meds, both of which think the best course of action is exposures, exposures, exposures."
6252,"Now I'm in therapy and taking medication, but I still feel totally incapable of making friends."
6253,"I'd talk to my therapist, but I can't get in until next week."
6254,"I am in therapy, and she thinks me going home or considering going back to Northern California is an avoidance thing."
6255,So I tell my new therapist all this and basically explain my whole life has been a balance of coping with fears and feeding off of accomplishments and acknowledgements.
6256,"I'm planning on finding a therapist to help with these problems, but have not done so yet."
6257,They're a nice resource for those of us who might not have access to therapy or who want to supplement our therapy with some peer support.
6258,"This week, there's either a massage therapist speaking or the moderator...can't remember."
6259,So after starting therapy a little over a month ago I found myself presented with a strategy of dealing with my anxiety that I never thought of before and I figured I'd share it with all you lovely people.
6260,The idea behind the whole thing according to my wonderful therapist is that to truly begin to face anxiety head on is that you have to know that it is a part of you and you should stop trying to fight yourself.
6261,I see a therapist regularly.
6262,"I am switching therpaists because my old therapist moved to a less than convenient location, and I'm seeing a doctor for psychiatric medications on Friday."
6263,My therapist told me I have generalized anxiety that stems from being over sensitive to how people think about me and putting too much pressure on myself to succeed in every task I do.
6264,I've already called a therapist to try to figure out what the fuck is going on and god damn is that not going to get here soon enough.
6265,"Near panic and hardly functioning, I called out sick and called my therapist and PCP hoping someone could give me something for sleep."
6266,My therapist can't see me for nearly two weeks.
6267,"Ive been to therapy, taken meds, read a bunch of self-help/anxiety/confidence stuff, and the conclusion is, I still feel like shit."
6268,"He's not on any medication, he's convinced all his anxiety/depression stems from withdrawal from being on klonopin for a little while, and he's not seeking therapy."
6269,"I met with a therapist yesterday (finally), and she gave me hope."
6270,I really want her to try CBT but she won't even admit she has a problem yet alone think about therapy...
6271,"I'm not sure what to do, all of the therapists I've called can't take on any new patients."
6272,"So, I've suffered from pretty moderate social anxiety my whole life but through visiting a therapist and taking zoloft every day it is much more under control now and I feel like I'm living a fairly fulfilling life."
6273,She's pretty granola so her help pretty much involves therapy and holistic medicine.
6274,I took this because I need to upgrade my high school courses to get into a respiratory therapy program so I can get out of being a transcriptionist (where I am fastly becoming a horrible employee due to boredom and general frustrations with the job).
6275,I'm getting therapy set up but I think I need something more right now to help me through this period.
6276,"A couple days ago my therapist sent in a prescription for 10 mg of celexa, insisting that it will really help me."
6277,"He sees a therapist and thats helped a bit with the anger, he has ways to cope most of the time."
6278,I know I should consider therapy but unfortunately I'm in the US without insurance and with thousands of dollars in medical debt already.
6279,my friend has severe anxiety that he takes medication for and goes to therapy for.
6280,"I've met with him twice and a few things kind of make me question myself:

* Talks a ton to explain his ideas and his approaches to therapy and why they work versus other approaches, but doesn't seem to put more of the focus on me (though to be fair, I talked a lot on the first day)
* Personal vice seems a little hypocritical (spouts being healthy, gluten-free, whatever, then has fast food bags in his trash)
* Each session is 45 minutes, and another patient is booked 5 - 10 min after (is this normal because it feels like very little time is given to my case?)"
6281,"Last night I had a really complicated and frustrating dream (I've been learning how to ""read"" my dreams in therapy) in which things I was looking forward to ended up going horribly wrong."
6282,"I am in therapy now, and I have been on Zoloft for a couple months."
6283,"My therapist told me that my anxiety is situational, and it's because of working in retail."
6284,And it shouldn't be a big deal to bring up because I honestly think therapy would be the best choice right now for me but I'm so scared of her taking it poorly.
6285,It's just hard to explain why it's important for her to know I want to start therapy.
6286,"I had a falling out with my therapist, and I couldn't get an appointment with a new one until Monday (a week from today)."
6287,"My former therapist was a psychoanalyst, and while it helped in the beginning, I really didn't learn any tools for coping with my anxiety."
6288,"The new therapist uses cognitive behavioral therapy, but obviously that's not helping me at the moment since I haven't actually seen her yet (and one session is obviously not going to fix this)."
6289,"So, r/anxiety, do you guys think that I'm biting off more than I can chew as someone who has severe social anxiety (I couldn't even order a pizza by phone at one time) or is this a clever way of self-administered exposure therapy?"
6290,"A month and a half ago I realized that I had to do something about it just to pull through the remaining year of studies, regardless of whether it would involve taking anti-depressants (my family has a strong bias against ""unnatural"" medications and a rampant fear of having an ""addict"" as a child so they are unlikely to pay for those) or going through therapy."
6291,"I didn't tell my psychiatrist the entire story but rather kept blabbering on and on about how I want to express my emotions more freely and be less afraid of judgement (because these two issues and a couple unfortunate accidents with women pushed me into therapy), but it's safe to assume that he got the idea of my state of mind."
6292,"It turned out that I don't have any particular disorder that I've been so desperately looking forward to be diagnosed with (you know, being pigeonholed and then given a failsafe solution to all my problems seemed very appealing to me), so he recommended that I try psychodynamic therapy to get my stuff together."
6293,There was a long break between the sessions at the very beginning of my therapy; coincidentally my procrastination was becoming unbearable and I was looking for ways to get things under control.
6294,The tears of joy I had on the next therapy session and a brief moment of hope were worth more than my entire life up to that point; feeling anything different from emptiness was a feat in itself.
6295,"It wasn't long until I delved into my past and it became a focal point in my therapy (which has actually helped me alleviate the burden of judgement and become honest with myself/my therapist), but things became awkward whenever I was asked to talk about my present."
6296,I want to be around people but I'm afraid of scaring them off with my unsubstantial problems and my overreaction to them so I end up having one or two awkward conversations with my best friends per week; at some point I even wanted to leave my therapist before she gets tired of my musings (but I realized that giving in to this urge would be plain unhelpful so we discussed it on another session).
6297,I keep fantasizing about having a time machine that I could jump into and fast-forward until the next therapy session.
6298,I need to somehow last through the holidays until the next therapy session and I'm in a lot of pain now.
6299,So I started seeing a therapist.
6300,I stopped seeing the therapist and things continued to go well.
6301,^where ^do ^therapists ^go ^when ^they ^are ^depressed?
6302,I've been keeping this all from my dad and I think I should call him tomorrow to tell him what happened and tell him I need to see a therapist to get help.
6303,"I'm also going to therapy so I don't think medication is the end-all cure, but I was wondering how much is a normal dose."
6304,"I went through so much in the past years, all the books I read on the subject, all the therapy, being off work for a while, I'm truly awake now."
6305,"I went to my therapist, I started medication, I started going to church, I started working out, I looked for support (online and family) and I completely cleaned out my room."
6306,"It's for that reason I can't go to a therapist, even though I know I really need to, since this is only getting worse."
6307,I am seeing a therapist regularly.
6308,I spoke to my therapist about this earlier in the week.
6309,The therapist told me to drive part of the way and see how it goes.
6310,"The therapist said if I feel panicky, pull over and calm down."
6311,I'm going to a therapist soon.
6312,"Inspired by positive response I saw to a thread on /r/depression where someone suggested 'speed dating' therapists and then choosing one based on that experience, I wanted to try an experiment where I set up these speed dating sessions for people based on some basic info they provide."
6313,"If you're currently looking for a therapist and interested in being a part of this, I'd love to hear thoughts."
6314,"I know he's not my therapist and he shouldn't have to be, but I wanted to be able to rely on him a little."
6315,I made some appointments to see a therapist and to get refills on medicine (something I've been forgetting to do for a while) and I was talking to him about it and I asked if in the future he would come with me to one of my therapy appointments so he could get a better understanding of what I'm dealing with.
6316,"I'm new to the whole therapy thing so maybe this was a universally bad idea and I was just stupid, but he got really mad."
6317,I can't afford therapy so anyone have any advice on how to deal with social anxiety without going to therapy?
6318,"I've had my preliminary diagnosis given few months ago, it's agoraphobia accompanied with panic attacks, going to therapy June 22nd."
6319,"**But a couple of years of therapy, medication and self-forced exposure therapy** and i'm a much more social and like able man."
6320,"**The important thing here is that I chose the therapy myself, there was nobody who forced it on me, I wanted to improve my life."
6321,"The panic attacks were what finally prompted me to see a therapist in January, and the therapist recommended I see a hormone specialist."
6322,"I've done countless hours of therapy, learned lots of great coping excersizes (breathing, relaxation) and have been able to start working a job again (since may!"
6323,"My psychologist proceeded to strongly recommend therapy for ""anxiety and depression""."
6324,"I am having trouble trying to find a therapist and the only place I have found lists ""cognitive therapy,"" among others, but not cognitive behavioral."
6325,i've read a few articles in the past referring to online therapy through Skype though i don't remember any leads.
6326,"It's handled (nothing's going out until monday), and I also have the added stress of today being my first therapy session to deal with about 24 years of rampant abuse and neglect so it's been a really long day."
6327,Freaked out post first ever therapy session and massive work-related email.
6328,"Long story short, I developed a severe anxiety and panic disorder at age 20, for which I sought treatment in therapy and medication."
6329,I say mild because I've never had a panic attack (but have gotten close) and also because I've never needed to see a therapist.
6330,Obviously if you have serious anxiety or compulsions you should see a therapist or doctor.
6331,I am currently seeing a therapist which is great but there are times where I just cannot quiet my mind.
6332,It is about using cognitive therapy for treating anxiety and panic attacks.
6333,"Cognitive therapy has been clinically proven to be as effective as medication for depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues."
6334,"The group that read a copy of ""Feeling Good"" while waiting for help got 20% better before they ever saw a therapist and even more impressive was that those gains were maintained even a year later."
6335,"At this point, I feel like I would benefit from therapy and possibly medication again (I've been medicated before) but in the act of trying to 'self-help' my way back to normalcy, I spent hours and hours obsessively reading about psychopaths and personality disorders on a website aimed at helping their victims."
6336,Now I don't want to see a therapist in case they diagnose me with some type of personality disorder because that sounds like a stigma people never ever get rid of.
6337,"I only started going to the doctors for intense pain in my jaw they even had no idea what was wrong with me I went for scans, physiotherapy,  painkillers then about a year in they and I finally realised it's anxiety causing me to clench my jaw day in and day out."
6338,"I have a psychotherapist I go to, and she recently suggest I take Venlafaxine 37,5 mg in the morning."
6339,"I have also been seeing a great therapist for the past year, seeing her does help but not enough to stop medication

My psychiatrist was resistant to put me on Xanax because it runs the risk of dependency, but now he won't take me off it even though it has done nothing for me."
6340,I do take anti depressants and I'm waiting to get therapy.
6341,I'm taking Wellbutrin and not currently seeing a therapist.
6342,"Also, I've been having some digestion problems since october, and I realized I didn't have them during winter holidays, I'm terrified of doctors and therapists and all that so yeah."
6343,I recently saw a therapist for the first time about my anxiety.
6344,"When I figured that out, I was able to take the leap from single therapy to group therapy."
6345,"That therapy doesn't count in the real world, and they only go there because their parent make them go there, they don't really look forward to being with me like I do to them."
6346,"I have my anxiety under control otherwise with a therapist and medication, and have for several months, but this is my first time dating since I got help."
6347,"It's interfering with my life again, and I won't see my therapist for another week yet...


**EDIT:** Thanks for your help everybody."
6348,"Hi - my therapist just recommended that I try using HeartMath, but it's really expensive."
6349,I'd like to tell all of this to a therapist or something.
6350,"A therapist isn't allowed to say that your problems are insignificant, even though mine are."
6351,My therapist asked to take this questionnaire that was 240 questions long and it evaluated my strengths and weaknesses to help her get to know my personality a bit more.
6352,"Then when I was diagnosed, I was getting help from a psychiatrist who got me addicted to medication (10mgs of ativan literally whenever I wanted so I took it like candy) and refused to get me actual therapy and refused to explain side effects, so I thought I was going psychotic when in actual fact the medication was making me hallucinate and totally fucking up my thought pattern."
6353,"Then they sent me to a psychiatric ward and I was able to leave after a year of absolutely no real therapy besides aforementioned medication on the condition that I go to retarded classes at my highschool, where I developed severe anxiety disorders from having to deal with being locked in a room with a retard banging on a door and screaming at me through the other side."
6354,"She was the only therapist that I could have ever said that actually helped me, and the only person I could say literally saved my life because if I didn't get help and was esnt to psychiatric ward after that I would have killed myself to cope with the sensory integration problems."
6355,"She is seeing a therapist once a month, but it doesn't really seem to help."
6356,"I started seeing a therapist a couple months ago and while it has been helpful, I am at the point where I am suffering."
6357,I talked to my therapist and I am going to set up an appointment with my family doctor to ask about medication.
6358,Years of therapy helped me learn that I've had this monkey on my back for far far too long.
6359,I have OCD which doesn't help things either and my therapist thinks I could have GAD aswell.
6360,She also encouraged me to see a therapist or counselor.
6361,"Anyways I told my mom that everything was looking good and that I was encouraged to see a therapist, but one: I'm not quite ready to talk to anyone about my problems and two: if I do decide to talk to someone I'll wait until the fall semester because it's free."
6362,"I plan on seeing and talking to my therapist about this, but I'm not sure when I'll be able to see her."
6363,"Though, it would be a lie to say that the most commonly said thing to me isn't ""relax Meg"") I had a therapist diagnose me with Social Anxiety while I was in high school, so I've had that kind of over my head for a while."
6364,My therapist often suggests weird things to me to try in an effort to resolve my issues.
6365,It is the only therapy she has suggested that I believe might have some efficacy.
6366,"I am thinking of leaving my therapist (who really doesn't seem to do much for me) for good and striking out on my own to take care of my issues, but before I do so I thought I would see if anyone has feedback on EMDR and whether it is just as easy to do on your own as in the presence of a therapist?"
6367,"I'm just coming to terms with the fact that I need help with anxiety/depression, and I'm planning on seeing a therapist next week, but for now I need some advice on how to cope in crowds - in particular in a restaurant."
6368,"So I've started back on prozac recently after 4 months having gone cold turkey, against advice of my therapist."
6369,I saw a triage therapist and saw her one time after our initial encounter.
6370,She recommended after the first session that I see a psychotherapist for medication.
6371,"Currently in between therapists (finding one this month), so I'm kind of on my own."
6372,"I HATE avoiding potentially contaminated foods, because I'm recovering from an eating disorder (therapist said it was like anorexia but not image based, more of a passive suicide attempt and a way to numb myself), and have really strong ocd with food."
6373,"I am seeing a therapists and bother her and my regular doctor have assured me that I show no signs of either, but of course that only keeps me cool for a while then it returns again."
6374,"To the different types of therapists - I absolutely hate the phrase ""on a scale of 1 to 10""."
6375,A week and a half ago I had the idea to give a call to my old therapist to see if he had any recommendations where I live.
6376,The therapist I connected with was very open ended.
6377,Is there a term I should be searching for that kind of therapy or related?
6378,"After three years of trying and failing to ask for help with my anxiety, I've finally decided to reach out to family, my boyfriend, and a therapist."
6379,I have only been medicated once and I decided to stop taking it because I felt I could be without it since I only took it 10days a month (around my menstrual cycle.. in high school I would have a panic attack the week prior to my period.. my therapist and I noticed the pattern.
6380,"God dammit, I know I'm gonna have to get into therapy again just to reverse the damage this is doing to my brain."
6381,Or get into therapy ASAP.
6382,"My parents were worried, they wanted me home and my therapist cautioned them and told them that I needed to have control and have some say in my life if I was going to get better."
6383,"Read many self help books, books on anxiety, been to doctors, used SSRI medication and gone to psychotherapy."
6384,"I'm in therapy now, and have recently started taking Zoloft."
6385,"Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I self harmed, saw three therapists and put on a lot of weight."
6386,"When I reached sixteen I gave up the self harming and the therapists deemed me ""cured."""
6387,"I've been 'diagnosed' by different therapists growing up with ocd, social anxiety and general anxiety/panic attacks."
6388,When I was a teenager my family tried to get me to take medication and keep me in therapy but I fought them most of the time.
6389,Years ago when I was in college I was diagnosed with social phobia and I took Paxil and Xanax and had a lot of therapy and things got real good.
6390,"So, due to my therapist's help, I have finally decided to move away from the city I've stuck myself in for 8 years."
6391,"He should be able to get unemployment, but my health insurance is through his job (my job's is trash and doesn't cover shit, AND is like twice the price as his) and I can't afford to see my therapist every twice a week like I do now, plus my medications."
6392,"I was really excited to start this drug, as it was highly recommended to me by my therapist."
6393,"On my last visit with my specialist (for juvenile arthritis), she told me that having anxiety like this is common in children suffering from a chronic illness, and suggested that I either see a therapist, or do some group-help program with other suffering patients."
6394,I am also seeing a therapist and feel better about approaching the issue like that.
6395,But at the same time I know taking the medicine would probably really help me academically for the next few weeks while therapy may take a while to have an effect.
6396,"I remember telling my therapist before all this happened, that I felt like when I make one mistake in life, It always ends up as some crazy domino effect where I just let everything else in my life fall apart."
6397,I've begged him to get to a therapist but he refuses claiming he went as a teen and it didn't fix him.
6398,"He will tell you therapist and psychiatrists are wastes of his time, they don't work."
6399,God I can't wait for my therapy appointment tomorrow and hopefully medication soon afterwards again.
6400,"Right now, I am struggling to get myself to use medication while going through therapy."
6401,"My therapist, and several doctors, have discussed short term medication as a possible solution to my problems."
6402,I recently told my parents about my anxiety and depression coming back and I actually saw my therapist today for the first time since january.
6403,I also have an appointment scheduled this friday with my doctor to possibly prescribe me something for my anxiety/depression (its what my therapist recommended).
6404,I just had my first therapy session with accelerated resolution therapy... and the results were phenomenal.
6405,"My therapist and I first talked about a source of my anxiety and a situation which I might have anxiety in, such as going to school."
6406,"I've gone to therapy before and have been disheartened by how little headway I made at just going once a week, but this was just instant and amazing."
6407,"They just ignored it and did an EKG and and Holter monitor and bloodwork (my thyroid is fine, it's been check 10000 times by now) , and tried to refer me to another therapist."
6408,I also started seeing a therapist yesterday and she told me I should start keeping a depression journal.
6409,In the end all they really did for me was set me up with a therapist and put me on a prescription for Vistaril.
6410,"I've been trying to find a therapist since his attempt, but I can't seem to find anyone that can see me in the next decade."
6411,I've asked my doctor and my therapist and they both say there is no connection...but I know there is.
6412,I have been in therapy off and on for about 20 years.
6413,"I have now found a therapist who actually has a clue, but unfortunately I can't afford her fees."
6414,"I would need a diagnostic report including:

* A specific diagnosis stating that I do have anxiety
* A description of current functional limitations
* Information regarding medication (none)
* Information regarding current treatment (will probably be only cognitive behavioral therapy)

Have any of you used your university’s disability accommodations and did they help you?"
6415,"They know the absolute bare minimum about my anxiety and depression, namely that I had it for some period of time two years ago, and the only reason they know that is because I failed two courses my sophomore year and back then they told me to get therapy."
6416,I think that this has convinced me that I do need to get a therapist.
6417,"I have a hard time talking about issues and getting personal with my friends, and with therapists, but maybe that needs to change if I can’t talk to my friends or family about my problems."
6418,Ten years of medication and therapy has done nothing.
6419,"I never went to therapy, and I've never been on any medications, I just... kind of dealt with it until I learned how to manage."
6420,"I've had a bad experience with a therapist and I'm still a bit wary, I think."
6421,"but I'm 19 and currently studying Autosport Development BENG, (UK degree) I'm also a long time sufferer from health anxiety about three years now for which I have seen CBT therapists and chose not to medicate."
6422,"No meds; started therapy for the first time a week ago) 

Hey everyone."
6423,"The cheapest out of pocket therapist I could find was $50 a session, which just isn't feasible."
6424,"And although I´d always feel better after the counselling sessions, I didn´t feel like my therapist truly understood what was happening to me."
6425,"Attempting to keep this brief, but I have generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder, and for the past four months I have been taking Effexor (75 mg) while seeing a therapist."
6426,"He's looking for a therapist to get help, and I think I'm starting to feel really good about that."
6427,I'm on a wait list for a therapist.
6428,Had one course of cbt a few years back but am not on medication or in therapy currently.
6429,Should I be trying harder to be referred to therapy or maybe see a different gp?
6430,"My mom stopped taking me to my therapist, even though it's just a 5 minute or so drive to there, so I'm thinking of having her re-schedule the appointments and just walking to them."
6431,I know I should see a therapist but I had to get this out first because idk why it's happening.
6432,"I tried psychiatry, psychology, various meds, until finally I found a combination of therapy and meds that worked."
6433,I commented on another thread about some mindfulness resources that a therapist recommended to me and another user suggested making a new thread.
6434,**Disclaimer: the resources listed here were at the recommendation of my therapist and some of my own research.
6435,"I would always suggest talking to a therapist of your own if you are skeptical (if anyone is in Charlotte, NC send me a PM and I can give you my therapist's info)."
6436,"I've been dealing with my general anxiety for quite some time, but I first started seeing a therapist to help about a year ago."
6437,I've talked about it with my therapist and she's been very encouraging and reminds me not to be discouraged and that this is something that I can do and just need to remind myself that I can.
6438,"Here is a list of things I have tried:
* Meditation
* Drugs
* Yoga
* Hypnotherapy
* Actual therapy: CBT, Mindfulness
* Antidepressants
* Exercise
* Eating healthy
* Having a journal
* Having a pet


I am so sick of trying new things all the time, I want the tightness in my chest to go away, I want the tummy aches to go away, I want to stop caring about what other people think of me, I want to figure out *why* this is happening, I want it to just stop please stop!!!"
6439,I never took medication or had a session with a therapist.
6440,Now I have some bouts of anxiety that have gotten better with therapy and positive thoughts but I am definitely not the person I was prior to two months ago.
6441,I've heard from my therapist and other sources that while having an anxiety/panic attack it is recommended to do some exercise.
6442,"i’ve been making lots of progress in therapy and i’m doing better with shit like keeping my room clean and staying sober, but at the same time i feel like i’m isolating myself more and more."
6443,"Hi,

So just for context, after a few years of therapy, I considered myself out of my social phobia."
6444,"Medication and therapy can help, yes, but FORGIVING ourselves can also help."
6445,I've given up looking for cures to the pain and panic attacks because no medicine or therapy works.
6446,I was pulled out of this hopeless situation in my teens and went through different therapies and foster homes.
6447,I already had lots of therapy in my life to help cope with a lot of things and I really want to try and solve this myself.
6448,"I already get psychiatrist appointments and they don't help at all, not even bothering with therapy."
6449,"I just want to note...

A. I know it is illegal to practice psychology or therapy without a license."
6450,Edit : Basically I am looking for less than a therapist but more than a friend to vent to.
6451,I'm going to try therapy again .
6452,"I'm starting to lose hope, I feel like the progress I made in therapy isn't going to stick, like I'll never be able to travel far with my friends, like I'll never be able to have a relationship and will die alone."
6453,My therapist just perscribed me 0.25 mg of Xanax 3 times a day.
6454,"In any case, I can't go see a doctor or a therapist anytime soon because I don't have a car and the closest one is about 10 miles away."
6455,I started back up in therapy and I can't connect to my therapist.
6456,"My therapist also called my parent to have them come in and talk about some of my issues and they said (very unhappily I might add) they will ""See when I can come in."""
6457,My therapist doesn't seem to take me seriously and is a little bit wacky.
6458,"I plan on looking for a therapist on Monday, but for the time being, I'm absolutely miserable."
6459,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
6460,And I'm trying to use some of the skills my therapist has taught me to help calm down and every time they start to work something else pops into my head to freak me out.
6461,"I keep on pushing to get a diagnosis but my mom says that I already have one; Aspergers Syndrome, that doesn't make me feel any better, I won't see my therapist until the 8th."
6462,I have been going to a new therapist ever since and have been undergoing very successful CBT and have been given over three weeks off work.
6463,However my therapy session was cancelled last week due to a family emergency the therapist was experiencing.
6464,"Been forcing myself awake at night for days as I keep having nightmares about this, I didn't realise how much I relied on my Wednesday therapy sessions and the centre still hasn't called me back to reschedule."
6465,"Another type of natural anxiety relief is to make aromatherapy such as adding critical oils to your bath, infusers, or massage oils."
6466,I'm in therapy now for anxiety and my therapist asked me if I could ask people in my surroundings to fill in a questionnaire.
6467,I've got both under control through the combined effects of lexapro and therapy.
6468,"Med student, very nervous when I go to study, in the past ive tried everything meditation, therapy and therapists, psychiatrists."
6469,"It is almost constantly busy with phones ringing every 2 minutes, people coming in to see the doctor and/or get physical therapy, and people coming in on official business (lawyers, attorneys, other doctors."
6470,"She had a very bad time at around age 12, hospitalised for two weeks at one stage, but things seemed to get better when she got medication and some therapy."
6471,They also don't have much money for expensive medication or therapy.
6472,"I'm 20, I dealt with pretty bad anxiety and depression throughout my teens but finally started getting control over it 2 or 3 years ago with the right combination of drugs and therapy."
6473,"I saw a therapist at my college (when I was in college), and while it was refreshing to have someone to talk to about it, my problem still exists."
6474,I went to A&amp;E and she said I had hyperventilation but that I needed to see a therapist about my anxiety.
6475,"Both have been getting progressively worse, and while I see a therapist, she's the only one for anxiety in my area, and as a result, when she cancels a single appointment, I go four months between seeing her."
6476,I'm really anxious about seeing my therapist tomorrow afternoon.
6477,"Finally after many, many, years I am seeing a therapist and will hopefully be subscribed something to help with my anxiety."
6478,"I know I should see a therapist and I plan on doing so when my money starts to come in, but only a week into a new job and I already feel like I have traded my life for money, with 4am starts and 8pm bedtimes, at the age of 21 I feel quite pessimistic for the first time in a good while."
6479,She's in therapy but her anxiety has prevented her from attending regularly.
6480,"Every time I go through some intensive therapy I feel like I am getting  better and have a better outlook and all that, but after some time it is like I start to wake up again and I'm make to 'reality'."
6481,I was prescribed by my GP and have therapy starting next week and my first appointment with a psychiatrist early next month.
6482,I have been seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist for a couple months.
6483,The medicine helps somewhat and the relaxation stuff my therapist has recommended helps a little but only short term (I feel better for an hour or so).
6484,I went to a therapist twice and was supposed to go yesterday but just didn't.
6485,"Medication, therapy, and I quit smoking pot."
6486,"I'm going to therapy, taking 40 mg of Citalopram, and I keep a log of my anxious feelings with my logical rebuttals next to them, but I still worry myself into depression often."
6487,My therapist suggested I ask for xanax but my doctor didn't want to give me something habit forming so gave me this instead.
6488,"I'm going to ask for her professional opinion on medication and therapy, particularly if he has any recommendations on someone he thinks can help me."
6489,"It started with statistics class and doing poorly on assignments and quizzes, and the levels of anxiety grew larger and larger until I couldn't take it anymore and went to see a therapist at my university."
6490,EDIT: Just wanted to note that I've seen a therapist before and plan on going to see one again soon.
6491,"My last therapist, who was wondeful, said that it could be a possibility that I fall somewhere on the autism spectrum."
6492,"I have been seeing my therapist for about 1 year, and he has been a steady advocate for me to write in a journal."
6493,My therapist was right.
6494,"I worked with therapy, I tried some drugs."
6495,"I started going to therapy for an hour every week, getting tips on mindfulness, meditation, exercising and did this for a year."
6496,"My second year in therapy I felt basically no better, I decided to try medication as well."
6497,This year I started my third year in therapy and I've been on Mirtazipine for a year.
6498,After only four weeks my therapist cut the cord and told me to go live my life.
6499,"I have anxiety and depression really bad, and recently I actually worked up the nerve to go to a therapist, but the appointment isn't until the 8th of April, and I seriously wonder if I will even make it until then."
6500,I finally got the courage to set up an appointment with a therapist to address my anxiety issues that have gradually been getting worse for the past months/year.
6501,I see the therapist in a few days but yesterday I feel like I hit a road block that has already digressed any potential progress I may have.
6502,"She keeps on but I honestly can't remember what is said and I finally start to leave the room and in my anger and panic I say, ""this is why I'm seeing a therapist."""
6503,I don't think I've ever been more ready to spill my heart and soul to a therapist because I desperately need her help right now.
6504,"Unfortunately that means I don't have spare cash to see say, a therapist (not that they've been especially helpful in the past anyway)."
6505,Not to mention I haven't even had the chance to look for a therapist.
6506,I do plan on finding a therapist soon.
6507,"I know therapy is needed but like I said, I can't afford it right now."
6508,I want to start therapy again but my schedule just doesn't allow for it.
6509,I wish I had a therapist but who the hell can afford that.
6510,"My therapist suggested that I never had ADD as a child, I was just anxious."
6511,"I have no confidence and hate the way my body is shaped and the way I look ( exercise does help...i'm not in bad shape....i just cant get over my body type and/or body conditions)....i have a psychiatrist, talk therapist, and have been to anxiety groups and group therapy...with the ladder especially helping because it shows that other people ( especially attractive women) are suffering in ways that i could never imagine."
6512,"Alas....group therapy only lasts for awhile until  you are processed and have to be let go ( in my case i was there for 1.5 years on a weekly basis)

Living with my mother ( since the day I was born) is horrible for my confidence...and I was recently close to moving out with a friend until he backed out recently."
6513,My therapist thinks a sexual surrogate or hooker isnt the worst idea for me actually...seeing as i'm terrrified of dating....but cautions me to see a cougar type who I wont get obsessed with..and that maybe i can glean some experience and/or confidence from.
6514,"My leasing company just contacted me and said that ""the insurance changed and now I need to get rid of the cat"" 

I'm just wondering if I register him now through my therapist, how do I go through the process and even, how do I tell my leasing company?"
6515,"I went to see a counsellor, but it seems as if my anxiety is persisting despite my therapy sessions."
6516,do I get personal in home therapy?
6517,"I kind of had it sprung on me, so I agreed to start, but after more thought and research, I feel like I can treat my issues herbally and with therapy."
6518,"Today my therapist said that I'm pretty much out of options, medication-wise, because I've tried everything."
6519,For these reasons I began therapy.
6520,"I can't remember exactly when it was that I started, but I began seeing a therapist somewhat regularly all the way through my sophomore year of high school."
6521,"They eventually came back, gradually consuming my life once more, but for one reason or another I had already stopped going to therapy at this time."
6522,"I'm trying to find a therapist I can go to more than once a month, but it's going very slowly."
6523,"Additionally, I have decided to take even more control and have decided to go back to therapy."
6524,"Some of the kids get lessons that are, more or less, equine therapy for them."
6525,"Today, honestly, was therapy for me that was effective in a way that pills and professionals are not."
6526,"I am in therapy, I am on meds, I try to eat right but I can't get any consistent rest, except on the weekends I sleep until 2:00 in the afternoon because of the depression."
6527,"Some lingering problems seem to have permanently raised my baseline anxiety, but therapy and medication have helped me keep moving forward."
6528,"It's taken me so much therapy and medication to get this far (applying for a job, getting an interview and accepting it) and I can't screw it up because financially I need this job."
6529,"because I'm just getting over a major clinical depression and anxiety episode that put me in the hospital I was stabilized and I'm medicated and seeing a therapist now and getting better

but ever since I my problems got really bad I haven't been able to draw anything I love drawing and I used to do it all the time but even now after I'm mostly recovered I can't see to draw anymore

I having ideas and things I wanna draw but every time I try my heart starts beating faster and I get all nervous and I either freeze up and can't start at all or start and quickly give up I don't know what to do"
6530,"Two things I've done since I was seven, yet still whenever I have ever sought help for anxiety, whether it be forums or expense therapists, all the advice seems to be a derivation of exercise or mediation."
6531,I will bring it up to my therapist tomorrow and may make an appointment with my doctor depending on how that goes.
6532,I am not sure how to present this to my therapist since we have been working on other things.
6533,I'm considering therapy.
6534,My therapist knows about these thoughts and I'm currently on 20 mg of celexa and she doesn't believe that it's ocd and more intrusive thoughts.
6535,I went to therapy for a few months but it felt like it did nothing for me.
6536,Try therapy again?
6537,I called a therapist the next day and met with this great man who I felt really got was going on and now I'm starting a path of cognitive behavioral therapy to really get to the source of what's happening.
6538,I feel good about the recent changes in my life and think this therapy will help.
6539,"I tried talking with my dad about visiting someone to help me with my anxiety, but he said that I dont need anyone, but if I still feel so anxious for more than 2-3 months, then maybe we are going to a therapist (or idk how its correctly named, my english is pretty bad)."
6540,I've been seeing a therapist for a while and its been helpful but I don't know how to handle this.
6541,He suggested couple therapy but I don't see how that can help.
6542,So the biggest part of this is exposure therapy to needles.
6543,I'm seeing my therapist tomorrow and I know she'll be so excited for me too.
6544,"I have seen therapists, but they have not been of much help."
6545,I've talked with a therapist about this but it's gotten worse since I last met with her a week and a half ago.
6546,"I tried everything, really, everything, and the things I would like to get everyone to do, for it helped me, at least, are:

* [EMDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing)
* go see a therapist
* start grinning."
6547,"I recently put together a mind/body calmer for clients, I'm a licensed therapist and counselor in practice."
6548,EDIT: I am seeing a therapist at my universities Psychological counseling center next week.
6549,"To any wondering if she is seeking therapy..yes, she is."
6550,"The kind doctor explained to me what happened, and they let me talk to a therapist for an hour, free of charge, and he explained to me what anxiety was and how it happens."
6551,"By the end of high school my anxiety reached the point that it became a serious problem and I received some counseling, exposure therapy, and medication."
6552,"My therapist has taught me some methods of calming myself down, but here's something that I came up with by myself:  When I'm stressed out, I think about someone that I love and trust, usually my boyfriend, and I imagine them comforting me."
6553,"In the past I had rather severe anxiety problems (GAD), thanks to therapy they're now on a quite manageable level though."
6554,I'm starting therapy again soon but wanted to get some help before then.
6555,"I can handle it better having gone through therapy, but I am now bouncing between worrying about having several different diseases (i.e."
6556,I mentioned it in my group CBT class last fall and the therapist just gave tips on how to deal with anxiety at night (which is understandable and well-appreciated).
6557,Was able to get myself into therapy finally.
6558,So far therapy hasn't helped at all.
6559,I'm kind of wondering what I do next if therapy isn't working and medication isn't working.
6560,"I looked into seeing a therapist, but got panicky before I met with her."
6561,"I did it, she said I needed to see a hypnotherapist because she was not the right person that could help me."
6562,He suggested to see a therapist and gave me a contact at a mental health and addiction clinic.
6563,I saw a therapist although it made me so anxious.
6564,I now work at a chapters and have missed 2 sessions with my therapist and it's been almost a month since I last saw her.
6565,"One thing that's disappointing to me, is that back in the days when I had severe anxiety (no longer), therapists attitudes would basically be ""you have it, deal with it""."
6566,"But a lot of therapists often give you this strange look if you ask them if your anxiety can be ""cured""."
6567,I don't like how therapists just like to throw terms at you but few of them seem to give you anything truly practical for you to practice to help stave off anxiety attacks.
6568,I'm seeing a therapist for the first time soon.
6569,I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to approach talking about medication with a therapist.
6570,"Title pretty much clears everything up - I'm 17, I don't like the sound of any medication that people take and I don't know where to start with therapy."
6571,"I'm 23f and not on any meds (probably should be, but afraid of approaching therapist)."
6572,Do therapists take this kind of anxiety seriously?
6573,I see a therapist every few weeks but I'm probably going to make it every week or so if this keeps up.
6574,"This is going to be long because I don't feel like I really have anyone to lean on for this stuff (and yes, I know therapy is helpful."
6575,My therapist told me at my appointment last week that I was going to be prescribed hydroxyzine and xanax very soon for my anxiety.
6576,I seek therapy when I can afford it but even there I feel like what I share (or what I want to share) is always along the lines of the same thing... my continued struggle to pull out of this state.
6577,Sometimes when I go to therapy I feel so guilty that I pretend that I've made progress and put on a face because I'm afraid my therapist will lose hope in me.
6578,"I saw a therapist for awhile, but stopped after my mother asked me if I wanted to go anymore (I thought that I was done)."
6579,"I have been in therapy and worked through CBT and DBT and da da da techniques, and maybe I just suck at them, but they don't help."
6580,"Therapy has never helped and I am moving in about six months and don't want to get involved with a new therapist now, if ever (I hate therapy, either I've had a string of awful therapists or it just makes things worse)."
6581,"I had anxiety when it came to therapy, where I would **deliberately leave out important details that would be difficult for me to say out loud** and said I felt fine when I knew that I wasn't."
6582,I am definitely seeking help at the moment looking for some therapist.
6583,"I don't want to tell my therapist, because our sessions right now are biweekly and relatively stress-free, and I feel like having actual issues to talk about would make them really heavy (and would also likely cause him to increase to 2 or 3 times a week)."
6584,I'm on my thirteenth day of celexa and Thursday will be my third session of cognitive behavioral therapy.
6585,Shes convinced that I dont really have an anxiety disorder and it was all placed in my head by my therapist.
6586,"I have a therapist now, but trying to cope with anxiety alone makes it way harder."
6587,"I'm unmedicated, and I've had a lapse in my therapy sessions, which I know isn't the best for me."
6588,"I fully intend on attending therapy again, but medication is something I would rather stay away from since I had a bad experience in the past that I would rather not elaborate on."
6589,"My question is, has anyone gone to therapy to root out the exact cause of all this?"
6590,"I've already tried therapy a few times (around 1 year each time), and I just want to function normally again."
6591,"I've been slowly working at exposure therapy for months now, and I have had plenty more bad days than good days."
6592,"I would be interested in continuing to see a counselor, therapist, or psychologist, but unless these are provided for free through the school I'm unable to afford it."
6593,"Hi, I am always anxious, and somehow it got worse in recent months, but I am seeing a therapist, and thinking about the right way for me to get over my anxiety a lot."
6594,"I want his life to be better, but unfortunately I don't have the means to help him out with therapy or anything like that."
6595,I don't have a therapist on this because it's hard to afford that.
6596,I recently got in touch with a new therapist (my old one left the state about a month ago) but we won't have a real appointment until 2 weeks from now.
6597,I've seen lord knows how many therapists/counsellors to no avail.
6598,i've gone to therapy throughout middle school and high school but ive never been diagnosed with any sort of disorder.
6599,"As therapy is not an option at the moment (can't afford private treatment, and NHS waiting lists for mental health services in my area are very long), I feel like I have no one to talk to about this or any sort of way I can get advice."
6600,"I agree that therapy is a good step, and worked OK for her depression, but unfortunately my significant other has a fear of doctors, so getting her to go to therapy for anxiety is somewhat of a catch-22 situation."
6601,"He is on medication and seeing a therapist but it doesn't seem to be helping, especially since he's been missing a lot of appointments lately, which I know is connected to the anxiety."
6602,I'm going to see a CBT therapist tomorrow and get evaluated.
6603,I was in therapy from April to October but I quit because of a fight I got in with my therapist.
6604,"In early high school I went through a program that involved both individual and group therapy, which did not help."
6605,"Later in high school and early in college I saw another therapist for more than a year, who prescribed Lexapro and Buspar, neither of which helped, and one of which (not sure) gave me suicidal thoughts and I've never taken either since."
6606,"After unsuccessful attempts with both therapy and medication, and being in a place where I was satisfied with the way my life was going, I had resolved myself to just roll with the punches and live with my anxiety and hope for the best."
6607,Do people have any success stories to share about anxiety/depression and how counseling/therapy helped?
6608,"I started therapy 4 months ago, and the last month was great, I was calm, hopeful, thinking I was going to be free from my saboteur."
6609,"I'm fine, my therapist said I'm getting better, was it a lie?"
6610,"I called my therapist and said what happened, she told me it's normal, I pushed myself into a stressful situation."
6611,My therapist suggested I try a few and see how it goes.
6612,I have no therapist as the last one I had left me.
6613,So I've been in therapy and on Zoloft for a while now with no results so far.
6614,"I went back yesterday and was told they were looking into a ""partial hospitalization program"" that would involve me going on disability for 8 weeks while undergoing intense treatment (benzos + therapy) for 6 hours a day, five days per week."
6615,"I'm being treated for an eating disorder, too (EDNOS) and my therapist feels like I would benefit from drug therapy as my anxiety is a driving factor behind my eating behaviors."
6616,How did you decide whether or not to use drug therapies?
6617,TL;DR: Trying to decide whether to use SSRI's or continue CBT/talk therapy.
6618,"I have undergone 3 different therapies, none of which really helped, yesterday I went to the psychiatric emergency room due to chronic fear and trouble sleeping."
6619,I can't really access therapy and it turns out I'm allergic to the medication my doctor prescribed me.
6620,"**tldr**; i'm a 19 year old, genderqueer person in the USA without access to therapy/medication who can't get any sleep because of my anxiety - i'm wondering what you guys have done to help yourselves and what your experiences have been like."
6621,"I've been really proactive as far as dealing with it- reading lots of books, going to groups, using CBT techniques, therapist, medication, journaling, etc."
6622,Around this time I began seeing a therapist and a couple years later I began meds.
6623,I don’t take meds nor do I see a therapist.
6624,"Meds are a last resort for me, and I just started seeing a therapist today."
6625,"One, I heard water therapy is good."
6626,"I've tried to get a therapist appointment, but I live in a small town, and there aren't any free session times for ages."
6627,"He is thinking about going to therapy, which he apparently has always refused to do in the past."
6628,The idea would be that his main contribution to the wedding would be to go to therapy to be in as good a state of mind as he can be for the wedding.
6629,How does one go about finding a good therapist?
6630,"Been through DP/DR and PD, but I've cut most of it out through CBT, meditation and hynotherapy, I rarely get it now."
6631,"I've thrown away my weed, I'm trying to sort out therapy and hoping to get started soon but it just feels like too little too late."
6632,Should I call a therapist?
6633,"Background: About 3 years ago, after having done talk therapy and some behavorial stuff, I experienced a terrible weekend that was, essentially, a 48 hour anxiety attack."
6634,"I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, for which I have seen several different therapists and spent most of that time taking lexapro."
6635,"I am trying to deal with all of this through therapy, medication, talking to friends, meditating, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and exercising."
6636,I see a therapist now but i'd like some tips from other sufferers if possible.
6637,I've been in therapy for a few years.
6638,"The therapy is helpful, but I feel like I need more."
6639,"So I started seeing a therapist, and figured we would talk things through."
6640,"I've done some research on anxiety disorders and exposure therapy (if you haven't researched exposure therapy and you're a sufferer of any type of anxiety disorder, even OCD, then RESEARCH IT)

but yeah: for pretty much my entire life I've had a huge anxiety problem/ panic attacks related to bodily functions, and have been unable to say ""bless you"" after someone sneezes because the initial panic of hearing a sneeze is so powerful that I can't seem to calm down quick enough to say ""bless you"" without the silence between the sneeze and the ""bless you"" becoming awkward."
6641,"anyway,
I've been trying exposure therapy (like forcing myself to say ""bless you"" to people I'm comfortable with) and today I managed to say ""bless you"" to a loud-sneezing colleague loud enough for her to hear it two desks away."
6642,So i met with my therapist yesterday and I was discussing a sequence of events that took place over the weekend.
6643,"My therapist had to cut our session short because of an emergency that was taking place with another patient, but before I left she mentioned we'll work on how to avoid ruminating thoughts."
6644,"So I recently started going to therapy, it only took two years to muster up the courage to call one, and it's been great."
6645,"I have found a wonderful therapist that I get along with very well and honestly being able to talk about your anxiety with another person is extremely helpful, in my case at least."
6646,"I thought I was going to be stuck like this forever but thanks to you wonderful people, your advice, my therapist, and initiative, I finally feel like I'm working towards positive change!"
6647,So that's why i'm doing therapy and taking the meds.
6648,"hi /r/anxiety

when i say i don't know if therapy is helping, what i really mean is that i don't know if the therapist i'm seeing in particular or his approach is helping."
6649,i've been seeing a therapist weekly for a month now.
6650,i know i shouldn't expect any instant change or anything like that but i also feel like i only feel worse than i did before i started therapy.
6651,my therapist keeps telling me about how i need to experience my emotions rather than fight against them but everything i do feels like a constant fight against them.
6652,but it just feels like my therapist is saying the same words over and over while my eyes cry and cry and cry.
6653,should i look for a new therapist?
6654,"i saw some of the posts here talking about medication but my therapist has never mentioned it except in the first visit, and i don't want to bring it up because i feel like i don't know whether i really ""need"" them or not."
6655,"I started seeing a therapist, but he hasn't said much lately..."
6656,"Oh, and I've been in therapy since I was 4."
6657,I'm hoping to start therapy up again once everything else is settled.
6658,My therapist said I didn't even need therapy anymore.
6659,I didn't even know I was having panic attacks until I was talking to my mom's friend (who happens to be a therapist) and she was talking about panic attacks.
6660,I do go to a therapist but not for another 2 weeks.
6661,"(There's mild Autism, Bipolar Disorder, Social Anxiety, Eating Disorder) I'm working with a therapist to work through these, but in the meantime, is there like a step-by-step process to learn how to connect with other people again?"
6662,I've started cognitive behavioural therapy and I'm off to a great start but a really funny thing happened the other day.
6663,I have also seen a therapist but found it very difficult to open up to her as she seemed to treat my form of self harm (excessively scratching my wrists) as a terrible thing to do which really freaked me out.
6664,"so I've always had extreme issues with hypochondria , but the only other time it's been this bad was when I was convinced that my appendix was bursting on the daily when I was 10, i had to go to therapy for that and for a while it was okay."
6665,So I really don't want to go back to therapy for this again but I'm running out of things to occupy my mind.
6666,"I'm going to schedule an appointment fairly soon, and I'm not sure if I should ask the doctor for something for anxiety or see a therapist (I'm going to do this either way) instead, considering my benzo abuse is in the records now."
6667,"So I had kind of a break down today in front of my parents but they're going to help me see a therapist finally... as I was talking to my dad though, he was saying how my best friend isnt good for me, and I know she isnt."
6668,"My coping skills have gotten so bad that last week I tried to check myself into an inpatient facility but they basically said that even though I'm pretty much not able to function or even leave the house, that I didn't fit the criteria for inpatient therapy (aka I'm not a danger to myself or others so my lousy insurance wouldn't cover it) I'm just feeling very lost and confused and hoping some people on this forum can empathize with my situation and offer some sort of advice."
6669,"However, now that I've got therapy I've been really great."
6670,"Anyway, my therapist really helped me become more aware of how big of a problem my anxiety had become."
6671,"I am writing this in order to find some much wanted solidarity not so much in my condition itself, but the way I react to the thought of going through therapy.."
6672,"I will be starting on one soon and these are my questions, if you care to answer them:

1) My biggest fear/turnoff concerning therapy is that it simply won't work."
6673,"Because it happens often that I am quick to flip an issue and think about the other possibility, just when I think about how easy some task (that in my anxiety seems to be insurmountable) is and think all the right, positive, motivating thoughts, then I am, perhaps out of the force of habit, very quick to think about the negative side... 

2) Even if some kind of therapy, like CBT, will teach me how to produce productive thoughts patterns, how can I make sure that a motivational/productive thought is going to last longer than the time I am actively thinking it?"
6674,There are many posters in the anxiety subreddit who could HUGELY benefit from seeing a time line therapy practitioner.
6675,I've been trained in NLP and time line therapy for 2 months now and i have seen anxiety in all my clients reduced or gone completely within on average one to two sessions and not more than 3.
6676,"I haven't managed to find a single post about time line therapy so I believe it is important to share this, especially with those who have things like social anxiety, panic disorder, etc ...

Time line therapy works by clearing negatively impacting emotions from the subconscious mind such as anger, sadness, fear, hurt and guilt and then has a model specifically designed for tackling anxiety."
6677,"I do exercise, practice yoga, and I am seeing a therapist, I know those are ""behavioral"" things a lot of people (including doctors) suggest."
6678,Every therapist I've seen has gotten REALLY annoyed with my pessimism.
6679,I start exposure therapy this week but what else can be done when I steal have the irrational fear that something is wrong with me and think I'm dying every time I feel a palp.
6680,"I can't even talk to him about my anxiety/depression, because he'll just dryly say ""go see a therapist"", with no sympathy or understanding."
6681,"He and I tried group therapy a few years ago after the divorce, and it kinda worked, he stopped doing some of the more intrusive/rude things he used to do, and that was only after the therapist made it blatantly clear to him that no, he was not acting like a reasonable person."
6682,"I do see a therapist once a week but sometimes the thoughts creep in deep and I feel just unworthy...and helpless but something deep inside says ""one day you will be worthy"".."
6683,"After some intensive therapy and lots of support, I feel better."
6684,"I have been to about eight therapists in my short life, I have tried two medications, the meditation thing, working out, breaking things, basically everything to stop this kind of reaction when people get mad or yell but nothing works."
6685,"I'm going to give this verbatim to my therapist, and I'm wondering if any of you have the same things happen."
6686,"I went to therapists for years, finally found someone good that I adored, but she left the practice since she had a kid."
6687,"Things I tried to help it:
therapy - couple different therapists, and I think they were nearly useless
medication - got on lexapro 5 mg and still am on it
exercise -  started working out, especially lifting weights 
supplements - vitamin D 5000mg daily,  fish oil supplement 
meditation - all based on Jon Kabat Zinn's audiobook recording of ""Wherever You Go, There You Are""


My improvement was painstakingly gradual."
6688,It’s like unraveling a web now that I’ve finally started to see a therapist.
6689,I’ve seen my therapist six times now.
6690,"Nowadays, most health insurance covers therapy 80/20 after the deductible is met."
6691,"As stubborn and independent as I am, if I can finally enter therapy after 20 years of dealing with it on my own, then you probably can, too."
6692,"For the first time in my life, I reached out to my father who has always thought I was just lazy and had no desire to do anything, I tried my best to explain to him what I am going through, I don't think he understood completely but he wanted to help and suggested that we go to a therapist."
6693,"I've never been to therapy or seen a doctor about it, I mostly keep it to myself because I don't think anyone would believe me."
6694,So I've been seeing this therapist for a while now.
6695,I was handed a paper with a list of her recommended therapists in my area.
6696,"Most of which don't accept my insurance (two of the therapists did, but they were guys and that did not make me comfortable in any way)."
6697,"As of yesterday, I don't have a therapist."
6698,"I can't have ""Skype sessions"" with her; she's not being reestablished as a therapist for months after she moves and even then she's not open to the idea."
6699,There aren't any female therapists in my area that accept my insurance.
6700,"I've been in therapy since January 2015 to figure out my PTSD from emotional trauma as a child, anxiety, depression and my struggles with relationships(friendly, romantic, parental, family)."
6701,I talked to my therapist today about that very thing and she wonders if I am creating/manifesting a phobia about dating.
6702,"A lot of my life, I have felt that I have been in a fog and coming out of it thanks to medication and therapy."
6703,"My therapist has given me many ways of coping, but I really can't seem to overcome the mutism which I feel I really need to do to be able to be helped through my attacks."
6704,"I did a map with my therapist (I'm in the early sessions of CBT) where you do thoughts, physical symptoms, behaviours and emotions, and I literally cannot write anything in the emotion box."
6705,"Been to numerous psychologists, psychiatrist, and therapists."
6706,"I've been in therapy for it but, of course, the therapist can't make reality go away."
6707,And I'm optimistic because I had asked him to see a therapist (I see one too) and he actually did it.
6708,"I've never really voiced out my anxiety/depression in any way besides therapy, so this is new to me."
6709,Is there any way I can get some type of therapy for free?
6710,"After reading some posts, I started to look for a therapist."
6711,I think it might've started when I emailed a couple of therapists to ask them for a consultation and began to think way too much about what would happen if I were to go to a session.
6712,This last year has been the worst so within the last few months I started therapy and got Xanax.
6713,Hi guys - anyone feels like sharing some success stories about seeking help and going to therapy?
6714,"I, for one, am very curious about CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy)..."
6715,"And, to head off the questions I'm expecting, he is medicated for his anxiety, although I don't believe he's working with a counsellor / therapist."
6716,Should I see a therapist or something?
6717,I visit a therapist a few times a month and he has been very helpful.
6718,"it took me to go see a therapist what was really wrong with me, ive always had depression, but im a rather positive person, even with these drawbacks, i geuss the worse thing about it is it trick your mind so much that danger seems real, its truely amazing if you think about it, im far from 100 percent, but im working on it, im currently on no meds, its hell but im trying to overcome things naturally, the only meds i take is for blood preassure, but its only because my family is very rpone to high hp, and mine has been perfect for a long time, and physically im am as helathy as i can possibly be, dont smoke or do drugs and drink very little, i wanted to give anyone going through the samething advice."
6719,I've been seeing my therapist for almost one year....talk therapy has helped me so much..but my therapist has suggested anxiety medication.
6720,"Background info on my anxiety:
While in therapy I found out I had generalized anxiety disorder....which I figured out had been with me since childhood...I never knew how to describe it until this past year."
6721,"Hi, I should say first that I have been diagnosed with moderate to severe depression and anxiety and I have been seeing a therapist for some months but it isn't really doing anything for me."
6722,Do you have to see a counseller/therapist before being perscribed?
6723,I was in therapy at the time and it was recommended by my therapist.
6724,"My insurance stopped reimbursing the therapy, so my therapist, doctor, and I all agreed the SSRI would be the best route to go."
6725,I never got much from therapy personally other than breathing techniques and learning to separate perceived threats from actual threats.
6726,I had gone to therapy and was on meds when I was a pre teen after my parents divorce in 2002.
6727,"I have already had a session with my therapist, he doesn't prescribe meds and said that I would have to make an appointment with my regular doctor."
6728,"I plan too very soon, I just have to get in touch with my insurance and my therapist thinks I should certainly get checked out and that I suffer from some form of anxiety."
6729,My depression came back and I was put into therapy by my doctor.
6730,I just want to share my experience and see if anyone is dealing with the same thing because my therapist said my racing thoughts are directly related to the insane amounts of anxiety I have been feeling.
6731,This is the first time I really spoke to anyone about this other than my therapist and I feel like she doesn't even understand what I mean when I talk about it.
6732,All I can find on anxiety websites is directories of therapists.
6733,"In general, my anxiety has been under control through the combination of therapy and medication, but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this sort of thing."
6734,"**Anyways, what are your opinions/recommendations for cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety and panic attacks?"
6735,"**

My doctors in the past and currently have only prescribed drug after drug without much recommendation of a two-pronged approach: drugs and therapy."
6736,I was thinking about venturing into CBT by myself or finding a counselor to help me with therapy.
6737,I hating being like this so I saw a therapist who claimed it was the ADD causing me to act this way.
6738,I didnt have insurance and I couldnt afford to keep up appearances with the therapist or dr or meds so I stopped going.
6739,"I've tried therapy for years, many different meds, and now all I have is Xanax which helps at least prevent panic attacks (but my lovely doctor wants me off them cause it's not ""long term"" but doesn't have me on anything else, so I'm starting to get worse again and he don't seem to care)."
6740,"Listening to stop worrying tapes and lectures, meds, therapy (had to stop, new insurance has a 30 co pay and that, on top of dr visits, just isnt affordable to me), hypnosis, the whole mirror thing (both positive and negative attempts to convince myself), motivational post-its, and so on."
6741,What has helped all of you in terms of supplements and natural therapies?
6742,I recently saw a therapist last year during a time where I had mild anxiety while gearing up to make a decision of whether or not to move to South America.
6743,I remember most of the therapists I contacted before had a long wait period (3-6 months).
6744,I have tried several therapists.
6745,"I have studied my anxiety extensively, and I haven't found a therapist yet who has told me anything I wasn't aware of."
6746,I've never had therapy and I don't know much about how it might work or what the best way to describe my anxiety is.
6747,"Fourth, if you are not already, talk to a therapist."
6748,So I've been to two different therapists.
6749,I feel like the therapist is judging me or something.
6750,It's not just the therapist though.
6751,"TL:DR Literally can't talk to people, not even therapists, family, or friends."
6752,"My therapist, who i value dearly and i have just now got comfortable with after several months is retiring in may."
6753,"Horror stories come with every type of medication or therapy, and in the new age of conspiracy medical faults turn into diabolical schemes."
6754,"I am in therapy, but I do not yet have the tools at my disposal to fight health anxiety panic attacks."
6755,"I just saw a therapist for the first time, and they suggested that I get back on medication for my anxiety."
6756,"Her sister is a therapist with her doctorate in psychology, but Cora won't open up to her despite being close."
6757,"I told her that I was already going to therapy (that was a lie) and that I was doing my best to live with my anxiety (not really a lie), so if she could let me work at my own pace and not put me on the spot every stinking day that would be great."
6758,"I recently talked to my parents about going to therapy, and they said yes and didn't make me elaborate on why, which is fantastic because I didn't want to say."
6759,"I would like my teachers to be understanding about what I'm going through, but I feel like they aren't going to listen to me unless I shove a diagnosis in their face, and I don't want to go through therapy during school even though that's probably where it would help me most."
6760,Am I making things too hard by limiting myself to a psychiatrist as opposed to a psychotherapist or something?
6761,"I'm looking for help with my anxiety, but I can't seem to understand this concept of having a ""connection"" with a therapist."
6762,Why does the same not apply to therapists?
6763,"I had my first therapy appointment yesterday, and it didn't go very well."
6764,I'm hoping they will also be able to make a recommendation to me as far as other therapists.
6765,"Last week I had my first visit with my new therapist and I'm having a dilemma... 
My old therapist told me that the first thing she does when she starts seeing someone new is tell them to stop taking anxiety medication."
6766,I've never taken any so that wasn't an issue- but my new therapist is strongly recommending that I take some.
6767,After writing this I called my insurance company for suggested therapists/psychiatrists.
6768,"I need help but can't get it, as I got thrown out of group therapy because I couldn't do the 2 hour sessions they wanted me to do."
6769,"I told them I wanted solo therapy and they told me that it will start ""sometime after the summer"", which could be in 2016 when it comes to Swedish hospitals."
6770,There seems to be a split on this forum between people who understand that there are successful therapy modalities for anxiety and those who either do not understand or think that they are different - that they have a type of anxiety or mind that cannot respond to treatment.
6771,"It seems, however, to depend on the ability of the individual therapist to use it well."
6772,"I know from personal experience, as well, that CBT is a rather involved process that requires good direction from your therapist, and a bad therapist can get hung up and be unable to modify the approach slightly."
6773,"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20599133


Having gone through CBT with two therapists and by using a helpful book, and reading portions of a training manual and textbook, I have a decent handle on it, although I am not a therapist and cannot claim to be able to cure anyone."
6774,"Sorry about the rant, I'm just upset at the lack of individual oriented therapy."
6775,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
6776,My therapist recommended a 504 plan for my anxiety (GAD) at school.
6777,"He gave meds a very brief try, same with therapy, said they did not help and were expensive."
6778,I went to therapy for about a year last year which didn't seem to help.
6779,"I was doing so well that my therapist decided last week to leave a month until the next session, which I had no problem with at all."
6780,I got so bad that I had to phone my therapist at school to ask for advice.
6781,I have this idea of how I talk to the therapist and she gets angry and then tells me I am wasting her time and I don't deserve a place in therapy.
6782,How was your first time in therapy?
6783,"I have been seeing a therapist since January now, I told her on Monday about everything, I don't see her til next week."
6784,All that I know about therapy sessions is what I see from tv/movies.
6785,"About 2 years ago, when I had what could only be categorized as a breakdown, or a massive anxiety attack, I went to see a therapist."
6786,"I have a therapist that I've been visiting for free at the uni but it's not been working for me neither, most of the things that I'm told I already know because I spend lots of time on the internet researching information about mental diseases and trying to figure out what is wrong with me, sometimes I don't even know if there's something wrong with me and I wonder if I'm just trying to find a justification for my lack of motivation, laziness, unhappiness and so on."
6787,"Over the years Iv seen numerous Councillors, Iv had cognitive therapy, It tried herbal remedies and I've been on Prozac."
6788,"None of those things have really worked and now I am 19 years old, I am on no medication, I have no therapy and I feel completely lost."
6789,"For those of you who don't know what IEP's are- basically when your child has special needs they have a team of specialists evaluate your child, make academic/therapy goals and a curriculum based of their specific needs."
6790,"I'm stuck in a small room of therapists, the ESE director, his teacher, and we have to review this big packet and rewrite his new goals."
6791,"Hello, I have pretty bad anxiety, went to a therapist for a while and was told it is just generalized anxiety disorder and if it isn't stopping my day to day activities then it is controlled."
6792,"&amp;nbsp;

A year ago I started my first project about nano medicine in chemo therapy and it turned out to be really stressfull."
6793,She's taken me to three therapists total over the past few years.
6794,"All my therapist really does is say the same thing over and over, about how I have to step outside my comfort zone."
6795,I have talked to at least 6 therapists with no avail.
6796,"Between that and the yoga suggested by my therapist, I was starting to do ok.

Well..."
6797,I started therapy a few months ago but can only afford to go once every two weeks.
6798,I'm having a really difficult time opening up during therapy and I feel like this is really slowing things down.
6799,"Due to financial reasons, he has been without therapy ~2 months."
6800,"At the moment, it looks like he won't be able to restart therapy for another month (we're moving in about a week)."
6801,"I KNOW the answer is therapy and medication, but that's not doable right now."
6802,"The programme will be a mix of talk therapy, group therapy, doctor visits, ergotheraphy, sports etc."
6803,"(And apparently this is a totally normal cycle for this, per my therapist - concerned about me now stumbling towards depression.)"
6804,I just don't know how to keep myself in check between now &amp; when I start proper therapy.
6805,I've had anxiety for a while now- went to therapy but it didn't help and it just sort of disappeared on its own.
6806,I've have a couple sessions over the phone with a therapist which has helped me with breathing techniques and trying to change my frame of mind so I'm more relaxed about the idea of presenting in front of hundreds of people.
6807,"The therapy has helped, but the fear of completely choking in front of everyone, basically having a panic attack, is still in the back of my mind."
6808,I read about Inderal/Propranolol (my therapist even takes 5 mg occasionally) and managed to get my primary care doctor to prescribe me thirty 10 mg pills.
6809,"However, I don't think he really realizes or understands the levels of nervousness I feel, whereas my therapist has had to deal with similar issue herself."
6810,"I also see a therapist who specializes in anxiety and eating disorders (and addiction, but it's not too relevant in this situation) and he is fabulous."
6811,"My parents forced me into therapy too which was terrifying because every psychologist I went to was a condescending douchebag, and I never wanted to see one again after I stopped."
6812,"My therapist I talk to pushes me to do things I know I wouldn't be able to do without consequences, and she says patronizing shit like ""Wow!"""
6813,My therapist told me to always remember two words...
6814,Go to support groups get on medication or go see a therapist!
6815,I was on the fence about doing these things for sooo long because I was afraid that people would look down on me or that if I went to a therapist it would mean there was actually something wrong with me!
6816,"It still went okay, I talked with my ex about things, she encouraged me to find a therapist here and consoled me."
6817,"I took half of it (50mg) and tomorrow I'm going to buy a pack (without a doctor's orders but it's not like there was a lot of check ups earlier either, I got my original prescription from an ER doctor who I saw twice afterwards...)

I'm pretty sure I won't be able to get state-funded therapy since I'm not willing to delve so deep in despair that their thresholds would be filled."
6818,"I'm seeing a therapist tomorrow who works with eating disorder, so I'm sure I'll get good advice, but I'd like to know if any of you have any advice?"
6819,"He has a general anxiety disorder that he admits to, has seen a therapist for in the past and takes medication (*Ativan*) for."
6820,"I am a skeptic at heart, and this sounds like a lot of bull, and that I'd be better off with a therapist, but out of plain curiosity: has anyone tried hypnosis as a way of dealing with anxiety before?"
6821,"I also have some paranoia issues, and what my therapist calls OCD traits."
6822,"Previously, I had been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist as I apparently have a mixture of depression, anxiety, and also exhibit bipolar characteristics."
6823,"Eventually my therapist corresponded with my parents and pleaded that my health was not getting any better, and I needed to be sent home ASAP."
6824,"No more therapist, medication has ceased."
6825,"I'm on Paxil and I have a therapist, but the meds aren't helping and I don't have an appointment for a while."
6826,"I've been seeing a therapist at the school, trying to sort these things out."
6827,"My mother refuses to take me to see anyone about it, and I'm not sure how to get myself started to go talk to a therapist, so I'm stuck."
6828,I really want to go see a therapist for some help but i cannot afford to pay full price.
6829,"Due to my depression, I'm also seeing a therapist (CBT) but that hasn't helped a whole lot regarding my anxiety."
6830,"I used to feel like a bad person for thinking these things, but therapy has helped me understand what is going on and how to control it (somewhat)."
6831,"I want to see a therapist for this, because I think that the problem is starting to become too hard for me to control."
6832,"I checked what my insurance covers, though, and it seems like it might be too expensive for me at the moment to seek a therapist, so I don't know what alternatives I could take, but I know I don't want this to continue any longer."
6833,"I've tried seeing therapists in the past about this, but it never went well, for various reasons."
6834,"A decade ago, I went through pretty much all the major classes of anti-depressants under two separate psychiatrists, and none of them worked at all, so I have more or less zero belief that further attempts at therapy or medication would be effective (on I think reasonably good grounds, though of course it's hard for me to know how warped my own thinking is, and I know that thinking this is a common delusional aspect of severe depression)."
6835,I've tried visiting therapists specifically about this issue — three of them — without any progress.
6836,"But, as wonderful as they are, if I have one more of my cousins come up to me and try to talk to me about how they also have an ""anxiety problem"" and they should ""totally be medicated"" or ""really want to get a therapy dog,"" I will scream."
6837,I'm waiting for 20 minutes in a lobby about to see my therapist I haven't visited in 5 months for an emergency therapy session.
6838,"This isn't really asking for advice, more that I just need to tell someone what's going on and how shitty I feel right now, and my first therapy appointment isn't until tomorrow."
6839,I finally started therapy in january.
6840,"My therapist said it's normal to feel this way in the beginning, but i'm ruining my life one day at a time."
6841,"Best thing my therapist has said: ""The most important thing you can do is succeed at being yourself."""
6842,I had my anxiety under control for a long while after going to CAMH and finding an incredible cognitive behaviour therapist that really understood me.
6843,"I think I need to go on medication to at least take the edge off while I get back into therapy...my boyfriend and I are going back to university 2700 km away from home...(him for law and me for biology), I don't exactly feel ready for the move or for school."
6844,Is it possible to go onto the meds for however long I need them and stop taking them when I feel therapy is enough?
6845,"I'm going to see my therapist this week, so I'm sure she will be able to answer these questions...just want some advice from people with real experience with anti anxiety medication."
6846,Think I need meds to take the edge off while I get back into therapy.
6847,Wondering if side effects are worth it and if I can take them temporarily to help while in therapy.
6848,I also think one of my therapist would have said something about it by now.
6849,I am scared to seek help for therapy in case I am diagnosed with some horrible mental illness.
6850,I've been going to therapy.
6851,Ever since I started on my Prozac and started going to therapy my panic attacks went from 1-4 a day to about 1-4 a month and recently only getting one if something big happens and not just out of the blue.
6852,"Hi all,

I trust you all more than Google (and know the best thing is to find a therapist)."
6853,"I can seek out a therapist, look into things like CBT, meditation, etc."
6854,"So after several bouts of anxiety/depression, which I have gone to therapy for, I've been prescribed 3 different benzo's and now just recently Buspar."
6855,"I can't even afford to see a therapist because my insurance is terrible, and I lack the time to go see one."
6856,There are several of us now in therapy.
6857,"I have been trying to work past it with my therapist, but yesterday another colleague of mine came in and started commanding me like I was a dog, talking harshly to me and then finally spouting a litany of things that were similar to the things the other colleague use to say to me."
6858,"I have tried guided meditations, once with a therapist and once on my own, and I feel like my throat is resisting efforts to relax."
6859,I'm considering seeing a massage therapist.
6860,There are virtually no therapists near me.
6861,"There are therapists in St. Paul, like an hour away, but I don't have a license and don't want to put that stress on my family."
6862,Part of my therapy was recording ABC sheets.
6863,I've been suffering from OCD based anxiety for a long time (only realized it was OCD based a couple months ago after seeing a therapist).
6864,My therapist says people with OCD generally benefit from medication but I would like to try some natural remedies.
6865,I ended up mustering the courage to get a therapist and completely overhaul my life for the better.
6866,"I see my therapist once a week, and on the day of(today) I always experience increased anxiety and anger."
6867,"I love my therapist, I feel so comfortable with her, and actually speak to her quite often outside of therapy."
6868,"The last 2 weeks I have not experienced a panic attack except on my therapy days, which in and of itself is amazing."
6869,I had an appointment tomorrow to see my therapist that i set up 2 weeks ago.
6870,I mean letting go of your boundaries and actually trust that the therapist won't do you harm.
6871,"At the evaluation I didn't want to bring up a suicide attempt couple years ago, sugar-coated some things and when the therapist saw a red flag in something I told her I belittled it like it didn't matter even though I made the hours voluntarily without anyone knowing about it."
6872,I'm not sure of any good therapists or of CBT in my area.
6873,"I want to pursue therapy and going on medication, but the problem is that money is tight in my family right now and our insurance sucks so I don't think that we can afford it."
6874,"My worst fear was that it was cancer, and that'd lead myself and my family into financial ruin with the surgery and chemotherapy."
6875,"Last summer, I decided that I was no longer okay with living with my anxiety, and have been in therapy (CBT) ever since."
6876,"Very recently, I've noticed that I can barely recognize myself - I have been able to take the actual manifestation of my greatest fear in stride, among other things, and therapy has changed my life."
6877,"I saw a therapist a few years ago but left because she was pressuring me to ""get well"" at her pace, rather then my own."
6878,"I'm also trying to find a psychiatrist and a therapist out here, since I've been cowering in our room for the past week and I obviously need help."
6879,Scheduling an emergency therapy appointment.
6880,But he is a family Dr. and not a mental health therapist or psychiatrist or anything.
6881,"I should have known at that point staying home would be the best thing, but back when I was going to therapy I was told that doing stuff I don't want to is the only way I'll get better."
6882,"I’m 34 now and I still suffer with anxiety but I’ve made major strides in learning to manage it through lots of therapy, pharamacology, and reading on the topic."
6883,"By digging out of anxiety and depression a number of times (and although the anxiety and depression symptoms may be different each time), the things I now know help me out of it are quite predictable:  Exercise more, make time to work on calm breathing (I swear by simple bell and chime breathing from the coherence website), get in for a therapy session or two, ease up on alcohol, write out the issues I am facing with solutions, make sure I am getting enough sleep, talk my spouse and trusted friends for support."
6884,"Plus aside from the good effects of taking positive action, the things I’ve implemented (exercise, meditative breathing, human contact with therapist, reaching out to loved ones, friends, cutting back on booze) all give your brain chemistry a much needed boost."
6885,I swear by a good therapist.
6886,"My therapist knows my patterns, can be honest with me, can kick my ass, be a voice of reason, and acts as a reminder that you've gotten through worse."
6887,I wouldn't be where I am in my fight against these issues without my therapist.
6888,"That said, I've had a very shitty therapist too and they can make your issues far worse (you finally get up the courage to talk to a professional and they don't match your needs and you feel even more hopeless because therapy is actually making it worse)."
6889,It is worth taking the time to find a therapist that works for you.
6890,"**Hi all,  
A large part of the cognitive behavioural therapy I'm undergoing currently is challenging my behaviour and not using any of the safety behaviours I've learned over the years."
6891,"Been on more medications than I can remember for anxiety and depression since 12, and therapy since 10."
6892,"(thats also when it became an actual problem)

The therapist identifies it with me as ""Hyper vigilance"" you see, prior to the time I started 'worrying' about my health I had issues with my father, and would constantly be treading glass around him, this is where it started, constantly having one ear out listening for his diesel truck pulling into the drive, so I could quickly bury myself in some school work or something to appease him."
6893,"I do my tummy breathing, I do my relaxation therapy."
6894,"I have recently been thinking of going to a therapist for anxiety - a few members in my family have OCD and I notice I may experience some similar feelings of anxiety that they describe, though nowhere near as severe."
6895,"I have never been to a therapist before (am still wondering if it is something I should do) and I don't know how to navigate the NYC system, so I was wondering if anyone had any advice/resources/recommendations."
6896,So I have a therapist I like.
6897,"After an intake visit 8 weeks later, they tell me that in order to see their psychiatrist, I must leave my therapist and see theirs."
6898,"Their therapist, apparently the cadillac of therapists, is about twice the cost of mine."
6899,"I've explained repeatedly that I already have a therapist, that I don't want a new therapist, that the cost concerns me, that I'm only interested in medication management."
6900,So I decided to see a therapist.
6901,Then he said I'm afraid I'm going to have to send you on leave until you get a paper signed by my therapist.
6902,I absolutely hate having to go to see my therapist!
6903,"I was put on Zoloft, Ativan, and went back to therapy."
6904,"I was in therapy last year but we never touched on this, and I don't have insurance to see her anymore."
6905,"She advised going to see a therapist and my parents were completely on board, but I'm scared."
6906,I have a VERY hard time opening up to others and I'm nervous that this will prevent me from taking  full advantage of the benefits that therapy has to offer.
6907,"I've finally told my parents (two days ago, after I just realized I couldn't take it anymore) and they've set me up with a therapist."
6908,"I was diagnosed with anxiety NOS in the fall of 2007, and until last summer had been seeing a therapist at my university."
6909,"I graduated last summer, and although my therapist has a private practice in addition to being on staff at the college, I haven't seen him since July."
6910,"My therapist asked me to document mood changes, anxiety attacks, and feelings of depression for a week."
6911,"Here are a few things that I learned from my therapist and which I still use:

1: Write down what I fear, and level of fear in percents."
6912,"I'm afraid of going to a counselor again because if I use the free ones from work they'll probably be unhelpful, and real therapists are expensive, not to mention it could jeopardize my job."
6913,"If I DID need medication, can a therapist prescribe me something?"
6914,I don't even have health insurance to see a therapist to figure out why I'm such a fuck up.
6915,My mom put her in therapy for a bit.
6916,One anxious acquaintance of mine exhibits it severely enough to warrant daily medication and weekly therapy appointments.
6917,One person saw a therapist for only a brief stint until they identified a good medication schedule for her.
6918,"Another went to a therapist and never returned after an incredibly negative experience, but still reads credible literature on the subject for self-education."
6919,"I myself see a cognitive-behavioral therapist occasionally and sometimes participate in group sessions, but don’t have any prescriptions."
6920,"Whether that means simply reading about various disorders, trying homeopathic remedies, or even seeking out a therapist, that first small step can make a huge difference months down the line."
6921,"I talk more naturally with people, whitout fearing the scary awkward *silence* since then i never had anxiety anymore (well i was still on my second anti depressant, the first ones didin't worked well) 

i saw a psycholoist but it was meh... he was cool and young but not much connection from me to him and it's something crucial for therapy."
6922,"medications is not obligatory to get better, in my case it helped me greatly, but keep in mind a single therapy will work too, and help you solving your problems."
6923,"I realize that medication and therapy work best when done together, however my anxiety issues were talked about and dealt with by my therapist a few years ago when I was seeing her for depression."
6924,"I don't have money for therapy nowadays, but I don't know if my doctor would willingly just give me something so I could get through my panic attacks, because I already know how to coach myself through and adjust my thoughts, it's just that I can't keep up with my thoughts right now."
6925,I did the therapy thing and I was put on medication (Zoloft).
6926,I finally got better about 6 months later with a therapist helping me out.
6927,"Along with therapy, it eventually helped me get better and I stopped taking it (tapered off, obviously)."
6928,"I'm being treated medically and with therapy, I am no longer completely lonely and I have been making efforts to do things, even ones I don't like."
6929,"I have also been going to a therapist, who is helpful."
6930,I have no preference for a therapist of one gender or another.
6931,"I'm doing everything I can (with the help of therapy, meds) to work out my issues independently."
6932,"I'm searching for a therapist, and there are a bunch of categories, but I don't know know what this would be categorized as- PTSD?"
6933,"When looking for a therapist, what should I be looking for?"
6934,"i've been through therapy/seen a counselor a few times (the last time was about 4-ish years ago) and i've taken anti-anxiety/anti-depressants in the past, presently i'm not doing either of those forms of treatment."
6935,"I've tried changing the scenery, complete isolation, exercise, different study habits, therapy, prozac, anything you can think of, with dick for results."
6936,"I had one of the aforementioned ‘anxiety attacks’ when I was 16, and went to therapy, but I wasn’t receptive to it at the time."
6937,I had two sessions with the therapist and was diagnosed with anxiety/depression and was to meet with a psychiatrist the next week to decide on a medication plan.
6938,I also saw a therapist in college (two sessions again) to try to get rid of my emotionally abusive boyfriend at the time.
6939,"But the therapist only wanted to talk about my father (I felt too confronted and didn’t know at the time about ‘original abusers,’ etc.)"
6940,"Finally a bit over a year ago my mom got a referral to a therapist( She is a LWS, Licensed Social Worker, I don't know if that makes any difference at all, but thats what it says on her card lol)."
6941,Heck getting dropped off at the therapist was hard in itself.
6942,We worked on CBT and exposure therapy.
6943,"So couple CBT with exposure therapy, which meant I had to tactfully get out in the world and PUSH myself to have anxiety."
6944,"Along with CBT, exposure therapy, my meds, I managed to make it work."
6945,"All thanks to my therapist that gave me these homework assignments to push myself, who made sure I was making progress."
6946,"Walked out of there with a prescription, an apointment with a therapist &amp; a hug."
6947,I currently cannot afford to see a therapist or take anxiety meds at this time.
6948,Good news is I started therapy earlier today..
6949,I've got a friend currently in therapy that is being recommended for an elevated level of care via medication management.
6950,I have and am currently seeking therapy.
6951,"Ok, so I now know, and am sure that I need therapy and medication for this disorder I have."
6952,"Anyway, I did it because 1) aversion therapy and 2) professional networking."
6953,My therapist has strongly recommended I start medicating my GAD.
6954,I went to therapy for about a year when I was 12 because of my panic attacks and anxiety.
6955,It came back with depression and I've been in therapy again ever since.
6956,My therapist said I have social anxiety.
6957,"Ideally, I'd love a place that combines meditation, yoga, mindfulness therapies/counseling, and nutrition..."
6958,I will be finding a new therapist soon.
6959,"She screamed and fought when she heard she had to go back to the therapist, when she was younger she was in counseling and anger management and it was terrible."
6960,Because I was a college freshman (living in dorms and just moved back to my parent's house on Thursday) I have been unable to receive therapy or medications.
6961,"I start college in 3 months and just started cognitive behavioral therapy, but at this point I dont know what I should do."
6962,"My self esteem is plummeting from the overeating and uncertainty of whether i have gained weight or not or if i will in the future, and i can't weigh myself to check because my therapist wont allow me to own a scale... i just needed to rant and see if anyone has any advice on anything that might help me with my body image or to stop over eating."
6963,"The closest I got to actually seeking help was a voicemail I left for the school's therapist, asking to schedule a time to meet with him."
6964,"http://ow.ly/JxcGa via @PsychCentral

iPrevail is a free online CBT therapy program that reduces symptoms of anxiety based on a mental health assessment."
6965,"I'm starting therapy on Monday, but right now, I still get so worked up that the damage is already done, that even if I get better control of my anxiety, it's not going to be enough, that the reason he's telling me to not worry about him and just focus on me is that he's preparing to leave."
6966,"I'm a 23 year old female and I've never been to a psychiatrist, but I went to a therapist for a few months and I told her about my moving issues and she didn't really give me too much useful advice, honestly."
6967,"After seeing a therapist in high school, I came to the realization that I always felt worse after talking to her, and thus concluded that it was the right choice to handle it introspectively."
6968,"I've got a huge network of support between my mom, dad, step-parents, step-siblings, friends, therapist, and my doctors.."
6969,I have been to the doctor and am waiting for my first therapist appointment in two weeks.
6970,I recently started therapy due to anxiety problems.
6971,"I see a therapist, the anxiety remains."
6972,I can't afford therapy.
6973,I've read a little about EMDR therapy and it seemed benign enough to try at home by myself.
6974,I've read that some people experience negative emotional side effects that can last for hours or even days EMDR therapy.
6975,I'm on a waiting list for therapy but in the meantime they've left me with NOTHING to help.
6976,"I am broke, so while I really want to try therapy so I can get a hold of myself again, I was wondering if anyone knew of any programs for people in my shoes?"
6977,"The combination of drugs, and seeing a therapist regularly has made me actually move forward with my life, even if it's only a few steps."
6978,"I've recently gotten another job, and I can't afford to screw this up, I feel like I need medication to control it but the councillors / therapists I saw in the past didn't bring up medication at all."
6979,"I have another appointment with a new therapist, but I live in New Zealand and I don't know if that changes things."
6980,I don't know anyone who's seen a therapist and been prescribed medication here.
6981,"After talking it over with my therapist, I stopped worrying about it, and the tension I was experiencing there just went away."
6982,I don't really think I have it in my to see a therapist.
6983,"I'm working on ""exposure therapy"" with my doctor."
6984,"I saw a therapist in college, but because the school made it pretty easily available."
6985,"I ended up, with a little courage from Reddit, talking to my roommate who used to see a therapist regularly."
6986,"Rommate connected me with his therapist, therapist was very receptive and said he could gladly give me a consultation."
6987,"As an added benefit, if I don't like this recommendation, my roommates therapist encouraged me to notify him so we can try to find a better fit."
6988,"I see a therapist already for mental health, but that's every 2 weeks and I'm really wanting to make it through a day."
6989,"So I'm in therapy and I'm learning to not get carried away with my imaginings, but sometimes I fear that I'll end up on the other end of the spectrum - not getting medical aid for anything because ""it's just my hypochondria, it's probably nothing""."
6990,They have group therapy to help with relationship issues and individual therapy to help deal with the particulars of my anxiety.
6991,"Maybe I'll need to go back to therapy, but what kind of therapy is there to help me get out of this feeling of being stuck in my life?"
6992,"I want to see a therapist, I have to look into whether my insurance covers it or if I could afford it, even."
6993,"I know a suggestion is going to be cognitive therapy, but honestly I feel like I'm at a point where I could get through this on my own, if only I knew how."
6994,"I'm ready to take steps, I have promised to seek out therapy."
6995,"I recently my therapist suggested that I go see a physiologist, so I did."
6996,So is that possible and I should go to a therapist or should I just stop worrying and chill and they will eventually go away when I feel better?
6997,I am on meds and in therapy.
6998,"I'm 20, and I'm a trans woman (I've been on hormone therapy for 6 months now) so if I do have cancer it's because I brought it onto myself by starting to take estrogen."
6999,"In addition to this, I made an appointment with a counselor at my university to inquire about cognitive behaviour therapy."
7000,"I'm seeing a therapist about the things I just described, but haven't mentioned those ""superstitious"" thoughts to her yet."
7001,"I found out it runs in my family, mother and brother, and i went to a doctor and asked for a reference to a psych covered under my insurance

Long story short, no psychiatrists or therapists they recommended even carried my insurance, the doctors were useless other than the lorazapam they gave for extreme situations of panic attacks and i walked out of there with nothing

Does anyone know of a site or really just anything i can use as a resource to find a good psychiatrist or even where i start this whole thing?"
7002,"I think I read somewhere that anxiety medication ideally is only for short-term use (maybe six months - a year or so), and should be used in conjunction with some sort of effective psychotherapy."
7003,I guess I'm asking because I've been having therapy for a few months and haven't noticed any reduction in my anxiety.
7004,"I'm wondering if medication would actually help in my case, or if the potential reduction in anxiety would only be short-term and unsustainable given that the therapy doesn't seem to be working."
7005,"I've been told by therapists and psychiatrists that it's likely a combination of genetic (biochemical) and environmental factors, and through my own research, and being a student of biology, I know they are probably right."
7006,On top of my group CBT I will also have a personal therapist (hopefully) sometime in the future.
7007,"At least then I'd go out of the house regularly, now it's only for therapy and when I can be bothered to visit my grandma or the supermarket."
7008,My therapist says I never learned to self-soothe which is why my panic attacks get so bad because my brain has literally NO IDEA how to calm me down...
7009,I need to get back into therapy and find the right meds.
7010,"I am currently in therapy and occasionally have Xanax on hand for crises, but fortunately the panic attacks have greatly diminished in the past 6 months."
7011,I havnt been in my therapy long so don't yet have many useful ways to calm down when feeling this bad.
7012,"I haven't looked forward to anything in a long time, and I can't afford a therapist or meds."
7013,"I've got my first appointment with a therapist in a few weeks, but she's booked up before then."
7014,My old therapist said this was OCD because I also return sneakers every time I buy them because of money.
7015,I had a therapist but he told me I should stop seeing him.
7016,"&amp;nbsp;

A year ago I started my first project about nano medicine in chemo therapy and it turned out to be really stressfull."
7017,"Luckily, I know I will be seeing a therapist when I start."
7018,I've been in desperate need of therapy for a while now and cannot find the courage to figure out how to get there.
7019,"I'm terrified to call in to make an appointment, but was able to email the therapist."
7020,"The therapist I emailed gave me instructions on where I needed to call and what I needed to ask, but my anxiety is making it so difficult to make the call."
7021,"I mean, how do you keep going to a therapist when you are worried that they don't like you?"
7022,"Not much a stranger to my school's therapists so I guess I'm not too worried there, thanks for the input."
7023,They wanted me to start therapy.
7024,My friend offered to pay for my first visit to a therapist I know.
7025,I was looking into CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) or hypnosis.
7026,"Trapped in my own head, I’m done
Problems come, solutions none
Put on a face that says I won
But the more I think, the more I run

Free fall, free fall, free fall
Free fall, free fall, free fall

Brief distraction, I’m having fun
The darkest night, now a rising sun
And just when I think the pain is done
Panic sets in, I come undone

Free fall, free fall, free fall
Free fall, free fall, free fall

My brain won’t stop, it never quits
And logic won’t make sense of it
I want to stop, but can’t submit
No bottom in an endless pit

Free fall, free fall, free fall
Free fall, free fall, free fall

Sometimes it feels like I won’t make it
Out of breath, my heart can’t take it
I tried therapy, I’ve been medicated
But one small trigger, still devastated

Free fall, free fall, free fall
Free fall, free fall, free fall

Up all night, can’t fall asleep
Mind is racing, not counting sheep
Can’t call in sick, no more excuses
How long until I finally lose it?"
7027,I am currently a week drug free and going to therapy to address my mental health.
7028,"I've seen more therapists than you can count and people have marked my struggle as anything from indifference to laziness to just plain a ""phase""."
7029,I'm on a generic for Prozac but that doesn't seem to be helping much and no doctor or therapist can schedule an appointment for me because they're all full.
7030,"I'm trying to do the right thing, meditation, breathing exercises, journaling, exercise, I cut out all fast foods, quit smoking cigarettes, and I start counseling with a new therapist on Thursday."
7031,I've been taking medications ever since and I've been to therapy although it didn't help.
7032,I'm seeing a therapist who's helping me to get to the root of it.
7033,I've been seeing a therapist recently in order to make sense of some of the things that have been happening with me.
7034,"The therapist has told me that I really need to continue doing this when I go back to school (in another state), and to consider taking medication because this has been going on for so long that it may be chemical."
7035,"I did a little therapy in college, but my counselor was a graduate student and she left, and they've also eliminated individual therapy because of budget cuts and gone to just group therapy."
7036,"So I've just finished one of my therapy sessions for anxiety and googled my therapist as he told me he has written a book, to my surprise I find out he's an ex bank robber who's turned his life around."
7037,Do you know that did an eight week long exposure therapy online to try to fix myself?
7038,"And yes, I'm going to a therapist."
7039,I've been told that I should go to a therapist and talk to someone about my nightmares and such but I don't know what I'd say or where to start or anything.
7040,I honestly don't want to admit I was a victim and I don't know what I would say to this therapist.
7041,How can I push through this and convince myself to go seek help so I can actually get a good nights sleep and how would I open up to this therapist?
7042,"Despite being in therapy I found that my symptoms were not being alleviated and I had to force myself through each day of my life knowing that I would likely wake up already anxious, spend my day in that state and have trouble sleeping at night due to my catastrophic thought patterns as I was already anticipating my anxiety the following day."
7043,I ended up in therapy again for the 4th time in my life knowing that if I did not get my anxiety and depression under control that I was going to kill myself.
7044,I was set up with a therapist and had to focus on functioning before I could get help.
7045,Before therapy I had put in hundreds of hours of research into curing my anxiety.
7046,"As it turns out, my therapist was wrong."
7047,"My therapist says I'm feeling residual guilt about dad, but if anything I'm really just pissed off at him for being dead (another issue entirely)."
7048,"There was talk of getting me to see a therapist, but nothing materialized."
7049,"I saw a therapist for a while, but saw the questions where increasing heading towards a ""thoughts like this can get your institutionalized"" direction and stopped."
7050,Are they going to prescribe drugs or recommend therapy?
7051,"I was told by my therapist that I will feel this weight for the rest of my life, but I can learn to live a better life."
7052,"And no, I am not in therapy, because of my moving around situation right now because of university."
7053,"I'm currently working with my therapist to figure out what is triggering my anxiety, and I'm curious to know; what makes you anxious?"
7054,(I'm not a professional therapist just a student of life).
7055,"Took Lexapro for nearly two years or so before taking myself off it for numerous reasons, was okay for a few months, real life shit hit the fan, and am currently in weekly therapy after living in pure panic for January 2011."
7056,"I've been working on all of that with my therapist for the past few weeks, and while I'm still pretty upset about both things I know once I get there that my cats will be happy and looked after, and that staying with his family will give me the opportunity to really deal with my uncle's death."
7057,I have worked with a therapist and have gained a little bit of ground but not much.
7058,"I went to therapy once, someone my mom set me up with, and it was horrible."
7059,"I stopped going after a few months telling my mom I felt better because she wouldn't let me switch therapists - she works at a hospital and she didn't believe me when I said I didn't like her (""Give her a chance, Shelly always talks about how good she is!"
7060,"I know I need to schedule therapy, and it's free on campus, but I just can't."
7061,I don't know if I could trust whatever therapist I'm talking to right away.
7062,"I went to the psychologist at my high school (before the actual therapy), and it took me about a year of going to actually open up about some of my problems, not even all of them."
7063,So I go to my therapist on Tuesday.
7064,is my therapist really breaking up with me in the middle of a crisis?
7065,I am not at a point where I can not be in therapy.
7066,"Well, long story short, everything was getting worse so I brought up medicine with my therapist and got a prescription to Zoloft and lorazepam."
7067,I have 2 sessions left with my therapist before I have to move.
7068,I've met with this therapist the past 2 years and before that had 2 separate periods which lasted 3 months.
7069,In the times in between when I was living in other places I was never able to find a therapist I liked.
7070,I went through a rollercoster of finding a therapist and not having it be a good fit (sometimes even the therapist firing me) then freaking out then finding another therapist and starting over.
7071,We found me a new therapist but I have no way of knowing if things will work out.
7072,I'm so scared of going back into my cycle of finding a new therapist every couple months.
7073,I tried to tell myself that maybe I'd no longer need therapy in 2 years.
7074,It was supposed to last until i saw the new therapist.
7075,All the moving related tasks and trying up loose ends before leaving are freaking me out and I wish I just could know the therapist situation will be stable then everything else would be okay.
7076,"I've been going to therapy and forcing myself to leave the house at least once a week, but even the therapist is stumped at how persistent these panic attacks are."
7077,I've been in therapy with three different counselors for two years now and it's not helping.
7078,I don't want to do therapy for my anxiety.
7079,I honestly don't really know why I'm even posting this...I'm just at a point where I feel like I need some sort of outside input that isn't therapy from a source that also has dealt with anxiety.
7080,I am seeing a therapist who is actually really helping.
7081,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
7082,"Every place I looked said these symptoms were anxiety related, so I worked at managing my anxiety disorder and seeing a therapist regularly."
7083,"I don't want to go to a psychiatrist because I'm poor and can't afford treatment, and I'm hesitant to go to therapy and pay a bunch of money just to talk about my problems."
7084,"She's currently seeing a psychiatrist, neurologist, therapist, and going to group therapy."
7085,"Hello,
The reason I asked this is because it wasn't until I went through CBT therapy that I realised quite how anxious I was."
7086,"Well just to give a heads up that I have concluded that sites like compassionpit,blahtherapy used to work and now are broken."
7087,I hope meds will work for me or some therapy will change me.
7088,"I'm physically sub-par today (cold/allergies/achy/hormone stuff) and my therapist is out of town for two weeks, so I'm not in the best place."
7089,"I started therapy in January, and now have been diagnosed with ADHD and GAD."
7090,"I'm on medication for the anxiety, and between the med and therapy, I've made huge strides."
7091,My idea of how to attack this was to get medication while therapy could help me really fix the underlying causes.
7092,"I know I should get professional help and took a CBT course online, but my insurance doesn't cover therapy."
7093,Hey /r/anxiety I was diagnosed with GAD when I was 13 and I have been on several meds and been going to therapy since then.
7094,I try focusing on it the way my therapist suggested (mindful body scans) and all it ends up doing is making me notice my pulse more.
7095,"I was prescribed 10mg of Celexa for anxiety, because I've reached a point in therapy and self-work where things are not improving much anymore, so I have decided I should try medication for a while and see what happens."
7096,I started therapy for my effed up childhood the first week of January this year.
7097,When I was younger I saw my alcoholic mother vomit a few times and my therapist thinks the fact that she died may have altered that memory to be extremely frightening.
7098,"Now:

I met with my therapist the next day and she explained that this resurfacing could be the result of therapy - it tends to bring things up to the surface so that they can be worked with."
7099,"&lt;3

tl;dr

Student having resurfacing of debilitating panic attacks after starting therapy, prescribed cipralex but unsure if want take."
7100,i have been in therapy for a few years now after i lost a parent.
7101,I worked with a therapist and after a while my OCD actually went away.
7102,I am currently seeing a therapist so that helps some.
7103,"Just a few pills when the anxiety gets really bad, so I can talk to a therapist on wednesday."
7104,"You might think that I might've developed symptoms whilst going through chemotherapy, but oddly enough I was calm and positive throughout that entire experience."
7105,"After my chemotherapy finished and I got the all clear from my doctors in February, I started getting a little paranoid about every little health issue."
7106,"But after doing my research and speaking to several therapists, nurses, and psychiayrists, I felt that the side effects of ssris are too much."
7107,"I don't know where to find inner courage, or to articulate my frustrations to him or a therapist because everything feels so cloudy."
7108,In 2009 I finally decided to take steps to help after a particularly bad bout of it and started meds and seeing a therapist.
7109,"She put 4 pens on the table, representing hospitalization, PHP (partial hospitalization) 5 days a week, groups, and individual therapy, IOP (intensive outpatient) group 3x (9 hours)  a week + individual therapy once a week, and regular outpatient."
7110,"She said she'd talk to another therapist and see if they'd see me, but I feel very pessimistic now...."
7111,"If this therapist that intake talks to isn't willing to see me twice a month, I may have to get another referral to yet another clinic."
7112,"Through out 2013 and half of 2014 i was half assing it with my appointments, medication and therapy."
7113,"Would medication/therapy that effects Social Anxiety help ""cure"", or at least treat, stuttering?"
7114,"Long story short, seen more than my fair share of waterlogged corpses, been abused etc etc all leading to a pretty monstrous anxiety problem that I can usually handle on my own without medication after a long ride with a great therapist."
7115,"I tried to take a nap because that usually does the trick to calm me down but I had one of those nuclear attack burning dreams and I can feel one of those attacks (my old therapist dubbed them ""grand mal attacks""."
7116,"I´m overweight Male 23, medicated with paroxetine and clonazepam, also going to therapy (jungian)."
7117,"Been like this since 2 years, therapy since 1 and psychiatrist since 6 months."
7118,I'm already going to invest money for skin treatment so I'm not sure if I can afford therapy but I would really like to go to a doctor to get prescribed some anti-anxiety medication in moments where I just can't go outside due to my acne scars.
7119,Should I see a speech therapist?
7120,"Still, I worry that things are going to get worse instead of better, and don't know if I should see a therapist or get medication or just try to deal with it mentally somehow."
7121,"She was not willing to try medication or seek therapy, so I was ready to love her for who she was and accept that things would just be difficult for her at times."
7122,"I have had previous success using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with a therapist, and want to use this sub as a place for me to identify these irrational thoughts I suppose."
7123,Note: I still can't get a therapist and have never had one (parents unsupportive narcissists and I don't have a good counselor) but I plan to try and get one when I move out in a year.
7124,"So now it's manifesting physically and one of the biggest symptoms has been sickening causes.I made an appointment with my therapist for this week, but in the meantime, has anyone else experienced this?"
7125,"After months of being able to manage my anxiety and depression quite well (with the help of a therapist), I suddenly am having such an anxiety-ridden day."
7126,"I am in therapy; my therapist suggests it's related to self-esteem because I can't help but feel making out as predatory/forced and like ""he is only doing this to me because it is a date and that is what you do on dates"" rather than doing it because he genuinely likes me."
7127,Its part of exposure therapy and getting out my comfort zone.
7128,She is also in group therapy at the moment through her school.
7129,"It's not that I'm afraid, but its that I have this unresolved anxiety and I know I need to be in therapy."
7130,"I've been in therapy before, but I'm just getting back into it soon and I'm wondering if it would be good for me to isolate it-- take a full leave of absence from school to work on myself and work part time and study independently, or if I should continue with a class or two and just take a very, very light load of classes at my school while going to therapy in my city?"
7131,My mind always seems to trick me into thinking that my anxiety isn't severe enough to qualify for medication or even therapy sometimes.
7132,"As of the time i started this post, I have 8 hours and 3 minutes left til i go meet with a therapist for the 1st time in my life."
7133,"I signed up for therapy, but I feel like I should get some advice from someone who might feel the same way."
7134,"There should be a person called a ""Mental Health Concierge"" where when you need help you just call this one person and you tell them your problems and your insurance/budget and they find a therapist for you."
7135,I've tried therapists and meds before but they never seemed to have an effect so I'm skeptical of even trying.
7136,I tried seeing a therapist earlier this year to talk about what I'd recently been through that made it worse.
7137,I couldn't even bring myself to trust my therapist.
7138,"I had gone through a lot with this older guy and I was afraid of telling my therapist because I didn't want my parents to find out what happened and she had been telling my parents everything I told her, plus there was the fear of her reporting it (is everything confidential??)."
7139,"Additionally, anytime my therapist told my parents about a problem I told her I had with them, my parents would deny it, saying they're sorry if I felt that way and they're nothing but supportive."
7140,"So after almost a year of server therapy (which is by the way the hardest thing I ever did and ever will do) I finally stopped being anxious all the time, getting panic attacks, 99% of my social anxiety was gone, I was the most strong I'd ever felt, it sucked that because my friends didn't understand what anxiety really did to me and my mind it wasn't as celebrated as I expected it to be, anyway I should've been doing everything I couldn't do whilst I was dealing with this disorder, but my ex was leading me on for this entire time and the other week all of a sudden he stopped all communication and also started saying really mean things to me about anxiety too, this coming from the person two weeks ago that said ""I love you I want to be with you for the rest of my life."""
7141,"Note--I do see a therapist and am, in fact, seeing her after work tomorrow."
7142,"I'm on 40 mg of Prozac these days, and I'm seeing a therapist."
7143,They send me home and tell me to get a therapist.
7144,"But I can't get a therapist, i'm not in the right mindset and I feel nausea every day."
7145,What are your experiences for therapy for social anxiety?
7146,"I'm in physical therapy school, and we invited some students from another program to come and have a sort of meet and greet."
7147,"I'm 24 years old, and have recently stopped seeing a therapist who I was seeing for about 6 months."
7148,"This is my first time posting, but I have been seeing a therapist and she thinks i may have anxiety and paranoia issues."
7149,"I've usually just blamed it on a lack of trust I have, but my therapist thinks its more than that and I should see a psychiatrist and get medicated."
7150,"I know why I'm susceptible to these mental illnesses and  I've half-assed tried meds, therapy, everything  

Despite having anxiety I've always managed to be strong enough to put on a face and hold down good jobs, lots of friends, been sociable and outgoing."
7151,and I've committed myself to seeing a therapist (at the cost of $130 for 50 mins).
7152,"I don't have a single person I can talk too, apart from this new therapist but I have no idea how to make it 6 more days."
7153,He wasn't my GP or my therapist.
7154,"I have never been formally diagnosed with anxiety, but that's purely because I don't have the money yet to seek therapy (which is why I need to do well in this interview)."
7155,2.Anyone have any good results from just having therapy sessions and not going the medicine route?
7156,"I am going to try counseling again but I've tried it 3 times (as a kid, a teen, and an adult) and really just wasted a lot of time and money because nothing every got better with therapy."
7157,"She's been in therapy, but her insurance didn't cover it."
7158,"Since then, I've been going to a psychotherapist at varying schedules; I now see him every 3 weeks or so."
7159,"Now, I've had SAD, and Hypochondriasis, but I've been fortunate enough to have a supportive family and a skilled therapist, and a case of anxiety where simply changing my thought process helped immensely."
7160,"I've been seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist for seven years, but with no specific type of therapy and not a whole lot of improvement, other than medication."
7161,"I am curious about those of you who are in cognitive/behavioral therapy, (or other types)."
7162,My docs think its anxiety and told me to see pyschirariy but I am seeing a therapist and I will never get on meds again.
7163,Wouldn't it be more efficient (and cheaper) to just visit the 7 cups of tea website once a week for my therapy needs?
7164,I'm getting to the point where I'm scaring myself and really want somebody to talk to but I can barely afford food and rent let alone therapy.
7165,I had some trauma as a kid and was endlessly diagnosed with depression and anxiety (always in that order) by a series of amazingly useless therapists.
7166,"As a note, I don't know how to access a therapist."
7167,"I feel much more in touch with my emotions, as a result of 2 additional years of weekly appointments with my therapist."
7168,"After a few weeks of physical therapy, I started making progress."
7169,"I'm confident that I can get back to normal after I start seeing my physical therapist again (starting tomorrow morning), but it might take time."
7170,"Ive done CBT , therapy, medication but the negative thought processes are so hard to overcome."
7171,Seems like a common factor is excise and talk with a therapist.
7172,"I have been thinking about trying cognitive behavior therapy for awhile, but am (predictably) a little anxious about how it works."
7173,"Hey all,

I just made the jump to start seeing a therapist and my first appointment is tomorrow."
7174,"I've actually been recovering pretty well from what I believe is panic disorder, but I decided that seeing a therapist might help me even more."
7175,I was wondering what level of confidentiality I can expect going into the university's mental health therapy program.
7176,"After talking to my therapist, she pinpointed that I got the message as a child that I wasn't allowed to have fun."
7177,"After so many years of going to therapist, medications, reading so much about anxiety - I haven't come across any solution to Anxiety !"
7178,"After reading a ridiculous amount of information about it over the last year or so, I've come to the conclusion that exposure therapy is my best bet."
7179,"* 4 -Go to the gym when it is busy and complete all exercises in my routine
* 5 - Pee in a urinal when there are people already at it (sober)
* 6- Sign up for any kind of social hobby and stick with it for at least 1 month
* 7- Get involved while sober in a conversation with 2 or more people who i'm not that familiar with
* 8- Go into a bar or any social situation involving alcohol while completely sober and stay there for at least 2 hours without drinking
* 9 - Compliment a stranger
* 10- Speak in front of 5 or more people in any kind of social situation or work meeting

I firmly believe that exposure therapy is the only way to beat social anxiety without taking medication."
7180,"My first post would probably go along the lines of:

Had a panic attack because I couldn't find my anxiety medication #anxietyprobs

or this (this one isn't mine but I thought it could apply):

I have anxiety issues so I am trying to seek out a therapist."
7181,"He's referred me to a therapist, and my first session is Wednesday."
7182,I had my first therapy session today.
7183,I've tried therapy once before but it really didn't work out with the therapist so I quit.
7184,"Anyway, I saw my new therapist for the first time today and he made a really good first impression."
7185,My old therapist never did such a thing.
7186,"EDIT: Oh and *of course* my stupid anxiety makes me anxious about this not working out anyway: ""what if he turns out to be a very unkind therapist?"
7187,I've been seeing a therapist once every week or two for roughly the last year.
7188,My therapy sessions don't seem to be a huge help at the moment and I'm debating starting medication if it turns out I don't have a testosterone deficiency (which likely would be addressed through testosterone patches).
7189,"(I remember the first time I learned about the concept in therapy -- when my therapist was explaining what a trigger was, the first thing that popped into my head was my dad."
7190,"I asked if people could be triggers, and it was such a revelation when my therapist said that yes, it's possible.)"
7191,This goes well...and I continue with some therapy sessions.
7192,"Upon starting cognitive behavioral therapy, though excited to fix myself, I soon realize that this isn't going to work for me."
7193,I ditched therapy - she's stumped...referred me somewhere private - too expensive...doctor put me in for a rush referral to somewhere else and they called me for an opening interview.
7194,"I want to get a therapist, but I don't want to worry my parents and I don't have the time with college applications and swimming."
7195,I'm also seeing a therapist to learn how to deal with anxiety.
7196,I just started therapy a few weeks ago and yesterday I saw a psychiatrist and she perscribed me effexor xr and klonopin for my anxiety.
7197,I hope to stay on them long enough to go through my talk therapy and overcome my anxiety.
7198,When i was in 6th grade i attempted suicide which led to about a year of therapy and medication.
7199,"http://jacobmartinez.org/post/16582315520/how-to-be-not-sad-a-few-simple-but-not-necessarily

I wrote about some steps I took while I was depressed to supplement therapy."
7200,I decided to go to a therapist.
7201,"It was a very hard thing for me to do, I thought that going to therapy meant that there was something seriously wrong with me, that I was a crazy person or something."
7202,One session of therapy was all I needed!
7203,"(although I do plan on going more) 

My therapist told me to quit drinking coffee."
7204,"Additionally, I have taken up drinking decaffeinated tea and occasionally doing yoga as my therapist had suggested and both help me relax."
7205,"Although I had a few sessions with a therapist when I was a kid, I've never seen one for anxiety."
7206,"I managed to start controlling it through therapy and some slight meds, but about a month ago I smoked again and almost had another panic attack, but was only just able to suppress it."
7207,I have been seeking therapy up  until now and still doing so.
7208,I plan on bringing this up next session with my therapist but I wanted to get everyone's opinion on it here.
7209,My therapist says I need to push through the lessons but I don't feel safe at all in the drivers seat of a car.
7210,"So I got on meds, went to a therapist and started school and everything was good."
7211,I also don't currently have a therapist.
7212,I've been experiencing what I can only describe as derealization and my current therapist thinks it might be linked to PTSD.
7213,Felt bad for a first time until my therapy started.
7214,"I'm panicking right now, I don't see my therapist until tomorrow."
7215,I've always had a sort of skeptical outlook on therapy sessions.
7216,"Was anyone skeptical in the same way as I, and did the therapist surprise you?"
7217,"I'm hoping I'll allow myself to bring this up at my next therapy appointment on Monday, but I don't know if I'm just overreacting."
7218,I don't know how or where to seek a therapist.
7219,"Psychology therapists/counselors are costly and hard to come by around here, so that's unlikely an option for me."
7220,"My therapist suggested that I only close the blinds when he is out there, but I know that wouldn't help at all."
7221,My therapist has recommended medication but I am hesitant.
7222,"You get anxiety, you see a therapist, you get medication, you take medication, you get better, you stop taking medication, repeat."
7223,She said in the meantime I can schedule an appointment with the other therapist in the office.
7224,"Her anxiety has actually gotten so bad, I've sought out a therapist myself because it's put so much strain on me."
7225,"There are a bunch of posts about therapists, medication, and different methods of treatment."
7226,My doctor and psychotherapist practically begged me to go on medication because I know I need help but I've been too nervous about it to take medication.
7227,I find it really difficult to open up to my psychiatrist and therapist about how serious my anxiety can get sometimes.
7228,"When I get into those long crying moods, I feel so overwhelmed and I get high urges to self-harm because it’s the only thing that would effectively calm me down in the past.” 

This has happened with therapists and psychiatrists I’ve had in the past, too."
7229,"My current psychiatrist and therapist are both very kind and understanding, and I know they can’t help me as much as possible unless I open up to them, but I have so much trouble doing this when I’m actually there in the room with them."
7230,"I have also never seen a therapist, but I am thinking about setting an appointment up."
7231,"With a long history of going to therapy, taking medication, and even being hospitalized."
7232,My next option (and what I will probably do anyway) is go to talk therapy.
7233,"TL;DR Bad social anxiety, want to try natural medicine and/or talk therapy before going to a psychiatrist and sacrificing my dream job to start prescription meds, looking for effective natural medicines to try."
7234,"I treated it with Effexor and therapy, and by the time I weaned myself off of Effexor I was in a great place mentally."
7235,Depending on how things go over the next few weeks I may seek out therapy again.
7236,"I didn't finish the grade, i left with about 2 months left, and over the summer and now i've been going to therapy and finally addressing the problems that i have."
7237,"In the last 20 years I've seen 12 therapists of all different methodologies, 5 psychiatrists, tried at least 20 medications (not all at the same time, ha!)."
7238,"I've had hypnotherapy, acupuncture; tried meditation (several Buddhist retreats, which were cool but didn't cure me), yoga, exercise, diet changes, read every book on the topic."
7239,So I started seeing the school therapist (college) and I've been having issues since i was really young.
7240,At this point in time psychiatry cannot help me and therapy only gets me so far.
7241,When I was younger (about 7 or 8) I was in therapy for possible schizophrenia when my previous dog died.
7242,I have to wait a month to see a psychotherapist on the NHS so I was hoping to gather some tips for either overcoming it or getting past this without requiring therapy.
7243,"I really don't want therapy, or sleeping pills, or medication."
7244,"I have already been to see a doctor who prescribed me medication which I refused (for now); I have seen a therapist, told almost everyone in my family and my good friends and hired an herbalist to help me find a good mixture of something to get me feeling like my old self."
7245,I started seeing a great therapist and got my local physician to prescribe me Wellbutrin.
7246,"I would like to seek out a new doctor or therapist to get me on medication again, but now I live in a different city currently without health insurance and the thought of seeking out a doctor and therapist is only causing more anxiety."
7247,"My therapist says because my father was so controlling, I look for a sense of structure in life."
7248,I also went to my therapist today and talked to her about my social anxiety/panic/depression/ADD.
7249,The therapist says the lack of control thing has developed into a fear of making mistakes.
7250,"But god the therapist's eyes when I was explaining all my symptoms - fear of going first, death, crowds, darkness, getting food from places like subway (I wish I could try Chipotle...It looks so good), driving, etc."
7251,I've told my older therapist from high school and she's happy to work with me again and glad I'm discussing this with someone.
7252,"After nearly a decade of therapy, and trying more medications than I can count, I've realized that I'm never going to get better."
7253,"I was wondering if anyone had experience using NLP/timeline therapy or hypnotherapy in general for treating social anxiety, general anxiety or depression."
7254,"My other option is to go on Paxil, but if NLP is as effective as my therapist says it is then I don't want to start another medication."
7255,"At the urging of a therapist, I bought a BP machine and started taking it at home as exposure therapy."
7256,A private sector therapist I used to see (my work pays for a limited number of sessions and I can't afford them myself) helped me a lot whenever I was feeling depressed.
7257,*edit:  I should add that I have tried seeing a therapist in the past and they taught me breathing techniques to calm me down in social situations.
7258,"These help, but the therapist wanted to know if I wanted to try medication to see if it would help."
7259,"I lost all contact with any friends I had after high school as I felt like I couldn't do anything (extremely vague I know but I'm crap at explaining)

Basically I went through therapy last year and it helped immensely and I also started a new job in October."
7260,"I realized recently, (about two months ago), that the way I'd been feeling isn't normal, and I started seeing a therapist."
7261,My largest fears in this is that a therapist will put me on medication which will make me addicted (which might be physically and financially unhealthy) and change me for the worse.
7262,"And then in terms of getting an emotional support animal:

•do I have to go through my therapist?"
7263,I've had 3 appointments with 2 different whatever they're called (therapists?).
7264,I then had a breakdown of sorts and am now seeing a therapist and taking Lexapro.
7265,I just started therapy a few weeks ago and I feel so abandoned.
7266,TL;DR- boyfriend of a year broke up with me just as I was starting new meds and therapy.
7267,"I'm considering a therapist, which I'll be able to afford in Feb. since we are moving then and saving a good sum per month."
7268,"I'm skeptical about talking therapy helping, since I'm an arguer and contrarian by nature and I don't think I respect ""hey, it's going to be fine"" advice unless I knew it came from someone with more knowledge than me in THAT particular area of concern."
7269,"So, I don't think I would respect a therapist's opinion on thesee particular matters."
7270,"To make things worse, I've looked through what the medical plan will cover and am pretty sure therapy wouldn't be included."
7271,"I developed phobias, certain compulsive behaviors that appeared and disappeared over the years (pulling my hair out, obsession with hygiene..) 
I only recently started winning my battle with a short, although very crippling, episode of depression(i went to therapy for this), but my anxiety still lingers."
7272,"I went on a date a few months ago and we hit it off really well (was totally sober) then he wanted to hangout again and all I could think about when we were together was ""i don't want a boyfriend"" over and over until it made me feel so weird that when he left we didn't really talk after...i don't know what's going on I've contemplated going back to therapy to talk about my issues but the worst part is feeling like I'm the only person who feels this way!"
7273,He goes to therapy and all that but I'm just worried that when me and my brother move out he won't talk to anyone.
7274,"I have just begun therapy, but due to the funding system where I live I can only go once a fortnight."
7275,"She said it was more of a 'bandaid' to help the anxiety symptoms, whilst the therapy will help me sort out the root of the problem and give me skills to cope better."
7276,"I have health insurance but am not seeing a professional at the moment because I used to see one through my university, but can’t see her anymore since I am a graduate and I haven’t found a new therapist in my price range yet."
7277,"I could have caught it in the ealry stages yesterday and I would be ok. Now I'm going to fight a long hard battle and undergo chemotherapy because I didn't say anything.NO NO, IT'S TO LATE FOR CHEMO, YOU WAITED TO LONG AND YOU ARE GOING TO DIE SOON!!!"
7278,"But as my therapist always says ""Fight it and remain calm""."
7279,"Long time lurker (on another account), first time poster:

I recently participated in an eight-week group therapy session for students at my university, and the group lead had a great breathing technique to help with stress:

4-4-8

Breathe in for four seconds, hold it for four seconds, then exhale for 8 seconds."
7280,"I know you guys are not therapists or anything, but since most of you seem experienced, I wonder if any of you have an idea of what I may have."
7281,Starting back to therapy too.
7282,"Any help or consolation you guys could offer would be great, even if it means recommending a visit to therapy and/or the doctor, everything helps."
7283,"Brief intro, I'm a transgender MTF woman, 25, been on HRT (hormone replacement therapy) for 3-4 months."
7284,"I've been seeing a therapist for over 6 months regarding my gender dysphoria, and have been aware of my anxiety for years."
7285,"After what must be dozens of complaints on my end about my mood, my therapist referred me to a psychiatrist, whom I met with yesterday."
7286,"I've only had one brush with therapy before, during the aforementioned summer, and it was a very expensive disaster."
7287,"So, I've been doing therapy for years."
7288,"""You'll be okay""
""It's all in your head"" 
""It's just a phase""
""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger""
""Have you seen a therapist yet?"""
7289,I'm an advocate of therapy even though I have never been myself as of yet.
7290,"I guess yay, I took the step to get help, but boo, scumbag anxiety makes me totally freaked out about therapy."
7291,"I'm looking for help, but I'm too scared to ask my parents for help (my parents love me and are great, and would be totally accepting if I said I wanted therapy."
7292,"I have been to therapy before, but for completely different matters, and I didn't have to ask."
7293,"I have tried to change my diet, working out, exposing myself to my fears, talking to people and therapists about it, and I even take medication but its still there."
7294,"I've never been diagnosed because while I was underage my parents never let me see a therapist, and the university therapist I saw briefly did not take me seriously and didn't care about me or do much of anything to help with my anxiety."
7295,"Needless to say, I no longer go to therapy."
7296,"I don't know what to do, and I can't even try to go back to a school therapist until fall."
7297,"I'd love for my therapist to help, but just in case she can't, what can I do?"
7298,"EDIT; I forgot to add in the bit about therapy, which I realize is a fairly obvious and valid solution to the situation I'm describing."
7299,"I should add to this, not saying therapy isn't a good thing."
7300,"My assorted therapists have talked me through CBT, breathing, distraction techniques, trigger avoidance, brain re-training, and a bunch of other stuff."
7301,"But it's taking a bloody long time, and I dislike the thought of going back to therapy just to hear what I've been told before."
7302,"I also have an unfortunate habit of lying/editing what I say to therapists because I want to sound better than I am (again, a perfectionist thing)."
7303,I've been in therapy since I was a kid and am currently in therapy and seeing a hypnotist.
7304,"I am seeing a therapist and it helps a lot, but I am nowhere near where I want to be."
7305,"Some of which were actual diagnoses at one point, but thanks to years of therapy they've largely diminished to where most shrinks just call them traits now, so whatever."
7306,"I have gone to a therapist, all of the stress/anxiety has caused my body to attack itself over the last 1 1/2 year and has caused me severe pain, but the therapist don't really seem to help."
7307,"Oh, and I am in active therapy.I have Tricare Prime for my insurance company, so everything is covered and basically nothing is off limits medication wise, testing wise, or hospital wise."
7308,"I would really love to add something to my cocktail, especially if it could get my stomach to stop hating me and if I could continue therapy and learn to know what semi normal, worry-free is."
7309,Active weekly therapy.
7310,"Through our experience, we have found that groups are more effective than individual therapy alone."
7311,"Both were supportive and offered to help with any therapy I needed etc - Personally I don't feel like I'm ready to open up to someone just yet, there's things I have locked away that I want to keep that way - nothing serious, just small things which I don't want to unravel again."
7312,"I had been going to therapy for months but my therapist had to take a time...

Now... Shit is hitting the fan."
7313,"Medication or therapy, through a good doctor, might be a good route."
7314,:) I may be trying behavioral cognitive therapy soon to try and complement the medication.
7315,My early childhood years were filled with various kinds of abuse and being forced into court sessions and therapy sessions I had no desire to go to but had no way to stop.
7316,I have an appointment with my doctor on monday and I'm going to ask about therapy for my mental issues as well.
7317,My SO has asked me to go see a therapist on campus and I care about him so I want to.
7318,I am more scared of going to the therapist than basically a lot of things.
7319,He sees a therapist but says my past is way worse than anything he has experienced) but I've always dealt with it myself.
7320,My dad tried to get me to see a therapist when I was young.
7321,I have lots of anxiety but the idea of seeing a therapist amplifies it to the point where I feel sick.
7322,"Other people see therapists all the time but ugh, I'm so stressed."
7323,So I started seeing the school therapist (college) and I've been having issues since i was really young.
7324,"Will you guys be willing to share some books, films, quotes, foods, aromatherapy, rituals, etc."
7325,I had promised my regular therapist I'd see a counselor regularly while at University to continue my treatment and I was hesitant to start with someone new.
7326,I was able to see a counselor regularly once a week for the first time since I started therapy (other therapists I've seen are always overbooked).
7327,I have a lot of friends who get turned off by condescending or inconsiderate psychiatrists/therapists or they're scared of medication.
7328,I wish for them and for anyone afraid to see a therapist to give it a chance because good experiences happen.
7329,"I'm seeing a therapist, and we've started a program that's supposed to help my hypochondriasis, but this is taking things in a new direction."
7330,"So today was my therapist appointment, and I talked to him about TS (Tourette Syndrome)."
7331,"I sought therapy, medicine, spirituality, and friends and community to cure myself."
7332,I've stopped going to therapy and am tapering off my anti-depressants.
7333,I'm working hard every day with a great therapist and lifestyle changes to fight everything.
7334,"I cannot afford to waste any more money, since I spent all my savings on a trade school (massage therapy) that is no longer relevant because of tendinitis from not taking proper care of myself/overworking at the start and horrible eczema."
7335,I have been to therapy for all of my issues since I was 12.
7336,"I was also hospitalized in Jan after a suicide attempt, followed by an intensive, outpatient, two month therapy program (group) from this feb-mar."
7337,"I continue to see a therapist weekly, although with bare bones state insurance, my options are highly limited."
7338,My doctor prescribed psychotherapy.
7339,"Either way, I don't have the time to see a therapist."
7340,My program is way too demanding and I don't have the sort of money to pay for therapist either.
7341,Are their medications/ therapy that have helped?
7342,"I know I should have been looking for an another psychiatrist and starting CBT therapy or something, but it's not so easy in my country and actually I thought that I can make it on my own, I just need to develop a good, stress-free mindset and I'll be OK. Well, I am better and now I'm trying to find my calling, or an easy stress-free job, but I still have really bad social anxiety and recurring bad feelings."
7343,"* taken medication in the past, didn't help, doing group therapy now

For a more detailed descption see here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/2evgdc/dragging_ones_self_through_life_5_steps_forward_4/

Most people with social anxiety self describe themselves as introverted."
7344,In the group therapy sessions I'm in I find I'm one of 2 or 3 people who is always talking.
7345,"This week, I suggested he see a therapist and told him I could give him resources for finding the right one, if he wanted."
7346,"He asked if there were therapists that specialized in issues of ""time management."""
7347,"I've been seeing a therapist for  the past weeks (really, for years but just a few weeks with this new one) and my therapist is suggesting I see a psychiatrist to get on some medications."
7348,My therapist says I would really benefit from it.
7349,"But yeah, therapy is nothing like I imagined, and I have noticed a big difference over only two sessions (up and down like a yoyo, but still an overall improvement)."
7350,I have been in talk therapy for years and years.
7351,I was in therapy for years from ages 8 to 16 as we tried to deal with one very specific symptom of my anxiety (my inability to go to school or complete work without feeling disproportionately overwhelmed).
7352,Went to the doc and therapist.
7353,"i started therapy a few months ago and it's been working, but those two days made it seem like i could be 'normal' and when i didn't have such a great day today i suddenly felt disheartened and angry at myself."
7354,I'm not on any medication but I have talked to therapist for awhile about it and my chronic worrying.
7355,"I'm attempting to see a therapist but I'm curious to see if anyone else has this problem, I don't think I've heard of it before."
7356,I had an interesting talk with my therapist about worrying about physical symptoms of anxiety.
7357,"I've been seeing my current therapist regularly for over three months now, and I don't trust or talk to her any more than I did that first day."
7358,"Long story short, I reacted the exact same way with the female counselor I worked with years ago; meanwhile, I recently had to meet with a psychologist and a psychiatrist (both male) and I was more honest with them within ten minutes than I've been after three months of working with my therapist."
7359,"And that means I have to tell her why, otherwise I'll probably get put with another female therapist."
7360,I've been on a variety of SSRIs and talked to therapists but I am currently off of any medication or therapy.
7361,Should I try and seek therapy again?
7362,"I go to the gym several days a week, see a therapist and am about to begin taking antidepressants."
7363,"the only thought that comes into my mind is ""it wasn't that big"" 

For example i think about the fact that i went to therapy and talked about  lot of painful memories .....and i then i think ""it wasn't that big""

Therapy helped me to build up a lot of confidence to join a SA support group and take up jogging (it helps !!)"
7364,"The most they can do is just tell me to see a therapist, which I can't afford."
7365,"Currently in the process of finding therapy for an (doctor's words:) ""unspecified mood disorder"" and coping mechanisms."
7366,"Since I'm on my way to (hopefully) regular and consistent therapy, is there anything I can do to tide myself over until then?"
7367,"I've been seeing a therapist at my university for a few months now and today we went through a very interesting, I guess you can call it, child-self reflection technique."
7368,I'm not sure what exactly my therapist called it but she wanted to try it out with me.
7369,I can't put my finger on how I really felt after this therapy technique.
7370,If anyone has ever experienced this technique in therapy it'd be nice to know how you managed it and if it was helpful or a trigger bringing you back to your past?
7371,"I done it by exposure therapy - talking to random people at all possible public places, my fear finally gone forever and I became very social and confident person first time in my life."
7372,I think I need to see a therapist about my anxiety.
7373,But the problem is that I have too much anxiety to see a therapist.
7374,"I know I should see a therapist, but I can't summon the willpower to make an appointment and show up."
7375,"Therapy just helps me put it into perspective that what I'm anxious about doesn't matter, but right now it feels like it does and if I let it go it's just going to hurt or I'm just going to stop feeling things like I think I have been since I've been in therapy."
7376,"I have been getting over the phone CBT therapy, but I can't seem to get past this brick wall when I draw or do something productive."
7377,"She seems to feel much better with medicine and talking with therapist, and we're talking more after many months of a lot of stress, but it's only been about a week and a half since she's been on Paxil."
7378,"I've been to therapy before, but the person I saw was just starting her practice and avoided talking about issues from my childhood (which I always felt contributed to my anxiety)."
7379,"Last month, I finally got new insurance from work and was able to choose a different therapist."
7380,"The most recent doctor I saw diagnosed me with anxiety, so I've been seeing a therapist for ten weeks who has helped me, in that the attacks have become less frequent."
7381,I have been wanting to see a therapist for many many years but I fear they think im an attention seeker.
7382,"For almost the past decade I have gone through CBT, COUNTLESS therapists, a residential stay in a psych ward for 2 weeks on two separate occasions, you name it I've tried just about everything."
7383,"First off, I don't think it'd be accurate to say I have chronic anxiety, as I've been to school therapists for various things, and that hasn't come up (most of those appointments were school related, like for procrastination, etc.)."
7384,"Disclaimer: I'm not a therapist or have any medical license, so if your therapist says otherwise, you ought to follow his/her counsel, and please correct me, as I probably need the help, too."
7385,"I've seen multiple therapists, tried various medications."
7386,"I do see a therapist, but it hasn't been helping, if anything it just gets me more and more frustrated, more and more anxious thinking about the future and the past."
7387,"(I can do math the next morning, couldn't after taking a Xanax to sleep)

I know you can go to some shady fly by night doctor and get a script in DC, but I'd rather find a psychiatrist who I will actually see on an ongoing basis, who is supportive of me wanting to take whatever medicine helps me best, and who can liase with a therapists in the same practice."
7388,"For months i've been telling myself that I will go into therapy, that I will exercise, that I will drink water, that I will quit drinking, that I will diet, that I will meditate."
7389,I got put on a 10mg/day Celexa and started receiving cognitive behavioral therapy about two months ago.
7390,Basically the only thing therapy helped me to realize is that I am not going crazy and that I am experiencing a heightened state of anxiety due to my brain going through a transition into early adulthood.
7391,"I can't live the rest of my life feeling like this...

TL;DR: Got diagnosed GAD, therapy+medicine didnt help, cant deal with endless dissociation, derealization, negative feelings of detachment and paranoia, becoming depressed, dont know what to take/do"
7392,"Besides therapy, did you do anything else that made a difference?"
7393,I think I need to see a therapist.
7394,"My girlfriend has been dealing with SAD even before we began dating (she is currently seeing a therapist), and it's gotten me worried."
7395,I have not yet seen a therapist but I only want to do that if everything else fails.
7396,I am seeing a therapist but I've only seen her twice in the past 4 weeks because she's been out of the office.
7397,"I wish I had medication or SOMETHING to help me cope but I have nothing except for SI, which is how I used to cope, but my therapist doesn't want me doing that anymore."
7398,I opened up to my therapist but he told my psychiatrist and I feel betrayed.
7399,I have been in therapy for anxiety for 14 weeks now and I have been able to control my day-to-day anxieties quite easily lately so I know this is different.
7400,"I've been seeing my therapist for a year or so, and he is fantastic."
7401,"So, I emailed my therapist yesterday evening and told him the situation, and just said, basically, ""I hate to disturb you, but if you get this and have time to reply, do you think I'm overreacting, and do you think I can do this?"""
7402,"Did ok Thursday night, Friday went fairly well...got a massage (we have a massage therapy school that does 50 minutes for $25, joy!)"
7403,Currently I am seeing a therapist and I’m on 15mg of Escitalopram per day.
7404,"I see the doctor on Wednesday and I want to increase the dose to at least 20mg because, as I keep telling my therapist in virtually every session, “I’m just not in a good place.” Lately I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t even feel like eating—even when my body is telling me that I am hungry."
7405,As I got older my anxiety just got worse and worse and by the time I was in 1st grade I went through a number of therapists and nothing scared me more than thinking I was a broken human being and that something was severely wrong with me So I lied to my therapist so I didn't have to see them anymore and I lied to my parents so they wouldn't be disappointed in having a worthless son (my mentality in 1st grade was pretty bleak but I remember that exaxt feeling clear as day.)
7406,"I'm already seeing a weekly therapist, and I've tried meditating before bed."
7407,And he makes a fuss about me going to therapy.
7408,"He also referred me to a therapist, who will call next week."
7409,I feel like I've tried enough drug and non-drug therapies that something should have worked by now.
7410,I've gone to therapy once or twice when I was 8 then another time when I was 13-14 when a rumor spread in school that I was suicidal.
7411,He started therapy around that time and they had their suspicions I'm guessing but it wasn't until he was 13 that they started medicating him and requiring him to go see his psychiatrist 1-2x a week.
7412,I'm terrified of going to a therapist of any sort because they've never worked with me and most seemed so self-righteous that they only made me feel worse.
7413,"I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place here so any recommendations from you guys would be greatly appreciated, obviously I'll talk it over with my therapist and doctor before I do anything, but any advice would be grand."
7414,"I went to go see my nurse practitioner today, who prescribes me my Zoloft, and I told her point-blank that I have been trying to get an appointment for therapy since November and that no one was cooperating."
7415,Just wondering if anyone has gone through therapy for anxiety or depression and initially experienced adverse effects?
7416,What I mean by this is- feeling overwhelmed by the feedback you're getting from the therapist.
7417,I am on medications  (although I hate to be) and see a therapist weekly.
7418,"I've had lots of help in the past with meds and therapy while in HS and college, but nothing has really helped long term except for Welbutrin (which only keeps me from sleeping all day)."
7419,"I went through 8 years of therapy, I feel as though I have tools to keep my lid mostly on.. And if I ever make the decision to take it again, I'm open to that."
7420,"2nd book: Don't Panic by Dr. Reid Wilson 
This book was recommended by most recent therapist and exposed me to the craziest though."
7421,"I've tried reading self help books, meditation, hypnotizing myself,
and even saw a therapist for one session."
7422,"I haven't been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but all of those who I confide in say that I should probably talk to a therapist (that costs $$, which I don't have and is the main thing I stress about)."
7423,"I am seeing a therapist before anyone asks, but he's so expensive."
7424,Because the therapist I'm seeing is the most helpful one I've ever seen and I just had this feeling that if I sought anyone else out I wouldn't be satisfied anyway.
7425,So I can't afford going to the therapist that may have saved my life.
7426,I miss when i was in the USA :( at least i had a therapist and meds there while here my dad wanna take me to what equivalent of exorcism.
7427,"And if I'm anxious about schiz.. Will that get me the illness 


Too bad there is only 1 therapist in my small city and he has rlly bad reputation 


Plz help me 

I lost my appetite and i feel lightheaded a lot and tension in my neck 

Im 18 and I just graduated high school with rlly good grades and I missed singing up for college because of this anxiety .. God mercy on me 

There is no one that has schiz in my family but only my moms cousin 

And inever used any hallucination drugs or marijuana  I only used medications because I had an injury in my knee like 3 years ago 

My child hood was nice and my parents barley fought but my high school was quite bad because I injuried my knee and withdrawed from sports and I started playing videos games and sit at home most of my team and I was quite sad because I injuried my self and I couldn't workout on my body anymore"
7428,"I have gone to a therapist three times, as afterwards I was leaving the country for two months and when I was back, she was no longer working at our clinic."
7429,"This made me think of my own experience in therapy, where I am slowly learning to manage my anxiety by letting go of my need to be in control of everything- the solution was not, as I had hoped, to learn how to control everything better, but rather to let control fall to the side."
7430,"She's the reason for probably 70% of my panic attacks, but she never acknowledges that it's her fault, so she just sticks me in therapy until I learn to cope with her irrational anger."
7431,"If she triggers an attack in me now, she yells at me afterwards for obviously not working hard enough in therapy."
7432,"I have been seeing my GP and a therapist (LISW), but my therapist's office also has a psychiatrist (MD) on staff."
7433,I left a message today with a CBT therapist but I doubt they will call back any time before the new year.
7434,"I've done, yoga, meditation, square breathing, pursed lipped breathing, intense cardio, therapy, benzos, the list goes on."
7435,"My last major panic attack was at the end of February, and I've been doing much better since then: I'm in counseling, and have even managed to go from weekly sessions with my therapist to seeing her every other week (or sometimes monthly)."
7436,":( I'm not scheduled to see my therapist again until the first week of September, but I may call and see if I can get in before then."
7437,I was wondering if this will go away once I complete therapy?
7438,"Thankfully, over the summer I started going back to therapy and taking an anti-depressant, which has for the most part kept the most severe aspects of my depression under control."
7439,"I've tried therapy, but it isn't that helpful."
7440,"Also, I can't afford therapy at the moment, otherwise I would go back."
7441,"I suppose this is kinda for my own step for recovery, but i'll always promised myself that i'd be as open as possible about going to therapy and share my story in the hope to help  lift the stigma around mental health (which is kinda big in here in Ireland)  

So i've started to take some steps towards doing that, theres a workshop due to go ahead in a town close to me later on this Summer, so i want to go there and just share everything (well almost, they dont need to hear the gory stuff) 

anyway i'm about to take one hell of a step for me, so i'm putting it out here so that future anxious me and re-read it and get his nerves back"
7442,I've scheduled an appointment with a therapist and a psychologist this week to see which is a better fit for me.
7443,I spoke to my therapist about it and she said it could be purely physical - a result of my body working overtime in the heat.
7444,I've started doing it so I can see a therapist or something and show them this.
7445,"I've got my sleepytime tea, my green tea, my good-smelling air wick to plug in next to my bed, my swimming regime and a plan that is approved by my doctors and my therapist to conquer anxiety."
7446,I'm looking for a good therapist or somebody who can really help me.
7447,I'm wondering if anybody had any personal and positive experiences with a therapist in LA?
7448,Anyone have any suggestions for medication or therapy to help overcome them?
7449,"I do think it's bad that I diagnose myself, but seeing as how somatic disorders are in some grey area between psychological therapy and regular medicine, it's been very hard for me to get any help."
7450,"Social anxiety and depression, transferred colleges due to bullying, bullying aggravated social anxiety and depression, then went to therapist who ignored my very serious systems and tried to do conversion therapy on me without informed consent or explanation."
7451,So I decided to look into therapy.
7452,"I am in therapy and take Ativan as needed, but it's been a lot more since this symptom has came to be."
7453,I've been to doctors and therapists and nothing seems to work.
7454,"I'm going back to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist in a couple weeks, I'm going to try meds because nothing is working and I seriously can't live like this."
7455,I'm on medication and getting therapy and I can honestly say I feel like a different person and those mistakes are all in the past
7456,"I finally took the step of seeing a therapist, but couldn't go too often because it costs more than I could ever afford (I'm very grateful my parents are willing to still pay for it)."
7457,"My therapy has been quite helpful so far, but the struggle is still way too real."
7458,I am a therapist in Austin and I wrote a blog post on nervousness and anxiety.
7459,I think I remember reading that it's quite difficult to treat and therapy/drug treatment usually only has a 50% success rate.
7460,Did you go to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) before you got medication?
7461,How soon into therapy did you get put on medication?
7462,I'm currently about a month into CBT and at today's session my therapist recommended I go on meds.
7463,Okay so I know I should probably get a professional opinion on this but I can't afford to go to a therapist and I can't bring myself to ask my parents to send me to one.
7464,"And more importantly, do you guys think I have a real social anxiety and I should consider seeing a therapist; or am I just immature and shy and should do as my parents/friends say and 'get over it'?"
7465,"Before I start, I want to preface this with the fact that I, myself, have gone to therapy (and still continue to go, though less frequently) for anxiety."
7466,"I have suggested for her to return to therapy, but she dismisses it due to financial problems (which I also hear about daily)."
7467,"With that said, I'm a broke college student, so full-blown therapy wouldn't be feasible too :/"
7468,Should I go see a therapist?
7469,"Edit: I was screened by a therapist at student health, and referred to a community specialist for OCD."
7470,I know I am sick as wouldn't have all these appointments and therapy sessions and I certainly wouldn't be starting meds if I wasn't.
7471,I spoke to the doctor and my therapist about these feelings breifly and they reassured me to try the medication and see how my progress goes while continuing therapy.
7472,"I'm currently seeing a therapist (second day on Tuesday) and we haven't really discussed the notion that I believe I have anxiety attacks but I did briefly touch on the notion that I cannot, no matter how hard I try, I cannot take something off my mind."
7473,I'm hoping a therapist can help me help get through this.
7474,I'm currently seeing a therapist and it's helping a bit but I really suck at studying.
7475,I think i would as I have been on medication before and am seeing a therapist.
7476,"Ever since then, she's been telling me to see a therapist, but to do that I'd have to tell my parents and family, and I'm not comfortable doing that, I just can't."
7477,"I also do therapy (cbt, etc) and I stink at interrupting my thoughts."
7478,"My psychiatrist told me to cut down to 5mg after 4 days, but my therapist told me I should wait longer (which would you guys suggest from personal experience?)."
7479,"I've been doing exposure therapy with a therapist, and that is helping."
7480,I was so frustrated with myself as I would practice exposure therapy for months and got NOWHERE.
7481,"In the meantime, I'm trying to figure out how to have one of our three cats certified as a therapy animal."
7482,Um... tl;dr: Does anyone know anything about having an animal/pet certified as a therapy animal/pet?
7483,"My family has all sorts of mental problems - my brother is diagnosed bipolar, yet refuses to go to therapy or take medication for it."
7484,"My mother has severe anxiety and depression issues, but refuses therapy - although she does take an SSRI."
7485,I feel sometimes judged and looked down on in my family for doing therapy and now medication at all - but at the same time I'm the *only fucking one* in the family that seems to actually be seeking help to overcome this.
7486,"What I've been doing for the past six months:

* Weekly group therapy with a process group (described [here](http://www.uhs.wisc.edu/services/counseling/group-counseling/process.shtml))
* Individual therapy every other week
* Daily meditation
* Muscle relaxation exercises
* Meds (SSRI, Prazosin for nightmares, Ativan on hand just in case)
* Cardio exercise
* Taking care of medical problems that exacerbate my anxiety (ulcerative colitis, mostly)
* Not smoking pot anymore, trying to reduce my alcohol intake
* Generally trying to communicate better, including being open with my spouse, friends, and family about my anxiety

In combination these have made me feel significantly better, like I'm 75% there."
7487,I have GAD and have been to therapy in the past.
7488,"I cannot go to therapy, because I work at the only mental health center local to me, and the stress that would cause between me and my fellow therapists would be unbearable, so I have been looking into online therapies."
7489,Should I try a real life therapist?
7490,She started therapy with a nice lady that we found through her insurance.
7491,"I just don't know what to do, I think i should talk to a therapist or get some medication."
7492,"I'm in therapy but not currently on medication, as most of them seemed to make it worse and according to two different psychiatrists I've tried just about all the medication options."
7493,I should also at this point note that I have been seeing a therapist.
7494,"The therapist has pointed out that she is still with me, that I need to tell myself these are all just thoughts, that I need to stop thinking about all the ""what ifs"" because those are all just thoughts."
7495,But I can't afford a therapist visit at the moment.
7496,Like the title says I am looking for recommendations for a doctor who specializes in Cognitive behavioral therapy.
7497,"I'm starting therapy in a few months but it just seems too far away, I don't want another year where I cannot speak to somebody outside of work, how would I go about getting friends I can hang out with outside of work?"
7498,"I still don't want to see a psychologist, but I can't keep dumping my problems on my boyfriend like he's a therapist, I know it's going to strain our relationship."
7499,"I've had my anxiety under control for the past year (thanks to acupuncture, therapy cat, and you guys) until a few days ago."
7500,She also suggested therapy.
7501,"I personally cannot imagine ever being able to go to therapy, although they are not there to judge you, imo, everyone judges everyone and putting myself in a situation where someone is hearing the things I want no one else to hear, and judging me on those things, I can't even explain how that makes me feel."
7502,At the moment I'm not seeing a therapist however I am taking 50mg Zoloft daily and have been for around 2 months now.
7503,I've been trying various medications and therapies since I was 13 years old.
7504,My first session (in over 10 years) with a therapist is this afternoon at 3.
7505,I just started therapy after 10 years of what I now realize is anxiety.
7506,"Part of it is for self-therapy and another part is for everyone else who struggles with disorders like Anxiety, OCD, Depression, Bi-polar, etc."
7507,"I saw a therapist a handful of times and then that was that... Never really encouraged to do anything else, so I just sort of accepted that medication was what I needed and I took it faithfully until the end of last year - so for about a total of 15 years."
7508,Since January I've been weaning myself off while also seeing a therapist who does CBT and is helping me.
7509,"I'm gradually weaning myself off Celexa, I've been seeing a therapist and practicing CBT, going to the gym, learning to let go, etc, etc."
7510,I've tried therapy and I find myself just BSing and saying what I think the person wants to hear because I'm afraid of frustrating them or sounding crazy.
7511,"I can't be doing this every night for three months, and therapy/drugs/he can only do so much."
7512,"After this mornings therapy session, we decided to bump my current Paxil dosage from 20mg to 30mg daily."
7513,"My therapist and I quizzically raised an eyebrow to the ""poor SSRI"" response, as it's clear over the years that SSRI's have significantly helped me - SNRI's turned me into an angry rage monster (I wasn't depressed though!"
7514,I am going full-time therapy.
7515,"""I'm not trained for this, this is why i gave you the therapists number"", is how she justifies her behavior, even though im trying to tell her how to help me."
7516,"Iv been through years of therapy for depression and drug problems, with no idea what the hell was wrong with me."
7517,"""After a long time with therapy and finding the correct medication, maybe I can be like that"" I say to myself."
7518,And to someone with anxiety even picking up the phone and having a 30 second conversation to schedule an appointment with a therapist is risky.
7519,"On September 3rd, I went to the doctor, spilled everything, and got a prescription for citalopram and my first therapy appointment scheduled a couple of weeks out."
7520,We decided to stick with just therapy and not try another pill just yet.
7521,"I've been in therapy for ten weeks and I thought I was doing great, but I had another major panic attack at the beginning of this week and I still feel unstable."
7522,"In therapy, we've barely touched on the stuff that drove me to seek help in the first place."
7523,It's just been me and my therapist trying to deal with the trauma of what happened with the meds.
7524,I never considered going to a therapist.
7525,My parents cared but didn’t know how to help and I think they had negative feeling about therapists and the like so I never saw a professional.
7526,Every day I tell myself that I need to see a therapist but I keep trying to white knuckle it anyway.
7527,I have an initial 90 minute appointment with a therapist tomorrow and I'm struggling to articulate my thoughts into something coherent.
7528,I'm hoping that therapy will help me to reach that place.
7529,"So he ended up being like my therapist , in a weird way ."
7530,"And he would tell me to get a therapist , like , I did want to and I am now seeing one ."
7531,When I suggested couples therapy he said he didn't know if things would change ...
7532,I just need to make it to tomorrow where i have an appointment with my therapist.
7533,I'm in therapy but I'm not seeing her until Wednesday morning and I have another date on Tuesday night.
7534,I'm not diagnosed with any disorders or anything nor am I in therapy.
7535,I had my first therapy session after a months break today and I just feel stuck.
7536,The therapist I have is fantastic and I feel shitty because I am coming to her every time with a new anxiety that's cropped up.
7537,I am seeing a therapist currently but it isn't helping.
7538,"Through a combination of cognitive behavior therapy and a (now gone) as-needed Alprazolam prescription, I've managed pretty well over the last few years (very grateful not to have landed myself in the hospital with my attacks in a while)."
7539,"The appointment I was told (by reception, who now says he said no such thing) would be 9 am today was a therapist no show."
7540,I was supposed to meet my therapist for the first time and do a treatment plan (in under 30 minutes).
7541,"Apparently therapy was pre-empted by therapist training, and ."
7542,I'm also hesitant to the idea of therapy.
7543,"Whenever I've been to therapy as a teen, it always seemed like I was just being evaluated to see which medication I needed to be put onto."
7544,"Because it appears to be subconcious, my numerous bouts of therapy and CBT have done nothing so I've resorted to trying medication."
7545,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
7546,So i have panic disorder since 2006.Things were ok since i didnt have so much agoraphobia in the beginning.But now i am unable to go anywhere without some company.I dont know what to do since i dont have the guts to face this fear.I know that a panic attack wont kill me but i am still so afraid of it happening in the middle of the street away from home.As a result of this i cant have a relationship or job and i am 34y.o.I really dont know what to do.Meds are not helping.I am on cipralex and tried 4 5 other different antidepressants.I tried some exposure therapy with a psychologist and it was easy when we walked together.But when he left me alone i had difficult time and i was too afraid of a panic attack.I am sick of this condition thats killing my life but i dont have the courage to face this.Any help?
7547,"So last Thursday I was in the er with my first anxiety attack, I went to the doctor Monday and she confirmed that I am physically healthy, and I started therapy on Tuesday."
7548,"When we were speaking yesterday, after a long chat, my therapist told me that what i really need and it could help me a lot is to have a girlfriend."
7549,Let me preface by saying that I never have missed a therapy appointment without calling first EVER.
7550,My therapist is nice enough to see me on a sliding scale that probably isn't even worth her time for what I pay for.
7551,We tried EMDR therapy for a while but we couldn't get it to work and I feel like ever since then I've been hopeless on ever feeling like a real person and a time waster.
7552,"It's something I've experienced since childhood, through school, and at other jobs but have never been able to quite put into words so it's made it difficult to talk to my parents/therapists about it."
7553,"I see a psychiatrist, and a therapist now and then, but with this it even feels like relaxing techniques can't help."
7554,My therapists over the years have taught me a few useful skills.
7555,I was skeptical of my therapists' ability to help me.
7556,"Here are some things that work for me as an example:

- Chewing gum
- Playing an instrument
- Going outside
- Cold water applied to the face
- Cold temperatures in general
- Cooking
- Yoga/Meditation
- Ice packs on neck
- Deep breaths / breathing techniques
- Sports
- Stretching
- Sex/Masturbation/Cuddling
- Checking five senses (""I ask myself if I can see, taste, smell, touch, hear any danger"")
- Eating peppermint or cinnamon candy
- Rub palms together firmly
- Tap feet on the ground
- Grasp chair arms or make fists
- Clean the house
- Talk to someone
- Drink a beer or wine
- Reading out loud
- Blowing bubbles
- Relaxation melodies
- Aroma therapy
- Medical Marihuana
- Whistling away to oneself
- Singing
- Listening to uplifting music
- Walking back and forth
- Take a shower (sit on the floor rocking if you must)
- Watch funny/distracting shows
- Blowing up a balloon

(I'll keep this updated whenever I find something new that worked and from your comments)"
7557,It hasn't been diagnosed as any type of disorder yet buy my current therapist is starting to consider it one.
7558,She doesn't want to tell her parents and I don't want to straight out tell her to go see a therapist.
7559,"I've been seeing a therapist for almost two years now, and it doesn't seem to be helping at all."
7560,"I don't really feel like the therapy has made me worse, just that it hasn't helped me get better or even kept me from getting worse."
7561,"I don't know if it's my fault, or my therapist's."
7562,"Am I not ""doing therapy right""?"
7563,"In general terms, what should a typical therapy session be like and how is it supposed to help the patient?"
7564,"I have seen two therapists/psychologists, but have since discontinued therapy."
7565,"It's a type of therapy, Google it if you wish."
7566,"I suppose I could bear it until I get a car next year...

On the other hand, doing the therapy is better than my current plan."
7567,"Fuck, I just don't want to waste what little energy I do have on this therapy, and then have it just not work or make me even more anxious."
7568,"I talked to my mom about it and she made an appointement with the best therapist for adolescants in my city, but that is in january."
7569,Did therapy work for any of you?
7570,If i were to tell them they might want to ask me questions and make me go to therapy.
7571,Plus I don't want my family wasting money on therapy or me seeing a doctor.
7572,"I started seeing a therapist, and making small steps to not being anxious/depressed 24/7."
7573,"I really think I need to talk to a therapist, and I found one covered by my insurance that seems perfect for how I'm feeling, but I am having so much trouble calling for an appointment."
7574,I took Zoloft for it and went and saw a therapist when I was first diagnosed.
7575,"Recent grad, working a temp-to-hire position that doesn't offer insurance, and while i do have insurance it's already expensive and goddamnit I'm sick of therapists."
7576,"I have also spoken to my therapist about this, whom I was seeing already for some older issues that have been resolved now."
7577,I was told by my therapist to try and apply for a few jobs and just see.
7578,"I need to overcome this though because if I go back to my therapist in three weeks and have to say I couldn't do it, I will feel I have failed terribly."
7579,"I've been in therapy with several therapists due to a few moves, all the way from 2007, and so it pains me I am still not better."
7580,"BUT

I'm also in therapy, which has really helped me cope."
7581,I would highly recommend going to a CBT therapist if you can afford it.
7582,"Remember that therapists will work with what you can pay, you can space out sessions as little or often as you can afford."
7583,"Again, there are loads of lovely guided meditations for free on YouTube, I love [The Honest Guys'](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheHonestGuys) channel :)

**Emotional Freedom Technique** - A few years ago a therapist thought me this odd tapping technique called EFT."
7584,I see a therapist and a psychiatrist regularly.
7585,All this made me nuts and for as much as I want/ed to go to a therapist I could only imagine saying my true feelings and them thinking I am nuts and locking me up.
7586,"I've never been on medication, although I have had a therapist off and on."
7587,"3 therapists, 4th psychiatrist."
7588,"I have seen my primary care doctor, am working in setting up physical therapy for problems that prevent me from doing yoga but I'm having insurance issues."
7589,I feel i should talk to a therapist or someone of that nature about my issues.
7590,"I brought up the idea of having a therapist but they only laughed at it and said, ""its for mental asylum patients""."
7591,"I was *supposed* to schedule another follow-up appointment, as well as take it with therapy, but my jackass dad cut my insurance (thanks pops) so I just had to wean myself off."
7592,"i've been trying super hard to be more supportive to myself through positive self talk, the only way i can do it, is to compare where i was a few years ago  to where i am now 

basically going from days where i was sitting alone crying (and not knowing why)  to today where i'm doing okay....ish 

But as much has I try to be more positive with myself, it just doesn't stick, its like i've got some sort of force field that kicks into action as soon as i try to ""be kinder to myself "" (that still confuses me, even in therapy, i'm told ""be kind to yourself"" and i'm sitting there thinking ""WTF does that even mean ?"""
7593,"Before anyone asks, yes, I am also scheduling appointments with a therapist and psychiatrist, so I'm not just taking your word for it."
7594,"I'm sick of meds that don't work, therapy that doesn't help, coping strategies that don't help me cope."
7595,"I can't talk to my mom because she denies every problem I have, and I can't go to a therapist because I don't have the time, and it makes my anxiety much worse."
7596,I'm seeing a therapist tomorrow.
7597,I've been seeing a counselor/therapist for a few months.
7598,"I could barely function today because I got worked up before going in and could not shake it, even with the breathing exercise I've been working on with the new therapist."
7599,I have been trying various ways to cope with it for the past two years (including therapy but not drugs) and I now feel like progress simply doesn't exist because even the thought of beating my anxiety causes anxiety.
7600,"Went to therapy for a few months, which helped a little bit, but then I started seeing a psychiatrist about 9 months ago who prescribed Zoloft (25mg/day) and Klonopin (.125 - .25mg to take as needed)."
7601,My film is about a guy with social anxiety who alongside another group therapy member runs away to complete a list of rom com cliches.
7602,I am interested in bibliotherapy [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotherapy] as a way to cope with and manage symptoms.
7603,"I would like recommendations from others to add to my ""bibliotherapy"" reading list."
7604,I am not medicated and would prefer not to be dependent on medication but have always been open to therapy.
7605,I know in the back of my mind seeing a therapist would be helpful but I can't afford it on a college budget.
7606,I've been talking to my therapist and have pinpointed a few stressors that may be contributing to the problem.
7607,"I had managed this with my depression in the past, and when I started going to the therapy sessions and taking the medication I thought this would be the exact same thing."
7608,"I stopped going to the therapy sessions a couple weeks ago (partly due to the costs, also because the therapist called me the wrong name in our last session I'm almost certain), and the Buspar is only helping minimally."
7609,They tried to send me off to therapy.
7610,"I mean yeah, I've have panic attacks, I've self harmed, I've had suicidal thoughts, I've been to therapy."
7611,"I contacted a therapist a few days ago and I have a session next week, I'm hoping this could maybe be a start to sorting myself out."
7612,"I have started counselling a few weeks ago, and my therapist can tell that I am not opening up, and I am also finding it hard to tell her everything she'll need to help me get through this."
7613,"**Edit: I probably should have included this:**

I have an appointment with my doctor this Wednesday, which is a pre-requisite to getting a therapist/psychologist."
7614,"I am currently seeing a therapist about all the anxiety, depression and insomnia I have."
7615,"I am already seeing a therapist in my school, she's helping me to cope with my failures somewhat but my academics are not improving fast enough for me to feel good about it."
7616,"As for going to my GP, who I know quite well, I fear he would instantly see how far I have dropped and prescribe me medication ,therapy etc."
7617,Currently in therapy and taking meds for depression.
7618,"I was already in therapy for depression for about a year, but I never thought I had a problem with obsessions until just a few months ago."
7619,"Anyway, I talked to both my therapist and school counselor."
7620,"I have gone to therapy on and off for the last 5 years with various different therapists and types of therapy, and tried 4 different medications, but none have worked."
7621,"I have no idea if I can get help for this, because I have never heard of anyone seeking help with a shrink or therapist."
7622,"I have finally made the decision to try to get an appointment with a therapist, psychologist, whoever..."
7623,I won't have the time to see a therapist or whoever.
7624,I'm in therapy.
7625,"I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder about five years ago, but have not seen a therapist at all."
7626,"I immediately started searching for a therapist in my town, fortunately I found one and called her the next day."
7627,"From the day I first called my therapist I was committed to do whatever it takes to get better, and with professional help I really feel I got much better."
7628,The recommendation of the guy who worked with me was to find a therapist to work through and it to consider medication as a stop gap.
7629,I was offered CBT therapy at one point early on but I refused it as I dident want to get involved in therapy for some reason I cant explain but every time I have gone back since then to try and request it they have brushed me off.
7630,I have been working with a therapist and the other week she said that she think I may have a mood disorder.
7631,"I am taking meds due to the constant anxiety, and going to therapy (so are the kids)."
7632,"I want to be supportive and help her, but I don't even know how to bring up the issue without causing even more anxiety; anxiety that I'll leave her, anxiety that she's anxious, anxiety about what a professional therapist might say if she sees one."
7633,It took some time I finally figured out that I was suffering from Anxiety Disorder and it took sometime until I got myself into doing a therapy.
7634,"For those who are interested, I am doing a concentrative movement therapy ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrative_movement_therapy ) it's not so common as like CBT for example, also takes a lot more time, but seems to be a lot more in dept and more permanently."
7635,Then it was a lot of physiotherapy and getting fit again.
7636,"I believe it was this kind of catastrophe which made me realize things and changed my mind, but I also think the therapy (which I am still doing on a weekly base) had a lot of impact."
7637,"I really want to get help for my anxiety and see a therapist, but I'm 18 and I don't have insurance or a job."
7638,I recently got to ask Sanjay Gupta in his AMA about this (you can see full comments in my history) and he agreed with me that taking marijuana high in CBD combined with therapy is effective and much safer than drugs such as Prozac or Xanax.
7639,"I'm looking for help again, but I'm open to exploring different therapy options since my therapist moved and money is tight."
7640,The Military doc I am seeing now wants to admit me for 30 days of inpatient therapy.
7641,"I have a doctor's appt this Friday to get some blood work done because my therapist wants to test me for a hyperactive thyroid and my vitamin B, A and D levels."
7642,"Like I said earlier, I tried therapy for about four months and I feel like I made NO progress what so ever."
7643,"Footnote info: I'm 20F, been on 200mg of Setraline (I get generic Zoloft) since I was about twelve-thirteen (it started low and gradually increased to the same as my Mom who also has anxiety), haven't seen a therapist/psychiatrist/etc since diagnosis (went for 6m-a year according to my mother (I have very little memory of going to therapy other than once, to be honest) and was under the care of the doctor who had known me since I was little."
7644,So anyways recently I was seeing my therapist who's been amazing.
7645,"In particular I'd like to know if SSRIs and MAO inhibitors treat the actual root cause of anxiety disorder, or if they merely numb the symptoms until the results of cognitive therapy show effect."
7646,but i finally decided to seek a therapist.
7647,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
7648,She's recommend I see a therapist.
7649,"After years of not wanting to see a therapist due to a bad experience with her old therapist (he wasn't even certified but we didn't know), she's asked me to make an appointment for her."
7650,"So far, I have just been leaving voicemails and asking potential therapists to call me back."
7651,"I just started this job so I don't have insurance yet, nor can I just take a sick day and go to a therapist or something."
7652,Those damn therapists have really lazy hours.
7653,I'm 15 and have been going to therapy for GAD and also some issues with depression since I was 10.
7654,"When I tell her it's not just a ""hard time"" im going through, that it's a legitimate mental disorder that I have been working vary hard with my doctors and therapist to manage she accuses me of blowing things out of proportion and try to make it into some ""grand thing""."
7655,I have a very supportive girlfriend and I see my doc and a therapist.
7656,"i have very bad ocd which leads to terrible anxiety, i have intrusive thoughts which tell me ridiculous things that make me freak out which results me in doing constant self affirmations that says it isn't true, which leads to my intrusive thoughts making me say the wrong things that i wanna say, for instance right now i know this is crazy, but it's making me think that manti te'o's face is my face and that i can't stop my self from freaking out that i don't have my face or that im going to look like him, and i've been doing this affirmation thing i picked up along time ago that is terrible for me, but i bascially say ""i am using all of my will to ensure i don't look like this person"" and i just keep saying the wrong thing that makes me say the complete opposite, and i start freaking out cause i think i messed up, and it ruins my entire day cause i spend the entire day just trying to get my self to normality in knowing that i only look like my self or that im not ugly, or stuff like that, i am sorry if this is random or of this doesn't seem to fit here, but i am shaking from the affirmations i've been doing, which also i feel like if i cough right after i say an affirmation it's true, and yeah, i'm just freaking out that my face is gonna start changing some how to look like someone else or to look really bad or something i know i need therapy, but i just can't get there right now and maybe this will help me feel better?"
7657,"I actually posted awhile ago about how my therapist ""graduated"" me and that I felt like I was doing so much better."
7658,I've been doing all sorts of various breathing exercises I learned in therapy.
7659,I'm writing out my feelings right now (another suggestion from therapy).
7660,"I sort of want to see a therapist, but I am not sure they will do me much good, and I do not want to be put on medication or have my family think I am crazy (thirdly, it will be expensive)."
7661,"I have been seeing a psychologist regularly (focusing on cognitive behavioral therapy), and my MD and I have tried a few Rx options."
7662,Except for the hour or so I was at my therapy appointment.
7663,I've put off getting myself checked out for so long due to my past experiences with therapy.
7664,I'm stacked with therapy and meds.
7665,"I've been seeing a therapist and while I feel I've been making strides, but last week I had a week long anxiety attack-feeling super dizzy with shaky legs."
7666,"While my therapist insists she thinks I'm getting better, I'm still worried that the physical symptoms are getting worse since I had this attack last week."
7667,"My boyfriend’s coworker suggested a hypno therapist, but I’m afraid of wasting money on something that won’t work."
7668,I'm seeing a therapist and I'm on medication.
7669,I've talked to a therapist and a GP and they were both bewildered.
7670,"Seeing as I've gone to therapy, anxiety group's and have been doing light volunteering at a local museum and other such places (once or twice a week) I now figure/want to start looking for some work (this has been a fairly big fear of mine since my last job 2 years ago)."
7671,I broke down into tears after the concert and my parents decided I needed therapy because after that day (3 months ago) I have about 6 anxiety attacks a day that usually last 30 minutes.
7672,"I've had three therapy appointments so far, and its not helping yet."
7673,I had a really bad experience in college where I had a full blown panic attack during a presentation and I had to sit down for a second and collect myself (irony was I was talking about how therapy animals can help with anxiety and panic.)
7674,"I'm totally committed to trying therapy and, if need be, medication."
7675,Going to a therapist next week...having trouble keeping my head while I wait.
7676,My therapist told me on our last session that she thinks I have been stable enough for the past year to discontinue our regular sessions and to just come as needed.
7677,"Are there a lot of cases where being treated by meds and therapy for a few years, stabilizing, and then getting off meds keeps people stable?"
7678,"So yeah, it looks i will fail the therapy because of me."
7679,"I can say with certainty that if it wasn't for ACA helping me get my medicine and proper therapy, I would not be here writing this."
7680,I'm not seeing a therapist currently but I plan to in the near future.
7681,I scheduled an appointment with a therapist.
7682,2) I have been in therapy for more than 2 years.
7683,"Considering the following:






1) Hypnotherapy for all of the irrational reasons (read: ""please erase my brain and start over)

2) Complete self destruction, by uprooting myself and moving and abandoning all ties to my current life."
7684,I can't afford therapy and I'm scared of medication.
7685,"Going to therapy is not really an option as my parents just think I am faking it/ being weak...


Any help about how I could change my current situation would be greatly appreciated."
7686,I was going to physical therapy which helped a lot but there was a slight issue with my insurance so I can't go back until after Jan. 1st.
7687,"Its funny, physical therapy to me is one of those things that don't seem like a big deal until you stop going."
7688,I am trying to get an appointment with my old therapist but I'm having issues with insurance wanting to pay for it.
7689,I hope that therapy will help me learn to manage and long with restarting my exercise routine.
7690,"I keep subtly hinting to my therapist that it's not helping, as I really struggle with expressing myself openly and honestly in person this is the best way I've been able to come up with to do it, but all he offers is more CBT sessions, saying I need to work at the activities some more."
7691,Think I definitely need to book myself into some professional therapy because self-help is not being successful yet.
7692,I'm trying to truck through and not use medication or therapy but I'm running out of ideas!
7693,"I am in therapy right now, but it is psychodynamic."
7694,I as a general rule like that but am considering if I should seek out CBT to focus on just this issue since CBT may be better for something very goal oriented while by psychodynamic therapy is more insight focused.
7695,Too bad there's not a therapist run driving school.
7696,"This is a complete first for me, and I think it might be a good sign that the therapy is finally working."
7697,I am a college student who has been seeing a therapist on campus for almost a year now.
7698,I am wondering if I should find another therapist in the meantime but am worried about having to start from scratch with a new therapist.
7699,"I'm planning on seeing a therapist, but right now I'm afraid I'm never going to feel normal again."
7700,"I'm currently in the process of finding a therapist and getting insurance, but for now, I turn to you guys an gals."
7701,My therapist/proscribe...er has gone MIA due to health issues and has basically been just neglecting me for the last year.
7702,"If I got all this info together and went to register on October 25th, I would be evaluated by a therapist and the therapist would decide if I need to see a psychiatrist, who I wouldn't be able to see for AT LEAST another month."
7703,Just the thought of having to convince a therapist that I need pills makes me want to cry.
7704,After finally getting help from a therapist.
7705,The position itself was amazing (physical therapy aide).
7706,"However, the two owners (who were also among the team of physical therapists) were the *worst* people I have ever met."
7707,Spent the next week in hospital on morphine drip and pain killers for next 4 months and physical therapy for 10 months.
7708,"He has seen a therapist at a couple of different points in our marriage, and everything is great until he stops going and it all reverts very quickly back to how it was before."
7709,"I have a lot of health anxiety, and my therapist seems to think I have some OCD--the obsession being my health, the compulsion being that I take my temperature daily, even hourly."
7710,"With all that being said, I'm really glad I took a step in the right direction to fight my anxiety by seeing a therapist."
7711,"I'm not in therapy right now but I'm starting tomorrow, weekly."
7712,"See a therapist weekly, take a handful of meds daily."
7713,"Therapy has been brought up many times, does therapy help in your experience?"
7714,"I'm a pretty large guy (6'4, 190), and a few of the therapists I've spoken to in my life have specifically told me that I need to smile more if I want to be less intimidating to strangers in social situations."
7715,I had to call my therapist at lunch to get him to calm me down.
7716,"Anyway, somewhere along the lines there I went into therapy, lied my way through that with a couple hiccups along the way, then didn't really have more than a panic attack every fistful of months, but in the last year and a half I've had a bunch."
7717,"I'm now even afraid to see my therapist tomorrow, because she probably saw it and will think that I'm stupid and ugly and pretty much a hopeless case."
7718,"I have spoken to my doctor and she said I need to go to a therapist, however I am not ready for that yet."
7719,"Agreed with her mom, we'll try to convince her to get help for all the reasons she feels awful, come september but **how can I cope with these feelings** until then (and I know therapy doesn't magically solve everything...)

What's really frightening me is that she tells me that I'm the only thing keeping her going and her mom and dad (divorced) both tell me the same..."
7720,"I shan't relay the details of my time in therapy as it will most likely not be relevant to a great many of you (didn't go straight for meds, opted for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy instead)."
7721,"However, I can relay to you the one lesson I got out of countless sessions with my therapist: simplify your thinking."
7722,"During therapy, whenever I talked to my therapist about what was bugging me, I'd frequently go into far too much detail about what had made me anxious or angry, which would then make me feel that emotion in the present."
7723,"My therapist then challenged me: ""tell me what's wrong, but you only have a minute to do it""."
7724,"To get it out of the way, therapy is not an option for her."
7725,I talked to a counselor and went to a few sessions of hypnotherapy but I felt like it just went away.
7726,"I just started therapy, I'm in a three-month program and I'm trying to start taking scary steps like this while I have a therapist to help me work through them."
7727,I tried counseling a few times but I've had bad luck and my therapists were less than understanding.
7728,I want to go to therapy.
7729,But I can't go to therapy if I'm too scared to even open up my front door and walk to my car and drive there.
7730,I've talked to my parents and my therapist about going on homebound from school.
7731,I only told my therapist and he told me to never tell her and not do it again.
7732,"So, reddit, how can I convince my parents to let me see a therapist...soon?"
7733,I want to start going to therapy.
7734,I've recently gone to a psychotherapist and was prescribed anxiety meds.
7735,"I'm also going back to school in a few weeks, and I want to start some treatment (medication, therapy, or something) before I go back."
7736,One of my roommates keeps asking me about what I want to talk to my therapist about and she doesn't seem to want to take no for an answer and I JUST DON'T WANT TO TALK WITH HER ABOUT THEM.
7737,But I am nervous about what to expect from therapy.
7738,I struggle with panic disorder and agoraphobia for 7 years.I tried everything.Meds and phychotherapy.Nothing helped me even a little bit.I know that is not a real illness and nothing can hurt me but i just cant feel a panic attack.I am still too scared to experience it.I just fear to experience fear thats all.I am too damn scared to face it.
7739,"I haven't been seeing my therapist very long, just a few weeks, three sessions including the one I've just had."
7740,"What I mean is, did you go get a physical check-up to rule out your symptoms were anything else or did you head straight to a therapist for their opinion?"
7741,A few of my friends have suggested therapy and medication but I'm not sure what's the first step.
7742,I think I'm going to try to see a PCP first (and soon) and also look into getting some therapy.
7743,"I went to therapy three times during short periods of time because I've been diagnosed with Seasonal Depression, but left it every time after the second session because I didn't feel it helped, it only made it worse."
7744,"I've seen a therapist and she just gave me some pamphlets to read, which didn't tell me anything I hadn't already tried or didn't already know."
7745,"My Info:
18 M on Zoloft 100mg and Klonopin 1mg
Also seeing therapist and psychiatrist."
7746,"i called a clinic and am going to try to start CBT therapy next week, but i'm afraid i won't make it til then."
7747,"I'm in therapy with a great therapist and I take Effexor, but nothing's really been successful at conditioning me to manage this kind of visceral reaction."
7748,"I don't know whether the doctor I'm going to see Wednesday is a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist so I don't know if he is going to be able to prescribe medication for my anxiety and I am in desperate need of SOMETHING fast because I feel like I'm losing it every day a little more."
7749,"My therapist is on some trip, I don't get to talk to her until mid August."
7750,After writing this I called my insurance company for suggested therapists/psychiatrists.
7751,"I've been to therapy before, some years ago with little success."
7752,"I will be starting therapy soon for social anxiety, and I will talk to my therapist about this, but (thanks to the weather) it will be a few weeks before I see him."
7753,"I found a noticeably lower stress level in previously high stress/anxiety situations BUT its not a cure, and will never replace therapy."
7754,In closing let me reiterate: this is NOT meant as an endorsement for herbal remedies replacing therapists and professional help.
7755,"I've started therapy, and I think it'll help long term, but now I feel hopeless."
7756,"Basically the government was responsible for putting me in a situation where I was almost killed and raped and I am very traumatized, and my government paid therapist quit seeing me because she is a shitty therapist and I have nowhere to turn to so I'm almost literally rotting away, at least my teeth are."
7757,I can't go back to school because someone I met in group therapy for aspergers tried to get me in the bathroom so he could rape me.
7758,My occupational therapist ditche dme because I was trying to go to the dentist so my sinus infection and rotting teeth would be fixed before I went to school.
7759,I can't really afford to pay for a new therapist on my own.
7760,"I'd be able to work with my dad if that wasn't the case, but it is and it's all due to really shitty therapists and health care system!"
7761,This is just one of many times we have tried to contact hospitals and institutions to get me some long lasting therapy or adjustment of medication.
7762,I'm seeing a school therapist about my anxiety.
7763,"I even mentioned to my therapist that I figured I could experience the same cycle of anxiety because of going into surgery, and he said, ""Well, you've proven to yourself you can get through this."""
7764,"I am seeing a therapist and I'm on medication, and while those have helped few things give the instant relief that talking to my parents or close friends give."
7765,"I've tried 20 sessions of CBT/imaginative desensitization therapy with a very good psychologist... who then told me that I should seek other help, because revisiting the fear biweekly and having the trip get closer and closer was actually making me more anxious."
7766,My main issue is unwanted thoughts but since it has all never been severe I haven't seen a therapist and instead calm myself with breathing techniques.
7767,I don't really want to go to a doctor about my anxiety because im sure all that will happen is my doctor recommending a therapist and prescribing me with some strong drug like xanax.
7768,I'm currently seeing a therapist.
7769,"I've first been speaking with this clinicial/therapist woman, talking about my anxiety, depression, and other things that she thinks I have that is either a form of a personality disorder, ADHD, and some other disorder with manic episodes involved with it."
7770,"It can be a bit confusing because I'm already confusing myself, but uh, I never intended to start therapy straight with medication."
7771,"And she had not spoken to my clinic/therapist lady before-hand, because I asked her, and she said no."
7772,She wouldn't have asked me to describe my anxiety and depression to her if she had already been keeping up with my therapist.
7773,"Also, when I was waiting for a man to first prepare the urine drug test container, my therapist appeared (and she just so happened to be with this other woman who I had to do paper work with on the first day that I started going to that clinic), and my therapist lady asked how I was doing, and I told her I was good and that I was getting drug tested, but I didn't know why."
7774,Am I doing a disservice by continuing to recommend she take xanax episodically coupled with therapy sessions to talk her issues out over listening to a psychiatrist who has had her on three medications in three visits?
7775,I have never been able to afford therapy since I haven't been able to hold down a job.
7776,I did some calling around and found a therapist that understands agoraphobia and is coming to my house in 40 minutes.
7777,I should be counting my blessing that I found a therapist that will do house calls and that I can afford it yet I am just freaking out.
7778,Will I finally be able to get therapy?
7779,Did any specific medication or therapy help?
7780,I'm going to get in to see a therapist ASAP.
7781,"I started therapy last June for my debilitating depression and have made major strides in the past 9 months, but I'm noticing that in the past month or so, my anxiety levels have increased."
7782,"I've spoken with both my therapist and my doctor about this and have a generic Klonopin for days when it is overwhelming (I do not take daily medication for my disorders, and I'm trying to avoid such), and a lot of the thought process was that it was surrounding my inability to be active after an injury, but now that I'm active again, the anxiety is continuing."
7783,I'm supposed to call a therapist today.
7784,He got a number from his therapist for me because he thinks I need help.
7785,"Logically, I can see that these are reasons to go and see a therapist."
7786,my counselor has suggested group therapy with a slew of girls around my age group (aka adolescents).
7787,has anyone has any luck with group therapy?
7788,The past month or so I've been really frustrated with trying to find a good therapist.
7789,I made an appointment with my sister's old therapist since she apparently had good things to say about her.
7790,I've been putting of going to a doctor/therapist for a while now but I feel like it's time for me to just do it.
7791,I don't have a doctor near me (I'm 8 hours from home) so I'm not sure how to find someone to go to whether it's a doctor or some sort of therapist.
7792,I am going back to therapy and working on my general health.
7793,"The thought of taking antidepressants unnecessarily scares the shit out of me, and therapy sounds expensive."
7794,"I have been seeing a therapist, which has helped some, but i cannot seem to completely shake this."
7795,"I'd love to see a therapist to help me be more social and be able to interact better with other people, and ultimately just get over it, however every time I try to talk to my parents about it, I freeze up."
7796,"I guess I'm worried that they'll judge me for it, but that's illogical considering they put my older brother through therapy for almost the same reasons."
7797,I don't know if I need medication or a therapist.
7798,What should i expect from my first therapy session and how long do they usually last?
7799,I'm seeing a therapist every 2 weeks and don't even know if that is helping.
7800,"In Jordan, I met with a therapist, who agreed with me that I had GAD."
7801,"The therapist stressed on the importance of taking the right ammount of pills at the right time for six months without any interruptions, and that I should come back and visit him as soon as I am in Jordan."
7802,"I went back to Jordan, and I called up my therapist to have checkup he reuqested only to find out that he had committed suicide one day earlier."
7803,"I've never told anyone this, not even therapists, because i've always been worried that i'd be ""Judged"" accordingly."
7804,"So, of course, when I asked for therapy (I would pay for it), they said no."
7805,"Translation: ""I don't want to go through another hassle of having to be involved in your petty problems, so when you're 18 feel free to pay for your own therapy."""
7806,"Convincing my parents to take me to therapy is completely out of the picture, considering I brought it up again tonight and my dad slammed his door in my face."
7807,I've been medicated and seeing a therapist for my GAD for the last six months and have also pretty much stopped drinking during this time as I felt it made my anxiety 1000 times worse afterwards.
7808,"I'm switching insurance providers in a few months, (I only see him every 6 weeks, so we have 2 sessions left) and my therapist said I should think about what I want to say in my final session."
7809,"What also bothers alot is that I won't take any action i.e therapy, self help, meds because if all those things don't work, I am truly lost."
7810,"I got therapy, and SSRIs, moved out of the city where it happened."
7811,"Again, got therapy and SSRIs and got functional."
7812,I have my appointment with a therapist and social worker tomorrow morning.
7813,"So I been to a therapist a few times since it happened and she helps a bit, but I kind of just feel like she is telling me things that I already know."
7814,"Hey

I am undergoing brain feedback therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy of which the motive is to change certain behaviors via ""re-wiring"" certain thought patterns."
7815,"Unfortunately,  the medication that is necessar for brain feedback therapy causes synesthesia, or an ability to feel sounds through neurological impulses."
7816,"- http://steamcommunity.com/groups/therapythroughgames

If you'd like to tell me your story and whatnot, feel free to add me here - http://steamcommunity.com/id/equinoxninja"
7817,I suffer from social anxiety and depression and have been seeing my therapist once a month for about 8 months.
7818,"Last time I went to my therapist (6 weeks ago), I had told him that I had been really depressed because of my old job."
7819,"I was scheduled to have another therapy session last Friday, but didn't go because I was so depressed."
7820,"However, my therapist never called."
7821,"I just moved 30 minutes away from him, and have contemplated getting a new therapist, but I'm paranoid of telling someone I don't know my problems and them maybe not putting me on the same medication."
7822,I've been struggling with anxiety since I was about 11-13 (Somewhere in that range) and I've seen/been seeing therapists for quite some time.
7823,I told my therapist today I wanna put the kibosh on this once and for all and I even told her I'm willing to try nutritional solutions (Since my two rounds of meds didn't end wend for me) to finally get myself on track.
7824,"She's talked to a therapist through the state before, but they can only do CBT, not long term therapy."
7825,I was in therapy for about 8 years and finally got my anxiety under control so I stopped therapy.
7826,"He accepts that he has anxiety issues, but he refuses to get help and accuses me of ""badgering"" him whenever I bring up medication and/or therapy."
7827,He say he doesn't need therapy and that we can't afford it (when we can!)
7828,"One of the therapist there was available, and I ended up talking with her for several hours."
7829,I've been seeing a therapist for the past 3 years and she has been doing a great job of helping me through.
7830,But I followed my therapists advice and just focused on myself and my husband.
7831,"He won't see a therapist, this is the closest I can get to help."
7832,"Here's a disordered list of things that are bothering me, just to get it out of my head:

- It's goddamn hot and I have no A/C

- I need to order my textbooks (can be solved by, you know, ordering my textbooks)

- Even though I have a friend who says he relates, I really don't think he does, thus I have no one to share with

- I got next to no sleep last night

- I wanted to run today but it's not supposed to cool down until well after sundown so I may not have time

- I just feel really alone in having breakdowns over no real discernible cause

- My birth control prescription runs out tomorrow, I'm supposed to be on the ring free week, but now I can't pick up a new ring and need to schedule a well woman's visit before I can get a new prescription (can be solved by trying to set up an appointment and seeing what can be done)

- I clearly need to email my therapist now but I have almost no time in common with when the office is open and I don't want to have to go to a different therapist (can be solved by sending out an email and seeing what can be done)

There's no particular point to this, I just needed to get my thoughts out."
7833,"The last time I went to my doctor he kind of got the feeling that I just wanted a fix it all pill, so he told me to go to my schools therapist."
7834,"In the past I skipped blood tests because of my needle phobia, but in the last few months I have been doing cognitive behavior therapy and working around that phobia."
7835,"Just felt like sharing a new development in my struggle with anxiety:

After months of therapy, starting a couple of new medications, and working very hard on keeping life in the proper perspective, I feel *normal* for the first time in years."
7836,"So now it's a week later, I went to a therapist today with my mom."
7837,Visited a therapist today just for preliminary screening.
7838,"In the past two years, I've given up caffeine entirely, been on and off SSRIs and Benzos, taken supplements, tried holistic medicines, attempted to break up my day with physical activity, changed my diet, and cycled through numerous therapists and psychiatrists."
7839,"I have people telling me I should do this or that - find a new doctor, get some other tests, try massage therapy, try a myriad of other medications, start up a workout routine - and maybe they're right, maybe one of those are the solution."
7840,"I've been seeing a school counselor and a therapist for over a month now, and I feel like my anxiety isn't getting any more manageable."
7841,That's roughly what I told both of my therapists.
7842,"(Easier said than done) The other therapist said I blame normal feelings on an anxiety problem and if I just took better care of myself, I would be happy."
7843,Should I look into another therapist?
7844,I'm meeting my therapist for the first time on Wednesday.
7845,"I've never been to a therapist before, and I'm nervous."
7846,"**

CBT is supported by research findings, and those findings provide evidence that it is [effective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy#Evaluation_of_effectiveness) for many things (anxiety disorders, depression, eating disorders, chronic low back pain, personality disorders, substance abuse, and more)."
7847,* Behavior Experiments: [How and why to experiment](http://cbtfortherapists.blogspot.com/2012/02/cbt-and-behavioural-experiments.html).
7848,"In the last year or so, I ended up being able to talk to both a speech therapist and an expert in anxiety."
7849,"(unfortunately, I can't afford the good therapist anymore, and she was the best one I've ever had.)"
7850,I've been talking with a therapist for months.)
7851,"As I've said in another post, I'm going for therapy for the first time on Saturday, and it's really close to my mum's house."
7852,"I have been in and out of therapy for about 7 years now with anxiety problems, but this only crept up about 5 years ago."
7853,"He works with a behavioral specialist a few times a week and sees a counselor, and we'll have a speech therapist starting in January."
7854,"I went to a therapist for a year, but I don't feel like I got anything out of it."
7855,"I don't know if my therapist was very good, because I constantly felt like I had to think of things to talk about."
7856,tl;dr: Tried medication/therapy/supplements/exercise/meditation to help with my constant fear.
7857,My goal is to get some therapy aided with necessary medication.
7858,"as I'm sure you know, **discontinuing medication (and therapy) utterly and abruptly without lowering doses over time, and without any doctor supervision is extremely dangerous** but I've been left with no choice 

Why do I have to stop taking meds and going to the doctor?"
7859,"I do go to therapy every other week, we are working on me getting back to get medication."
7860,"I've been seeing a psychotherapist for 3 years now, and while the therapy was extremely helpful in cutting through my perspective in the beginning, I'm really only going back to continue my medication cycle."
7861,"If anyone has any advice on how to find fair treatment, perhaps without a therapist involved, I'd really, really appreciate it."
7862,( I can't go to therapy currently)
7863,Chances are he'll need therapy as soon as possible.
7864,"cashier, therapist, janitor."
7865,"I'm considering seeing a therapist, but I thought I'd get some opinions from you guys first."
7866,"I saw a therapist about six years ago for a couple sessions, but other than that I haven't ever dealt with mental health professionals."
7867,"I'm not so worried about therapy, but more what comes after, because I highly doubt counseling alone is going to resolve my issues."
7868,"By the way,I have been to therapy for years and it's helped me,but this is something I keep struggling with and it just feels like it's coming from a very primal internal place."
7869,I've been seeing a therapist and she wants to try [EMDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing) as I'm having serious issues with my research and class work (I'm a grad student).
7870,My mom was always very helpful and had me see professionals and take medication along with sending me to art therapy and such.
7871,My therapist had to bump my appointment until later this week so I am hoping something or someone here can help me calm this down.
7872,"When I described my feeling to my therapist in an email, she said I was flooding and to try to breathe until I could see her (gee thanks!)."
7873,"I know it's probably more of a question for a therapist but, well, the therapist isn't available right now and you guys are."
7874,"For anyone wondering, I am in therapy 1-2 a week (god bless that insurance plan) and have been on a cocktail of Prozac and Wellbutrin XL for a few years."
7875,"the pain was just normal )  

Ok think of this .. stick a cork in the bottom end .. and do not let out much of anything as the muscles down there are all fucking fried and locked down...  the the system backs up and you get acid reflux ... and you start to get bad bowl consistency ... the everything just snowsballs into a horrible shitty mess ....  

Now think of all of that as a feedback loop the worse it gets the worse it gets .... much anxiety  

Finally i demanded to see a different specialist and wham bam  totally different diagnosis ... underwent a procedure where they put me to sleep then they paralyze all the muscles down there with drugs .... then a few weeks later i started physical therapy.."
7876,So PT is me practicing tightening muscles with electrodes taped to my skinny ass... then the therapist comes in reaches in my anuns and streaches the mucles.
7877,Right now I'm in therapy mainly for anxiety but it's not changing much
7878,"i am already attending a therapy, which helps, but it doesnt help enough."
7879,"I've been to therapy before, not currently in any kind of therapy."
7880,And I saw a therapist for the first time and was able to discuss a lot of life issues I've had.
7881,I went to therapy once a few years ago at my university.
7882,"And what if this therapist is no good, too?"
7883,"I did CBT and an intensive, 3 day a week outpatient group therapy."
7884,"Hey guys, so I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety about two years ago and I have managed to keep it under control for the most part with therapy and exercise."
7885,I'm at the point where I've left therapy and I've been doing good for the past couple months.
7886,I am going to start seeing a therapist next month for general anxiety that has slowly had a negative effect on every aspect of my life over the past two years or so.
7887,"My therapist has me taking all kinds of vitamins (B-complex, D, and fish oil) and I think they are helping."
7888,"Other than 2 or 3 therapist visits, I was basically on my own."
7889,"Ok, so I started a new job about 3 weeks ago as a contracted, part-time therapist."
7890,"Two days after we broke up, I scheduled an appointment with a therapist, both to deal with the relationship issues and some other issues that I've been ignoring for far too long."
7891,"Incidentally, my first meeting with the therapist is tonight."
7892,"As I've said, I have an appointment tonight with a therapist."
7893,"I started medication and therapy, found a new job, lost a significant amount of weight, and started exercising regularly and have pretty much rid myself of the crippling anxiety attacks and days spent in bed dreading having to deal with the world."
7894,"She has been refusing to seek therapy or medication since it didn't do much for her in the past, but I don't really know how she can if she's so dead-set on not seeking help."
7895,"After a not-terribly-heated argument with her, she made some calls and set up a consultation with a therapist."
7896,"I was in therapy at age 11, given a depression diagnosis and put on anti-depressants at age 12 or 13, and given a Nonverbal Learning Disorder (a very high-functioning autistic spectrum disorder, basically a less severe Asperger's) diagnosis shortly after."
7897,Will they make me see a therapist?
7898,"I was done with 4 out of 5 years of my dual degree (music ed, music therapy), engaged, happy, confident, etc."
7899,"I've tried therapy, I'm not confident that any doctor would consider me for medication, but it physically hurts."
7900,"I would love to see a therapist or someone professional, but to be frank it just isn't an option for me right now."
7901,"#[Anxiety Results June 2015](http://therapyresources.org/anxietysubsurveyresults/anxietyresults2015.png)

7907,What can a therapist do?
7908,I've been to see a therapist only once and she said I may suffer from a type of anxiety disorder.
7909,It can be a great tool for psychotherapy.
7910,"I'll add more to this as I think of things :)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I am effectively beating this motherfucking disorder one day and one step at a time using congnitive behavioural therapy."
7911,"I had already ""outsmarted therapy"" because I already knew more about my disorder than any other person could."
7912,"Another interesting thing is that I actually study psychology, so am well aware of cognitive behavioural therapy being the #1 MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT for anxiety and panic disorder."
7913,Over the past several years I have attended therapy off and on for my anxiety and depression.
7914,After emdr therapy it has gotten more tolerable or at least the anxiety has.
7915,I have had the all clear to quit attending from my therapist because I was doing really well in my day to day life.
7916,By the time I actually get to my physiotherapy appointment it'll have been inured for 2.5 months.
7917,I need to be reassured by the physiotherapist that this is not permanent.
7918,TLDR; don't know if my anxiety is enough to need therapy/medicine.
7919,"(http://www.choosemuse.com/)

I got it because I have done some biofeedback in therapy in the past and found it interesting and somewhat helpful."
7920,My anxiety got the best of me and I went through the torture of trial and error with medication and therapy.

7927,Had therapy for awhile and meds until I chose to go off of them in high school.

7939,"Plus, maybe ""covered california"" can get me into therapy?"
7940,Every day I'm sick with anxiety just for a paycheck and no therapist or medication has been able to help me to stop feeling that way.
7941,For the next four years I was on and off of various anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications and I also did weekly therapy.
7942,"I stopped medications and therapy for a short while and started again when I was 18, because my parents divorced and I was heading to college."

7949,"I've never dealt with any serious anxiety before aside from about 7 months of being unable to be separate from my mother during grade 7 (she even came to school with me, when I look back at it I feel extremely embarassed), I probably had a panic attack every 2 weeks on average, which I went to a therapist for a while about."
7950,"If you are having panic attacks consistently, seek a therapist."
7951,"Most importantly, options like exposure therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy can be your ticket to recovery."
7952,"I did go see a therapist for my ""Anger Issues"" when it was thought to be just that, but I wasn't really that ""open"" I think, and I was diagnosed with a ""mild general anxiety disorder"" which to me was code for ""I dunno here's some pills""."
7953,"I went to some relaxation therapy group where we did meditation and breathing exercises, and the breathing can help at times, but I instantly go to a 10 and have to back myself down."
7954,I got CBT there and when I came back home I went to see a therapist here.
7955,"Side notes: I am in therapy, though unmedicated."
7956,"I've been seeing a therapist since June, and spoke with a psychiatrist in July, but decided to hold off on medication."
7957,"I finally had enough and I talked to my therapist Thursday, and had an appointment with a psychiatrist Friday morning."
7958,"The therapy was somewhat helpful, but my anxiety was still uncontrolled."
7959,"I think of it this way: before I saw the therapist, I'd suddenly feel like I was at the top of a rollercoaster, and it had already started over the top of the highest drop."
7960,"I talked to my primary doctor, and they sent me to a behavioral therapist."
7961,The therapist told me they couldn't help me and I needed to see a psychiatrist.
7962,"I have not had any assessments besides a short 10 minute talk with a therapist, she basically went over a checklist and asked me how often I feel anxious."
7963,"It has become impossible to get help, the other doctors I've seen in the past would prescribe me something like zoloft but it never worked, and I was never sent to see a psychiatrist to get real therapy."
7964,I am finally thinking of seeing a therapist and try to get over this.
7965,My fiance has suggested that I could see a therapist (for my general anxiety/hypochondriac issues).
7966,My mom would think it was silly that I need to see a therapist over this issue.
7967,I would also prefer other methods besides seeing a therapist if possible.
7968,"I've been depressed for 2+ years now, I did see a therapist for about 3 months which was 5 maybe 6 visits and I may as well have talked to a wall."
7969,I'm a very logical person and like to think things through with reasoning and thought I'd get some back and forth from the therapist.
7970,"So now I have an appointment tomorrow to see a therapist, that can then refer me to a psychiatrist because that's the policy."
7971,"TL;DR Depressed for 2+ years, had a bad experience with a therapist so I didn't go back."
7972,"I cant seem to find a good therapist either I dont want a male, and I don't want an old lady."
7973,"Examples:

- I worry an awful lot that my psychologist will forget to refer me to a therapist."
7974,I saw the psychologist on Friday last week and she said she'd email or call me when she's referred me or when she's referred me and the therapist has confirmed he's gotten the referral (don't remember which one).
7975,If you truly are depressed I recommend long term therapy combined with medical help and step by step lifestyle changes.
7976,"My doctor told me its best for me not to stop on them, he doesn't want to change my presciption at all untill i see a therapist."
7977,"I suggested he talk to a therapist, but he said in the past it hasn't helped so he doesn't want to talk to a therapist or anyone else."
7978,"I tried psychotherapy, herbal supplements, exercise, etc."
7979,"I was at a friend's birthday party and after months of intense therapy, I finally was able to be in a group of people and be myself (mostly) and not feel like I needed everyone to like me."
7980,"I am exhausted beyond all reason, first time in a social setting since I started more intensive therapy about a year ago."
7981,Is therapy or just dealing with it the better option?
7982,This led to seeing a mental health team while I got stuck on a waiting list for the kind of therapy I needed.
7983,"I finally got my therapy a couple of weeks ago, at the same time I got this new job, which is 9-5."
7984,"This therapy is near my parents house: I moved a couple of weeks ago to land this job, which was quite stressful."
7985,"So I need this therapy so I can be productive in my job, but with my job being a 9-5 job and their opening hours also being 9-5, I won't be able to go."
7986,The kind of therapy I'm getting isn't available in the are I live in now.
7987,"I'm actually supposed to be going to this therapy tomorrow, but they'll be no way I can make it now I work during the day."
7988,Take a sick day tomorrow to go to therapy?
7989,Not go to therapy and explain later?
7990,"Tl;dr: have therapy 9-5, my new job which I know I'm bad at already and makes me anxious is also 9-5."
7991,I was going to the therapist for a while last year and I was doing better.
7992,I have done research and spoke with a therapist who confirmed she thinks its anxiety and panic attacks.
7993,"I do see a therapist but my old one left the practice, so I'm currently seeing a new one."
7994,"Okay, so I've been going to a therapist where I live for depression and anxiety."
7995,"I'm kind of worried because my therapist says that it's quite possible that my relationship could flip, turn upside down if I don't start taking care of myself (Loooong story...)."
7996,"Before, I've been to CBT therapy and I meditate, exercise, and do a lot to keep myself busy and whatever, doing away with things that I know cause me mental distress."
7997,Can't go to therapy anymore because insurance won't cover it and all that.
7998,"Because of that I was treated like a 5 year old at the therapist, so I didn't like going and eventually stopped, without being diagnosed with anything."
7999,"I knew I would feel anxious here, so I got to see a therapist before, to get some pills."
8000,I won't be able to see a therapist for about a month.
8001,I have other anxiety that I have started seeing a therapist for yesterday.
8002,Another thing that freaks me out is the possibility that I won't be able to find a therapist who knows about these things.
8003,"And what makes me more anxious is that I know if a therapist told me ""congratulations, you're not transgender"" I would still continue to doubt it and be unhappy."
8004,After 3 years of therapy I felt well enough to stop and try to do thingso n my own.
8005,"My therapist keeps telling me to work on breathing techniques, but it's hard to put them into practice when my my body is flat out preventing it no matter how hard I try."
8006,"I want to ask my parents to take me to a therapist so that I can begin to get help, but they'll ask me a lot of questions that I don't exactly know the answers to."
8007,I'm not looking forward to the exposure therapy my psych was describing.
8008,Extra therapy.
8009,I've been so proud of myself lately since stopping therapy and coming off my meds (Lexapro).
8010,And now I've forgotten all the tools I've learned in therapy because I never got the chance to use them.
8011,"I am medicated for anxiety, have gone to counselling and therapy, do meditation and yoga, and yes, because of that there are times when I feel like I can push myself into doing things that require confidence."
8012,"I'm feeling less anxious today but writing this kind of spurred it again :(

I have depression and have a weekly appointment with a therapist.. but I'm hoping that someone can relate/help calm me down."
8013,My therapist offered prescription antianxiolytics but I declined and said I would like to try without first.
8014,"No single treatment could have led me to where I am now, but with therapy, acupuncture, healthy spiritual and physical practices, that Mindweather course, and a lot of patience, I am panic attack free and have hardly any social anxiety."
8015,"I went to therapy and started really working to make things better for myself and, for a long time, my symptoms were incredibly well controlled (some bad days here and there, but I was in really good shape for the most part)."
8016,"I plan to start seeing a therapist soon, but I feel this need to also tell my employer about what I've been going through."
8017,"I am on an anti-psychotic, but it's not helping with the hypochondria at all and there are no therapists for me where I live."
8018,I'm currently seeing a therapist working through exposure therapy for an extreme fear of vomiting.
8019,"Im seeing my therapist tommorow and it hurts because it feels like a step back, but perhaps I can take this as an oppurtunity to grow."
8020,"I kept telling myself, once you get a new job you can afford therapy."
8021,"What it really came down to, though, was that therapy is lumped into that terrifying category of The Unknown."
8022,"So I tell him up-front what I need to do - get therapy, try and get my head on right."
8023,I've been told before by a therapist to try to picture the night and realize nothing bad will happen-- trying to do that now and reassure myself.
8024,"Before I started therapy, I had to wash my hands again if I touched something that has been touched by others (like the jar of marmelade that has been touched by the vendor) during breakfast."
8025,"I started psychotherapy one year ago, after it got so severe that I couldn't do anything normally."
8026,"Both the therapy, which I'm still following, and the medication eased it a little so I could ""live"" again."
8027,My girlfriend and my therapist are still the only ones who know about how severe it was and how severe it still is.
8028,"Nowadays it got a little better due to therapy but it's still awful*

*Also thinking about doing an AmA...what do you think?"
8029,"After 5 years of anxiety (IBS, fainting, fatigue) and little improvement with meds (SSRI and benzo) and therapy (every second week) I recently realized that antihistamine (taken for my hay fever) cured 80% of my symptoms."
8030,"I've struggled with anxiety in some form or another almost my entire life, and I've seen a therapist for about 2-3 years."
8031,"My therapist is no help, my friends do not understand, quiet frankly I feel alone, and I don't do what do to anymore."
8032,"This is especially true because I recently stopped being able to afford therapy due to financial issues, and I don't want to regularly be on antidepressants."
8033,I simply cannot afford therapy.
8034,I don't see how I could possibly pay out of pocket for therapy.
8035,"I've benefited from CBT therapy in the past, so I feel I could really use the help of a professional..."
8036,Can I volunteer to receive therapy from a student?
8037,"He said I could take a prescription right then and there if I wanted, or he could refer me to a therapist, or i could just take the list of suggestions and go home and read about them and think about it for a while, which is what i chose to do."
8038,"I know I should probably do some therapy, and I am considering it, but for now I just want something to help me out a bit to get a job and then I can start focusing on some therapy, which may even help me with guidance in life as well."
8039,I am really fucked up and don't think I'll be able to find a therapist who is proficient at treating all 3 of my disorders.
8040,"I have been seeing a therapist, but my final session past last Wednesday, and I feel I achieved absolutely nothing."
8041,"So I have severe social anxiety, I see a therapist and take medication for it."
8042,If I tell my parents I want to see a therapist they laugh in my face.
8043,"Also I'd just like to note that I have gotten treatment for my anxiety from professionals in the past, but we've since hit an financial rough spot and are currently unable to afford any therapy or medication."
8044,"I'd rather go to therapy although I'm not sure if that's covered by my health insurance or not, I'll have to see."
8045,I am going to talk to my therapist about it but I can't see her for another month.
8046,I've tried CBT and DBT and several other types of behavioral therapy.
8047,"It's gotten worse lately as I just restarted therapy and we're in the ""Gets worse before it gets better"" stage."
8048,"Also, for those too poor for a therapist, if you're in a college area new graduate therapists provide 6 months of therapy for free as interns."
8049,"I've had anxiety for a while, was seeing a therapist in college who suggested meds but couldn't actually prescribe them, so I was never on them."
8050,"I explained that I've tried calling around to therapists, and their answer is usually they're not accepting patients at this time."
8051,"My therapist has been awesome for listening, although I feel bad that I always run down the clock with my talking before we get to any discussions."
8052,"My therapist is on long service leave and I have a lot of things I have to get done, schoolwork, homework, leaving the house in general, even my birthday this weekend."
8053,"I ended up visiting with a therapist who, after I described my situation to her, concluded that I may have social anxiety."
8054,"My options are: 

-Change my major to Psychology (way easier) and drop premed requirements
-Take a leave and work, with regular therapy 
-Take a leave and work, taking 2 easy classes to keep me up to speed
-Keep my Neuroscience major, but drop premed requirements 

Or any combination of the above."
8055,"There are many treatments available for generalized anxiety disorder, and they usually work best in a combination – though every individual is different and will respond in unique ways to different therapies."
8056,"Talk therapy - Oftentimes, our subconscious works against our conscious minds in ways we don't fully understand."
8057,Appropriate psychotherapy and counseling can help us identify subconscious motivations for anxiety and fear and then work to address the causes of those problems.
8058,"Alternative therapies - There are many alternative therapies available, from herbal treatments to technologically driven options, such as neurofeedback."
8059,"Every day I had something new wrong with me, and it only started to get better recently thanks to a very helpful therapist."
8060,My therapist constantly tells me that its all my OCD but the thing he's missing is that while it may be OCD its a FACT.
8061,"I've been seeing my therapist about it, but it's still a very big issue, and is seriously affecting my job performance."
8062,"[9/9, 6:00 PM] Sophie: how is she therapist
[9/9, 6:01 PM] Joe: Let me just shove some more antidepressants with 10 pages of side-effects down your throat when scientists still don't understand how Depression, Anxiety, and Anti-depressants work completely."
8063,"I have not been officially diagnosed with either but I have had a CBT therapist pretty much ""confirm"" that I also suffer from anxiety."
8064,"I'm usually torn between the urge to move move move and the urge to stay as still as possible and hopefully not exist anymore (as described above) 

I tried going to a CBT therapist cause that's what my mom did to help her with her anxiety (which is chronic) but the point of that is to help to adjust the way you think so you're not stressing yourself out."
8065,I also have an old injury which I go around worrying about although I've done the exercises recommended by a physiotherapist.
8066,What I'm looking for here is anyone whose had severe sleeping issues which have made them better with therapy (CBT).
8067,"I've already seen several psychologists,  and there's been nothing in therapy that I've been afraid to do."
8068,I went to the doctor yesterday on the advice of my therapist.
8069,I just moved two hours away from my old doctor and therapist so I had to be seen by a family doc since the wait for a psychiatrist around here is around three months.
8070,I know I need therapy.
8071,"I have seen a therapist, and she recommend anti-depressants."
8072,I saw a therapist on two occasions for a few months each time.
8073,I'm going to my first therapist meeting tomorrow and I'm terrified.
8074,"I would love to talk to my physiotherapist about it, as sometimes he cracked my back and these pains disappeared, but he is out of the state and I cant get any other fast, cant even make arrangements during weekend."
8075,I'm doing a lot of hard work with exposure and therapy and all that.
8076,Are there such things as walk-in therapists?
8077,"Neither my parents nor I wanted to try medication at that point, so we decided to try therapy."
8078,"I switched therapists multiple times, hoping that maybe one of them would suit me."
8079,Plus the thought of talking to a therapist and getting tests done scares me.
8080,I have a therapist and psychiatrist.
8081,My therapist is putting me on anxiety meds.
8082,"My therapist noticed my fingers and gave me a tissue, but that didn't stop anything."
8083,So today is my first time visiting a therapist.
8084,He referred me to start seeing a therapist which I did.
8085,I met with my therapist for 5 sessions.
8086,"I saw my therapist for a final session, and she strongly recommended that I speak to my PCP about starting the Lexapro."
8087,I've made a therapist appointment but I am worried about how well it can possibly go – I'm not good at explaining my thoughts.
8088,I [F21] have been to a therapist before but only for depression as a teenager.
8089,I didn't take it for very long because it made me so incredibly nauseous and I thought the therapy was helping enough anyway.
8090,I would talk myself out of doing so though because I didn't think I would have anything to talk about to a therapist.
8091,"It didn't seem like the anxiety was effecting me enough to justify continuously meeting with a therapist, it was more of an occasional thing."
8092,"Which is why I'm asking.. Would it be possible to be prescribed a medication first, before actually going to a therapist?"
8093,She stopped seeing her therapist about two weeks ago and the anxiety has gotten a lot worst since then.
8094,"So far medications have been helpful, and I finally found a good therapist."
8095,"My last two were terrible, and the most recent one was trying to practice covert ex-gay christian therapy on me."
8096,"I have some sort of personal blockade against going to therapy, I don't know why."
8097,"I'm in therapy right now, and it helps, but I don't think it'll be the ultimate fix."
8098,"I've been in and out of therapy since I was 13, and ultimately every therapist has decided that I have good enough coping skills, making therapy really isn't the right place for me."
8099,I'm doing EMDR and talk therapy and both of my therapists agree that there's no way they're going to get rid of my fears.
8100,My boyfriend finally convinced me to see a therapist.
8101,I would like to maybe go back and see a therapist but my healthcare doesn't cover it right now.
8102,male and I recently decided to actually commit to therapy.
8103,"I've been several times before, but I don't think I opened up as much to my prior therapists and as a result, not many stones were turned over."
8104,"This time around, I've found an amazing therapist who's a lot like me, and it's been going well for the most part."
8105,"I know it's going to differ from person to person, but my question is this: 

Is it common to feel like your life is getting worse when you start therapy?"
8106,"I feel like it's a result of pushing against the grain, but I just want to make sure my therapist isn't getting a wrong read of me and enabling tendencies that get in the way of what I really want to do with my life."
8107,"Oh, and I'll see the therapist (doctor handles assessment, drugs and finding therapist here but not the actual therapy) this weekend... let's see how it goes."
8108,"I know therapy is the answer, but as I said, I usually don't feel it to the point that it affects my life the way it is now."
8109,I started seeing a therapist and was on antidepressants.
8110,The therapy didn't really help.
8111,"I can manage my normal anxiety levels just fine after years and years of therapy, but dealing with this makes no sense to me."
8112,"I'm on meds and see a therapist, but I don't see her all that often because aside from the occasional panic attack, and now my sleep issues, things aren't too bad."
8113,I've been going to therapy and it's helping a lot.
8114,"I'm off to talk with my therapist about all of this in an hour, but I just sort of had to get it off my chest."
8115,I'm looking forward to opening up with my therapist about it.
8116,Recently I've been thinking about finally going to a therapist and getting help with my anxiety.
8117,"Yesterday I did a search for therapists near me and my anxiety got horrible, and then I started crying."
8118,I started seeing a therapist to try to help with my anxiety.
8119,"I decided that I was going to come back off of the Zoloft and try just doing therapy for the time being, so I stopped taking it Monday."
8120,"When I went to a therapist after my first breakup, he seemed confused that I'd be having anxiety about something like that."
8121,Luckily that day she had an appointment with her therapist and she spoke to her mother.
8122,"In that 4 years I mentioned in the parenthesis I got therapy (assumed for depression but now it seems to be anxiety), went to community college and got a BA degree in arts and humanities."
8123,"So, r/anxiety, I guess my question is is it worth it to keep doing my therapy?"
8124,"I know I didn't make it clear in my little history section but my therapy helped me a lot through some tough times, but now I'm stuck living at my parent's house with an almost fake job and even though therapy was great while i was in it i feel it's taught me everything it can."
8125,I've done it before and while I feel like I learned a lot I don't know if my therapist has what I need right now.
8126,I have not held on to any more friendships and haven't had a phone call from anyone but teachers and therapists in months.
8127,I started a therapy group for generalized anxiety this semester but I'm having a lot of trouble relating to many of the people in my group because they have more social anxiety.
8128,"He first suggested to go see a therapist, but that would cost a hell of a lot of money (which I cannot afford right now), or medication."
8129,"My dad thinks it's just because I'm shy, even though my therapist has explained that going through things like my step-father have long-lasting effects."
8130,"I'm a little low on cash and time right now and I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for good CBT books or workbooks that deal with GAD, depression, and or trauma therapy."
8131,I don't have the time and money to see a therapist and would love to have a workbook or something to do a little self help for myself.
8132,"After 2 years of depression 2012 - 2014 I went to the psychiatrist and psychologist, I started therapy, I was diagnosed with GAD and mild depression and stat taking antidepressants; even though I feel in a way I had never felt before I couldn't make new memories so easy."
8133,"I could go to psychiatry therapy again although I didn't liked the way I felt in antidepressants, anyone of you is in mood stabilizers."
8134,"I finally got the strength to send her a long and heartfelt message, thanks to my great therapist and decent medication to give me some clarity."
8135,If we aren't talking about my attacks- I feel more relaxed but I know what I really need to do with the therapist is to work on the attacks.
8136,I guess that's why I'm still perusing therapy.
8137,I start with a new therapist soon and I am not looking forward to freaking out as an introduction.
8138,"When my parents discovered one of my suicide notes, they asked me if I wanted to go into therapy, and I did."
8139,For three years I went to therapy and it did some good but some harm.
8140,"After some time in therapy, my therapist suggested I take medication to help with both of these symptoms."
8141,I took myself out of therapy and decided to battle this on my own.
8142,"It took me a year, but I was able to get a hold on it with xanax and infrequent therapy sessions."
8143,"Whether my group therapy is finally helping or I'm just having a really good streak, I've been feeling a lot better."
8144,I am currently doing therapy and my psychologist gave me a sheet related to CBT to help me change how I think of myself and apply it in real life situations but I'm wondering if there is also anything online that could help as well.
8145,"She's not in therapy or on any medication, though she has been in therapy in the past."
8146,"I've got an initial therapy appt in March, but I do have to make it through till then."
8147,"However I have been working out everyday, seeing my therapist, and adjusted my medication."
8148,"NOTE: I have been doing therapy (had to stop due to insurance - trying my best to continue CBT on my own and with books), have taken celexa in the past (but it stopped working for me), and have currently found out I am hypothyroid and working on getting the right dosage of medicines for that."
8149,So today was my first therapy session.
8150,What I finally found out was that a LOT of psychiatrists and therapists don't know what they're doing.
8151,I have a phone interview in a few weeks with a therapist but I'm no longer looking forward to any forms of treatment because of how yesterday went.
8152,Don't want to come across spiteful but will this therapist actually want to hear my notes and my thought process'?
8153,"But I've never been carsick.. 

Anyways, it's the drive to my therapy appointment."
8154,My therapist said she was puzzled as to why it wasn't getting any easier.
8155,I havent been able to see a psychologist/therapist for about a year because we have been low on money and i want to soon if possible.
8156,"My mother also has *severe* anxiety, but unlike her I've been willing to go to therapy and have gone through CBT."
8157,I can't meet with my therapist until next Wednesday.
8158,"I plan to begin psychotherapy, so please don't think I'm just wanting an ""easy fix"", I am well aware pharmaceuticals only go so far in treating mental health."
8159,Been doing therapy and I have definitely improved in terms of the anxiety.
8160,"I see my therapist again on Tuesday and he's expecting me to have applied for a few jobs, and yet I have applied for none."
8161,CBT and exposure therapy worked for me first time round however this time round it hasnt worked and ive exhausted NHS options.
8162,Im looking for a private therapist however im unsure what sort of qualifications in that therapist I should be looking for?
8163,Would a Phycotherapist be best?
8164,Looking on a UK directory http://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/ they all seems to be experts in all aspects of therapy as opposed to what I need so im looking for help/suggestions on what to narrow my search down too
8165,"We went to couple's therapy which was very giving, but we'd go back to ""normal"" soon after."
8166,"We did couples therapy again, and things were not good."
8167,"We went to do one last couple's session with the same therapist, and there was kind of a revelation."
8168,"""Ohhhh it's the anxiety"", said the therapist."
8169,I'm working with my therapist to be better with my anxiety but it wont be enough.
8170,I wonder if going off my meds for a month (with my therapist's permission) to show him the real uncontrolled me would convince him that I need the medication... ideas?
8171,I'd like to give a go for psychological therapies only first so I was just thinking is there a point seeing my GP in that case?
8172,"I started seeing multiple psychologists and each of them would drill into me that i need to apply ACT (acceptance commitment therapy) which was new, yet very consistent way to get rid of anxiety."
8173,It's getting really uncomfortable to live now i mean forget medication and therapy i don't even have someone to talk to someone to pour my heart out too.
8174,So my therapist mentioned that I should search for anxiety hypnosis on youtube and watch some videos.
8175,I haven't got a clue where to look for therapy though.
8176,"I feel like I should talk to a therapist or counselor, but I also feel like I would be wasting their time since I'm not a Schizophrenic begging on the streets or anything like that."
8177,"To her therapy seems to be just a ""place to talk""."
8178,"I'm willing to persist with the talk therapy if it's worth it, i can find the money if i have to, but is it actually any use, or just a huge waste of a lot of $2 minutes?"
8179,"I've tried meditation,  exercise,  picking up (girls),  cognitive therapy."
8180,I was just wondering the main pros and cons of graduated exposure therapy and flooding.
8181,I went to see a therapist a couple times after some turmoil between my wife and mother caused significant anxiety.
8182,"My therapist recommended that I go to see a psychiatrist, I put it off and wound up injuring my back and was out of commission for a couple weeks."
8183,"Time passed and I totally forgot about the appointment, my therapist and my anxiety."
8184,I have been to therapy and things have been getting a lot better over the past few days for me with my anxiety.
8185,I know from my therapist that not thinking about it and relaxing will help this.
8186,I have been on medication and been in lots of therapy over the past 6 years and don't believe there is a silver bullet to getting rid of anxiety.
8187,"I've been in therapy with social workers for three years, since I moved out on my own and got my own health insurance."
8188,"In my therapy sessions I feel that I made significant progress:

(1) I managed to overcome my irrational fears of becoming pregnant and ""ruining my life"" like all the other girls I went to high school with (thanks mom)."
8189,"She told me that I could seek therapy, diet, and exercise ""until the cows come home"" but because I'm biologically broken, I will never be happy without medication."
8190,"I've been working with a therapist but I can't find out why these pains keep happening, because they seem to be triggered by nothing."
8191,"I've got about a week before I can see my therapist and I could use some help, so here goes."
8192,"I've spent time talking with my therapist about keeping a small supply of depression medication with me, as I've traveled to unfamiliar places before and I tend to suffer from sensory overload, but I haven't been on drugs since high school and I'm not sure what would help."
8193,"I know about CBT from the therapist’s perspective, but I can I except as a patient?"
8194,"She’s starting therapy this week and is planning on reporting her parents, which is making her anxious."
8195,I'm sitting in a parking lot waiting for my appointment with a new therapist and I am freaking out.
8196,I've tried one therapist before about 4 years ago and it seemed like it wasn't for me.
8197,"I've been seeing a therapist the past two months, but I don't really feel like it's helping."
8198,I expressed an interest in going to a therapist when my SO mentioned how much it had helped recently.
8199,"I am trapped in this downward spiral, and there is only so much my therapist and doctors can do."
8200,"Since then it's been a wild ride of medications, therapy, and friend support."
8201,I'm current off medication and not going to therapy ever since I moved to Canada from the US.
8202,I get health insurance next year but I'm not sure if they cover therapy.
8203,"I cant afford therapy, I'm already on meds so that isnt the issue."
8204,I have been seeing a new therapist for about 5 months now on a weekly basis.
8205,I have seen other therapists on and off my entire life (22yoFemale) and I just feel like I never have any luck.
8206,"It's only 11:15pm and I'm already really anxious about next year (I think I mostly worry about all the stress, studies, the crippling perfectionism, all the problems caused by my Asperger's and my somewhat unstable therapy situation)."
8207,"Recently, after talking with a therapist about my thought patterns (which she characterized as ""anxious"", to my surprise) and experiencing panic attacks in stressful situations fairly regularly, I finally realized that my biggest problem stems not from being depressed, but from the onslaught of anxious thoughts and feelings that, eventually, wear me out so much that I become depressed."
8208,"Before speaking with a therapist I hadn't even realized that I was living on a daily basis with intense negative self-talk, a pessimistic worldview and the characteristic low self-esteem."
8209,"Occasionally I'd bounce one of my more negative ideas off someone, only to be told it ""wasn't true"", but nothing really made it clear to me until my therapist hit the nail on the head."
8210,"I am no psychologist, neurologist, or therapist."
8211,My anxiety has gotten better and I have improved since therapy but holy cow I am completely regretting accepting this job.
8212,I saw a therapist last year and was in the hospital twice for PPD and anxiety issues.
8213,Attended therapy from April 2013-January 2014.
8214,I have been in therapy for over a year and am on medication.
8215,I'm not taking medication and every medical professional and therapist I've seen have told me this is simply acute anxiety/stress responses that I need to deal with.
8216,I've got some other ideas like vitamins and water therapy too.
8217,"Uncontrollable panic attacks resulting from a visit to the college I will be attending in the fall landed me in therapy, and today my lifelong issues have been diagnosed: it's an anxiety disorder."
8218,Eventually I got put into a CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) course which was great and  I slowly got my life back.
8219,"Overall, I slowly got better after my first attack with the help of meds and some therapy, but it seems like I am experiencing bouts of depersonalization again here and there, and most of the time, it doesn't accompany an anxiety attack."
8220,I'm also shopping around for a therapist that I click with.
8221,"I've been seeing a therapist about other issues (check out my previous posts from raisedbynarcissists), and haven't had a chance to bring this up yet, and can't go back until next week."
8222,So I see this as a kind of therapy; after suffering 1 week (and still now) with what I feel is an awful migraine headache.
8223,"I've gone to see a therapist about 8 months ago, but only briefly."
8224,"And there's lots of other stuff I could rant about too, how every single mental health professional has my parents down as annoying asses, how we couldn't even do family therapy because they refused to see the points."
8225,"What should I do to help myself, and what should I do with therapy?"
8226,"I can't afford and don't have time to seek therapy right now, so I'm just looking for any insight I can get about what to do in the mean time."
8227,I've made a lot of progress in therapy and feel I don't need it anymore since I have a lot more tools to cope with it now.
8228,"Thanks to her, I have found a therapist who I'll hopefully will be visiting soon."
8229,I hope this therapist helps.
8230,"I know I should probably contact someone like a counselor or therapist to begin digging to the root of the issue, but **does anyone have any advice on controlling anxiety while driving?"
8231,I've started seeing a therapist and doing yoga a few times per week.
8232,"(i realize that you can't 100% rely on meds to cure anxiety and that therapy plays a crucial role, but for this question i just want to focus on the drug aspect in particular)"
8233,I was working with my therapist on going back to school the next year and it seemed like I was making good progress.
8234,Now here's a little history - from the time I was 8-10 I had a therapist who'd work with me once a week on exercises to control things.
8235,"Again, I talk to a new therapist, who asked us (me and my dad) a ton questions, And I showed her and she read my letter."
8236,"I still am seeing a therapist to help adjust to it, and I will start going to group sessions for anxiety in july."
8237,Has anybody here seen improvements in the way he feels and behaves after psychotherapy sessions and could share the experience?
8238,Been doing daily 30 minutes of exercise and plan on seeing a therapist once I'm back on health insurance.
8239,"Hello, I'm a 16 year old male who has been seeing a therapist for about 2 weeks."
8240,He is going to be giving me therapy (I assume cognitive) however we've also decided that I will look into SSRIs because they greatly helped my mother and I believe they can help me.
8241,"Since he is only a therapist he doesn't have the ability to prescribe me medication, so I will likely be seeing a psychiatrist or General Practioner/Pediatrician to discuss medication."
8242,"**c)**What might the experience be like, and will I have to be re-diagnosed or do you think my therapist's notes will suffice?"
8243,I was going to therapy and was on meds for over a year and was doing fantastic.
8244,"So now, one month later been off meds and no therapy and was doing okay till the headaches started."
8245,"I talked to my mom about therapy, she basically told me I don't need it."
8246,"I've been in therapy for my current anxiety for a little over 2 years, I've tried as-needed medication a long time ago but did not continue with it."
8247,"My therapist has tried to convince me to email my professor, do the work and get to class tomorrow but I know myself better than that."
8248,"Soon after, I was urged to get therapy."
8249,They didn't want to take me to therapy or the doctor.
8250,I am now in therapy and taking a daily SSRI.
8251,She looked at me wide-eyed and told me that I have an anxiety disorder and should seek therapy.
8252,Calling the therapist was one of the hardest things I've ever done.
8253,I need to talk to my doctor on Monday but I'm seriously considering getting off the medication and trying to deal with anxiety through therapy or other non-drug methods.
8254,"I'm a senior in high school and I was diagnosed with social anxiety and, what my therapist calls, social phobia last January after I broke down to my mom."
8255,Since then I've been seeing a therapist roughly twice a month.
8256,"My therapist has given me a bunch of exercises to help reduce my anxiety, but most of the time I feel like they hardly work."
8257,"I've talked to my therapist about it, and she says that she can only do so much with me when I'm not even leaving the house to go to school."
8258,"I started reading self help books, I saw a therapist, I did talk therapy, CBT, even virtual reality, nothing ever worked."
8259,"Early in 2014, Reid (a close friend of mine from back in London who also moved to New York) decided to take this exposure therapy treatment for his SA."
8260,"So, finally the day came, I didn't get much sleep the night before, but I met the Dr and we did what they call exposure therapy."
8261,"I have found, through therapy, that the OCD is something that underlies most of my panic and anxiety attacks."
8262,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, but this has been bothering me for some time, and only recently have I confronted it and seen a therapist/counselor."
8263,My parents don't believe that I need to speak with a therapist about my problems.
8264,I have been looking into Art Therapy or adult colouring books like [this](http://www.amazon.ca/Enchanted-Forest-Inky-Quest-Coloring/dp/1780674880/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427694578&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=art+therapy+coloring+book) or [this](http://www.amazon.ca/Color-Me-Happy-Coloring-Templates/dp/1937994767/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427694578&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=art+therapy+coloring+book) in the hopes of helping her feel more independent again (she pretty much needs in home care to help her clean and cook etc.)
8265,"I'm going to therapy, seeing a psychiatrist and am going to a career counselor, so I'm getting help and I'm hopeful."
8266,Then they tell me I made it to the second round of interviews and they wanted me to meet with an occupational therapist to 'see if I would fit into their workplace.'
8267,"Having never met with an occupational therapist before, I thought why not."
8268,They took me out to dinner before I had to go to the therapist.
8269,"One of the managers there recognized the number and pulled me aside later that meeting to tell me I had the job, they've turned away other people, and that they were talking about paying me X amount of dollars bc of my qualifications, and not to worry about ur meeting with the therapist bc it was just a formality."
8270,"Before I left to meet the therapist, another manager told me that out of all the candidates who applied, i stood out bc of my detailed cover letter, experience, etc... And he said he would really like it if I came to work for them and not to worry about the meeting with the therapist."
8271,"When I got to the therapist, that is where everything went down hill."
8272,So I was trying really hard to say and do the right things at this new interview and the meeting with the therapist.
8273,"Well the therapist was very rude and basically wanted me to tell him my life story, which I was not going to do."
8274,One of the lower managers was the first one to pick up his phone and said 'well it looks like your meeting with (therapist) didn't go well.
8275,"Not 10 minutes later the higher up manager calls me and gives me a spill of '(therapist) had some
Concerns about you and after some internal discussion, we've decided to go with someone else..."
8276,"!it upset me That I got a call on a Wednesday asking me to meet with the therapist on Friday, even though at that time I still lived two hours away."
8277,"If me getting the job was so contingent on this therapist's recommendation, I wish they would have told me....I feel like I wasted my time."
8278,"Most of these people, both therapist and psychiatrist, do not know what they are doing, do not realize how incompentent they are, and are effectively trying random things till something sticks, which is what happened to get the medication I am on."
8279,* Will I be able to convince him to talk to a therapist?
8280,And I can control that with medication and some minor therapy (usually just talking with others about it).
8281,"If theres anyone out there like me, who doesn't have any money, and therefore cannot go to a doctor to get help from anxiety troubles, or a therapist who can help talk out what's going on, there's a book that I've found has already helped me so very much."
8282,"When I moved out here to CA, I found a program through a university where you could sign up for cognitive behavioral therapy and work with a grad student and licensed Psychologist."
8283,"Ideally, I'd like to be seeing a professional counselor/therapist regularly, but I can't afford to yet."
8284,But for exposure therapy I still need my xanax pill.
8285,"Around the age of 21, I decided I had been on Paxil long enough so I spoke with my doctor about coming off it and instead talking to a psychiatrist and maybe trying therapy - this was during a particularly bad bout of depression wherein I couldn't even find the energy to get out of bed."
8286,Hi so i've been off and on medication and seeing therapists for anxiety/ocd for years now.
8287,I'm about to start CBT with a therapist for my body dysmorphic disorder and axiety/eating disorders.
8288,"I've been around the block a bit with therapists and am a long-time sufferer of an anxiety disorder (12+ years, woo)."
8289,"I know that every therapist you call will claim to be adept at handling anxiety disorders, but I'd really love to find someone who is the Dr. House of anxiety disorders in my area."
8290,"Maybe that hope is a little high, but I still wouldn't mind suggestions in finding some of the best, most highly specialized therapists/psychologists in treating anxiety disorders."
8291,"I can certainly brute force the problem, and just start calling every therapist listed in the yellow pages or my insurance directory, but maybe there is an even better way to start this search."
8292,My SO and I are going to couples therapy soon to hopefully fix the sexual side effects since they are mainly mental for me.
8293,"Hi... (kinda new to Reddit)
I'm looking for people who'd be willing to describe their experiences with therapy dealing with panic disorder."
8294,"Vocal therapy is somewhat helping, but with the jobs I have now (working at two restaurants; no longer had the voice or confidence to lead a room of kids) it's hard to find time to vocally rest."
8295,"I have therapy, but I do not have anyone personally close to help reassure me that my thoughts are toxic and everything will be ok. Nobody's telling me that things are ok, so the one thing I'm pretty confident in is that nothing is ok.

TL;DR - Long vent about nothing going right."
8296,I have my first therapy session next week but I can't wait that long.
8297,I should also mention I will be seeing a therapist (psychologist) as well to help me along with my process.
8298,"Hello again, I thought I'd drop in a progress update on my no medication therapy for Post traumatic stress disorder, Social anxiety disorder, and general anxiety disorder."
8299,I was put into therapy when I was 7.
8300,Switched to a CBT therapist when I was 8.
8301,I got another therapist when I was 15 (keeping the old one).
8302,About 3 years ago I made some breakthroughs with therapy and got much better.
8303,"Anyway, back to the title: I don't have and cannot afford insurance to get more therapy and medication that I desperately need."
8304,I'm finally back in therapy (had to stop for awhile after I lost insurance).
8305,"I'm currently on no meds, as I've had several therapists and doctors inform me there's nothing to help my particular mix of issues (anxiety pills would make me too suicidal, depression pills would make me too anxious, etc.)."
8306,"I've been working on dealing with a lot of emotional issues in therapy, but we haven't dealt with a lot of coping techniques yet."
8307,"I'm planning on talking to my therapist about this on Saturday, but I thought I'd ask in case any of you had suggestions as well."
8308,"The exams went ok.

Now reflecting, I was wondering if I should seek help like therapy?"
8309,I see a therapist and thought I'd offer my exposure exercise for this phobia as I really do think it's helping and is the right approach to such fears/phobias.
8310,Takes anti-depressants and sees a therapist regularly.
8311,Started seeing a therapist of my own about 8 months ago to work through some of the hurt.
8312,My therapist only helped so much...
8313,Since seeing a therapist I have absolutely zero fear getting onto a train.
8314,"I tried therapy soon after her death, but the therapist at Kaiser simply put me on Paxil after talking to me for less than an hour."
8315,"As a result, I have been wary of therapy."
8316,"I know that people on here have said that you can ""shop around"" for a therapist, but I have no idea where to even start with that."
8317,I have just started working with a psychologist and therapist to overcome a severe depressive episode combined with generalized anxiety.
8318,"After I got back from work, I told my boyfriend about my awful day and how I think I should probably see a therapist."
8319,"I have had loads of therapy (including cognitive behavioral), but all my skills went out the window in this moment."
8320,"I have therapy-gifted rationalization skills, but they weren't working right then."
8321,"Every time I think about telling my therapist about everything, I over think every possible aspect until I'm about to snap."
8322,"I took medicine, went to a therapist, et cetera."
8323,I'm guessing your suggestion is to go to a therapist..but I feel so fucking stupid.
8324,He prescribed me 10 days worth of lorazapam until I see my primary doctor to discuss me seeing a therapist.
8325,I know its not good to take pills but the feeling of not being completely hopeless and depressed is worth it for now at lease until I can get help from a therapist or try a green card or something.
8326,So which therapy method did you guys find more helpful?
8327,I'm going to a psychiatrist for my anxiety and she said she wanted to try exposure therapy.
8328,It was so hard for me to even admit/comprehend that I might actually need therapy.
8329,"I finally took the time to google how to get a therapist and even called Kaiser to find out if it's covered by my insurance, and it is, thank God."
8330,I begin physiotherapy.
8331,I was really happy that my appointment with the school therapist was today only to find that she will be out till Friday.
8332,"&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;  
  
### CBT
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
Cognitive behavioral therapy combined with meditation is a great tool in identifying your anxieties, and working through the ones you have the capacity to change mentally."
8333,"There is a ton of info on CBT, techniques, etc, so I recommend you read up or go see a therapist."
8334,"-- tiredness (perceived)
-- tiredness (but more apparent, physical)
-- not feeling good after exercise, but rather hypersensitive of soreness/fatigue and thus anxious (this is my least favorite, b/c when I first had anxiety I used exercise as my top therapy and don't remember ever getting anxious or super fatigued from it)
-- feeling like I need to escape...snap out of it (this went away recently, thank God!)"
8335,"I've seen a therapist but can't afford to keep seeing him, so I'm relying on reading and peace of mind, as well as perserverence."
8336,I have been in therapy since I was 13.
8337,I have overcome emetophobia and had a wonderful 2 years out of therapy and seemed to have control.
8338,I'm beginning cognitive behavior therapy with my school's counseling program so I really hope it helps.
8339,I should really get into therapy over my general anxiety and social anxiety but I just don't want to.
8340,"I don't want to spill my heart and soul out to a therapist only for it to not work out and I have to do the same thing with a new person, over and over."
8341,"I was diagnosed with anxiety in late 2013, Asperger's in September 2014, and have gone through therapy for Emetophobia (which caused frequent anxiety/panic attacks and still affects me on a smaller scale after therapy)."
8342,I'm due to see my therapist soon about Thanatophobia (fear of death) / Chronophobia (fear of the future - I don't think there's a better term?)
8343,"My therapist unofficially diagnosed me with health anxiety during my last therapy sessions, along with official diagnosis for social and GAD."
8344,"That stuff I can kinda handle, but the main reason why i went to therapy was because i suppressed a very traumatic experience."
8345,"my Father died very suddenly, again i wont go into massive details, but trust me nobody needs to see something like that, nor do they want to take all the feelings from such a thing and push them down for 10 plus years 

Now i've talked about that night in therapy many times and it hurt a lot , but it helped 

I feel as if i've talked about every thing i needed to, all of that stuff just doesn't hurt as bad, but yet I can't seem to let go of it, I guess my question is : how did you guys just move on ?"
8346,"Since I can't be open about it with most people (excluding my SO and therapist), I tend to feel really disconnected from everyone."
8347,"I have an appointment later on this afternoon with a therapist, so I plan on bringing all of this up."
8348,"This is the first time that I've ever seen a therapist, so i don't really no what to expect."
8349,Profs and therapist from years ago: thank you so much for insulting me backhandedly.
8350,"My sister Sam has suffered from severe depression and anxiety throughout the past ten years, but took medication and went to therapy to deal with it."
8351,"I'm in therapy, and it helps to be able to talk about it all, but so far the mindfulness techniques, meditation, B-vitamins, and Vit D supplements are only allowing me to hold back the real tide of anxiety."
8352,"I went back to school in Chicago thinking that I had gotten better (diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, given lexipro and talk therapy)."
8353,No therapy options are available to me.
8354,I've been going to therapy for a few years now and I don't feel any better than when I started.
8355,"I have scheduled a few appointments with psychologists, psychiatrists, and therapists to try and solve whatever the fuck I have."
8356,My therapist was able to describe exactly what it is my brain is doing - she explained it as having symptoms of both generalized anxiety disorder as well as OCD - but instead of the more bizarre compulsive side to OCD my compulsions lay in my thoughts themselves - basically I get really anxious about something and I keep thinking I have to keep thinking about it or something bad will happen if I don't.
8357,I had to see a therapist for three different sessions regarding the issue.
8358,"Talking to the therapist felt really good, but my parents seem to think his ideas were a bit crazy."
8359,"Like I said, my few therapy sessions at school felt great, but I'm too afraid of seeking out help at home, returning to the therapist at school, or even discussing it with anyone at the moment."
8360,"I just started going to a new therapist a couple weeks ago and she gave me some of those little self-assessment quiz things and like half the ""symptoms"" I have weren't even on there."
8361,I can't tell my therapist anything because I just can't talk when I'm there.
8362,It's been this way with every therapist I've seen.
8363,"I can't come up with a script for telling my therapist that I've been suicidal and self-harming, so I am silent."
8364,"I'm just really upset that I'm going to a therapist for ""anxiety"" when there are a lot more problems and that I literally can't even engage my vocal cords on most of her questions."
8365,"Since then my therapist has been changing my entire view on the world, totally turning it upside down."
8366,"One day everything goes right and I have no anxiety whatsoever (whether due to meds, God, luck, therapy, I don't know) and it makes me uncomfortable."
8367,"I've been in therapy a lot, mostly group therapy programs which helped me relax slightly, especially dance movement therapy and vocal yoga, but the individual therapy was a complete fail."
8368,"did the therapy thign for a while, but kinda broke up with my therapist after it wasn't going anywhere for months."
8369,"I ended up dropping out around 12, I would get up in the middle of class and walk home, and my family and therapists could do nothing to help me."
8370,"I did this all on my own, without the help of medications or therapy."
8371,My therapist is great.
8372,So I made a step and have scheduled an appointment with a therapist for anxiety issues which happens to be tomorrow.
8373,What is therapy like?
8374,I'm guessing there are different methods and therapists but what is general therapy like?
8375,Also my therapist on her website says she uses adlerian therapy.
8376,The worst part is-- I'm a therapist!
8377,I'm in my own therapy.
8378,As a bit of personal therapy I have commented on a lot of your posts recently trying to give any advice I might be able to give which has hopefully helped you and has helped (not much but a little) myself.
8379,"I don't really take anything, and don't go to therapy."
8380,Half the time I don't even wanna get out of bed and I'm just feeling kinda worthless and that makes me anxious :( I've been wanting to see a therapist but idk what to say to them.
8381,"I had no idea I had a disorder, but this disorder also caused me severe depression which eventually brought me to see a therapist."
8382,"I don't know if it's a therapist or a psychiatrist or whatever, I just know I have an appointment with someone tomorrow."
8383,I'm not afraid of therapists or anything.
8384,I think it might be because I don't think I'd be into the whole therapy thing.
8385,"I've been seeing an awesome therapist, I'm on great meds, and I basically just have a much healthier approach to stress."
8386,"Considering hypnotherapy, but I'm not sure if it would be helpful or just a bunch of mumbo jumbo."
8387,My only problem is that I am on my parents medical insurance (and have waived my university insurance fee) and neither of them believe in mental illness and think all therapists are crazy and just lie to get money...
8388,"I am 19 so it isn't a matter of being a minor but I am still on their insurance so if I find a therapist they would find out and relentlessly tell me there is nothing wrong with me and I just need to toughen up and ""get over myself""."
8389,I met a new psychologist for the first time on Monday this week and her task/role in all of this is to figure out which anxiety disorders and/or mood disorders I've got before I get to start therapy (this week we talked a lot about OCD which is one disorder they suspect I might have).
8390,I know it'll come up--I do see a therapist and I'm on an antidepressant and have a Xanax prescription.
8391,"I do like my therapist and she is helpful, but I'd also like to hear from people who know exactly how this feels."
8392,My dad took me to the doctor and I started medication and therapy.
8393,My doctor won't prescribe me a benzo (anti-panic medication) and I can't afford therapy right now.
8394,"I know this is the right thing to do, and I've been going to therapy every week for years, recently seeking help about my fear of this appointment, but I just can't get over it."
8395,I tried different medicines and therapy when I was a kid and they didn't really change anything anyway.
8396,"However, I can't really convince her to try something else for me, or you know, MENTAL THERAPY, because, well, that would be just SILLY... /s

Since neither my counselor nor my doctor think I should get a therapist I can't get one until I'm 18 and FINALLY have some control over my own well being."
8397,"So, after I went to the ER, and had another Dr. visit, she prescribed Buspar, and suggested I see a therapist."
8398,"I saw a therapist last Thursday, but was 30 minutes late because of an anxiety attack."
8399,After a few years of good therapy I and my therapist agree I am ready for [EMDR](http://drkathleenyoung.wordpress.com/2010/03/15/emdr-what-exactly-happens-during-the-8-phases) after years of wanting to try this and having to agree I was not ready.
8400,Current therapist does not do it so had to call around to find one and this is the big thing - I made the phone calls myself and didn't get my Mother to do it for me!!!
8401,"Turns out someone my current therapist did not know was available at the center I go to is and so all worry about totally new situation was wasted worry :p

Met and like the therapist and only went up to a 6 even when discussing a few traumatic events."
8402,Helped old therapist was there to help ease the meeting.
8403,Didn't panic or dissociate when discussing a trauma which new therapist noticed and indicated I should be able to get into the treatment part of emdr quickly.
8404,Some folks have to do the preparation phase for several months but I already learned a lot of that stuff from the current therapist.
8405,So next week is my first session with the new therapist and I am so happy &amp; excited as well as anxious and scared.
8406,No therapy atm (therapy sent me so far backwards - I've only improved by tackling my anxiety myself).
8407,"I'm in therapy, which helps, but the problem is obviously not going to go away."
8408,"All I can do right now is continue with therapy and try to send the samples to a lab for analysis, but I still have to deal with doctors and just people I come across meeting me with skepticism."
8409,She agreed to restart her therapy (had her 1st session yesterday) but it gives her anxiety to be there or even to think about going.
8410,I am afraid she will reject the therapy again if she continues to get anxious from it.
8411,"Her therapist believes that she does not ""trust herself"" and seems to cling to me for safety."
8412,"I've been to hospital, seen doctors and therapists and have made some progress on the road to feeling more calm every day."
8413,"But as I had learnt from my therapy session, I slowly began to accept this fact."
8414,"They keep trying to give me therapy ""tools"" to ""cope"" with my anxiety."
8415,Diagnosis and therapy and meds came soon after.
8416,"Despite years of therapy and meds, I never could prevent or control my panic attacks."
8417,I was in therapy for years (for mostly the anxiety) and never really felt like I got anywhere.
8418,"I'm open to any advice, suggestions, therapy techniques... anything."
8419,"Today I had an appointment with my doctor regarding my generalized anxiety, it was my psychologist that pushed me to make an appointment as the therapy hasn't been working to well on me."
8420,I know there's not a lot of actual therapists on reddit but any consolation/advice is much appreciated.
8421,And this is all on the heels of realizing how far I've come in the past year in terms of treatment and therapy and managing my panic and anxiety attacks and I understand that it's a day to day thing but I just still feel so freaked out and physically terrible today.
8422,"If it is any important, I go to therapy and am diagnosed with depression and social anxiety, and am about to get antidepressants next week."
8423,"I haven't seen my therapist in over a year, and I have been (unwillingly) off medication for the same amount of time."
8424,"I've tried getting help through the city I live in, but the only kind of help I can get requires me to go to group therapy every Friday."
8425,"Which is fine and dandy, but a. I work that day (every week), and I can't just leave for a quick therapist session and b. I have social anxiety and I couldn't even tell the truth to my therapist, I don't even fucking know how I'd function in a group."
8426,And they couldn't even promise me that I'd see a therapist after I went through six weeks of group therapy.
8427,"Two years ago when I started seeing my current therapist, I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression."
8428,"Right now he is on 40mg of Flouxetine, and he did a little therapy but it was just too difficult to get him to go (and too expensive when he would skip and insurance wouldn't cover it)."
8429,"I'm interested in therapy AND medication because the problem has gotten so extreme and is having physical effects (I can feel it in my heart, lungs and feel shaky, and constantly on edge) How should I go about doing so, and in the mean-time what can I do to alleviate the issue?"
8430,"My father was a severe manic depressive, bipolar - to the point where he did mental hospital stays and even shock therapy that lasted months."
8431,"I recently found the Goldilocks of meds/therapy for my anxiety, but I'm 34 and feel like I've missed all the important events in a normal persons life."
8432,"The few therapists I've tried to explain this to usually drop words like ""personality disorder"" or ""low self esteem"" but don't really have much to tell me other than to take an antianxiety or antidepressant."
8433,"I saw therapists for years and was prescribed way too many anti-anxiety medications, all of which did nothing to help me."
8434,"Medication doesn't work, therapy doesn't help."
8435,"I sought a therapist for a while and did some CBT, but it never really took."
8436,I doubt they'd send me to a therapist.
8437,I don't know if I'd want to be send to a therapist.
8438,"My therapist suggested, ""Best case scenario, you get out of the anesthesia with flying colors and this greatly boosts your recovery!"
8439,"I have a doctor's appointment in a couple of weeks and will definitely bring up my issues then, but I'm not sure if a need a therapist, medicine (which I'm a bit afraid of due to side effects), or a different diet perhaps?"
8440,I'm also now awaiting to hear from a therapist in the near future.
8441,"Hi,

I have a generalized anxiety disorder for about 2 years and have been in therapy for a 2 months now."
8442,Finally I was taken to a therapist and after two sessions I was prescribed 150 mg of Zoloft.
8443,"I was in therapy years (10+) ago as a teenager for anxiety-depression related issues, and I know now that panic disorders run in the family, and I'm currently looking to see someone about it because I am seriously fed up."
8444,"I'm 18 years old, I have a girlfriend, I've dealt with anxiety for (as said by my therapist) from a very young age."
8445,"Therapy (2 therapists so far) has been a joke and believe you me I have tried, so hard, I've worked and left my comfort zones for just a day of normalcy."
8446,I guessed im scared of therapy in general and don't know which therapist to choose.
8447,So I went to therapy.
8448,My social anxiety has gotten better since summer began and I left therapy.
8449,I've been seeing a therapist and she is super awesome and helpful but I am curious about a few things that have been happening to me recently and was curious if anyone could give me some insight.
8450,She said maybe I am hypo or hyperglycemic or something and when talking to my therapist she said maybe I do have a minor medical condition I should check out that might be trigger my anxiety (I'm going to go check that out when I'm home).
8451,"A few months ago I tried Zoloft for the first time, but went through some terrible side effects with it and it completely deterred me from trying any other medication leaving me to try talk therapy which was great at first but the anxiety just came back."
8452,"On top of that, my therapist is on vacation for the next week or so."
8453,"I feel like my general unprompted anxiety is starting to come back as well, too.I see a therapist regularly, and at our last session I had a full blown panic attack."
8454,"I can't keep asking people to stay here with me, my husband going to a later shift is not an option, and we don't have the money for therapy or medication."
8455,I don't want to self diagnose and I am scared to bring it up to my therapist because it seems silly to me.
8456,How can I go about talking to my therapist about this without feeling stupid?
8457,I went to a doctor and she gave me a list of therapists in my area.
8458,"I feel like by going to therapy I'm admitting that I'm crazy and that I have a problem, there's no going back after I commit."
8459,"I know going to therapy doesn't make someone crazy, I'm just really afraid and upset about it all."
8460,"I think she's a good therapist, but we've had some issues over the last couple of months and I've come to resent her, which doesn't make for a very good patient/therapist relationship."
8461,"I may seek treatment with another therapist at some point, but right now I feel like this isn't a healthy situation."
8462,"I'm supposed to have an appointment with her tomorrow morning, but 1) I don't really want to go to/pay for a session just to stop therapy and 2) every time I go see her and try to stop therapy she talks me back in."
8463,That was a couple months ago and I'm still in therapy.
8464,"I've tried sleeping pills, meditation, CBT therapy, light therapy and I'm currently seeing a psychologist who is working with me on mindfulness therapy, but so far I'm a little skeptical."
8465,I had to beg to go to therapy and I went for a few sessions before my therapist suggested I get a physical evaluation because she was concerned I might have a physiological problem (most of my extreme episodes of depression/anxiety were triggered by the use of birth control pills and I also experience a lot of strange GI symptoms and female-parts symptoms).
8466,I used some relaxation techniques that I learned in therapy but my parents wouldn't pay for me to return to it.
8467,"I finally returned to therapy after I basically told my parents ""it's therapy or death"", and seeing as how I had come completely unwound they reluctantly agreed."
8468,I have been attending therapy for four months.
8469,"I want to hear your success stories, I want to hope, because in therapy I feel often that I am building a house of cards that falls down every month."
8470,"(30M) I started seeing a therapist for it all, and it definitely helps, but man it seems so hard to ""snap out of it"" once it takes over."
8471,What can my therapist disclose?
8472,"I've been seeing a therapist once a week for almost two months, but that doesn't even help anymore."
8473,"He recently began treatment (started Celexa, I believe, about 2 months ago), and will enter therapy in the new year."
8474,I see a therapist bi-weekly for help with anxiety/depression.
8475,"I went to therapy, group therapy and a psychiatrist, I learned DBT and CBT, I practiced yoga, and learned breathing techniques."
8476,"No medical tests have provided any conclusions, meds havent worked, CBT, counselling, acupuncture, exposure therapy."
8477,"After months of visiting a therapist with little to no progress, I went to the psychiatrist and was prescribed medication for my anxiety and depression."
8478,Now I'm really scared about having to call it off with my therapist since I'll be an hour away and I don't drive.
8479,My therapist is one of my favorite people on the planet.
8480,I've been to a therapist a few times about this.
8481,I finally gave in and let my therapist &amp; doctor prescribe me an antidepressant plus xanax.
8482,"I've been in therapy for a few months and I'm feeling like I'm done, like I'm ""cured""."
8483,I began seeing a therapist who only wasted my time.
8484,"I've never heard it talked about on this subreddit, or even in years of therapy talking with my psychologist."
8485,"I had seen a therapist about this for a few sessions over the summer, but nothing really came out of it, as I couldn't afford to go regularly."
8486,And I'm afraid therapy won't work/is too expensive.
8487,"On Thursday after I left therapy, I was seating in the car, and realized what was going on, I started to cry, because I never thought things could change, I never thought I was going to say ""I'm great"", and mean it."
8488,"My therapist says I need to be more blunt about telling people to leave me alone, but my brain is afraid that they will go stage nine psychopath on me if I do that."
8489,My therapist calls this symptoms of a child of an alcoholic.
8490,I am currently seeing a therapist and will bring this up next week but I don't know what I can do in the meantime.
8491,Can therapy help this?
8492,"I would like to hear opinions about therapy, how it works, what should i expect, when should i think about changing the therapist."
8493,"* After my postman job i started to see psychotherapist, but it was kinda difficult for me, because i was passed from one specialist to another, so for some time i felt very uneasy about that."
8494,"And now to the main story (there goes the ""short introduction""... :D)

Starting to attend to therapy was definetly a turning point in my life, because i started to crack my defensive shell and let out my fears and feelings, which loudly expressed didn't seemed as dreadfull as i prevously thought."
8495,"The first thing i noticed about the therapy: 95% of work is done by me, the therapist intervenes only little, mostly just to change the direction of conversation."
8496,The first half year of my therapy was great.
8497,"And this was a mayor change in my therapy, because until then, the therapy was done in calm conditions, but now i was in the middle of a storm."
8498,"And then i started to realise, that i am getting almost no support from my therapist."
8499,"The only real commitment i felt from him, was that he was willing to lower the fee for therapy, so i am not froced to quit therapy."
8500,"I was so frustrated with my relatives and, in a way, with therapist, that i posted my very first ""cry for help"" on internet."
8501,"What was I doing in therapy for all this time?” It got me in a very uneasy situation, because from one side, I have finaly got some clarification about my feelings and fears, that had pressured me for the whole of my life."
8502,"At that time (one year ago) I was so suspicious about my therapist intentions and possible secret agendas, that I decided to ask for an advice from a person I was familiar with, who was also a therapist."
8503,"The reponse I got from her stated, that therapy is a long term process and also mentioned the progress of my therapy, because I am starting to change my views."
8504,"I didnt anymore had the pressure for an improvement in therapy, soI continued to see the same therapist."
8505,"I was encouraged by the thought, that now, that I finally could point out possible reasons for particular cause of anxiety, I believed, that I will be able to sort them out with my therapist and “neutralize” the worry once and for all."
8506,"But the more thoughts I documented and tried to discuss them with therapist, the more frustrated I became after every session, because I was unable to go through my written thoughts with my therapist – more and more of my thoughts was left untouched."
8507,"And even if I managed to describe any particular thought to my therapist, I was most of the times missing any feedback."
8508,"It come to a point, that I was starting to get anxious, wether if my therapist even pays the attention that I am telling him."
8509,"I almost felt, like  the therapy was about expressing my feelings."
8510,"Sure, it not always talking about nothing, very often I get important conclusions about myself, but I continue to feel, that I could achieve much more in areas more actual in my everyday life, if  I discused the trending topics with therapist."
8511,I dont feel that the therapist is showing enough interest or initiation.
8512,"I feel, that I had shown any initiation from myself, but followed the flow set by therapist, I probably would still talk about my upper layer day-by-day feelings and experiences without touching the deep waters."
8513,"Sure, those therapies help, but I often get similar relief, when I talk to relatives I trust, but I dont pay them 45 euros per hour."
8514,Another thing that bothers me is not getting any encouragement in therapy.
8515,"My problem with therapist is, that I have stated countless times, that I would like to avoid working in a company under a supervision and that I am trying to working on my own way to earn living."
8516,Yet I am getting almost no interest (and absolutely no encouragement) from my therapist.
8517,"There has been only one occasion in two years or therapy, when he has showed any interest on what I was working on, and I still think it was only because I was talking about that to him at that particular session."
8518,"And in a chapter, where she describes, how to recover from that mind state, she pointed out several things, what to consider, when someone wants to get help in therapy."
8519,"And she has especially pointed out, that it is important to get feedback and encouragement from therapist."
8520,"And because I am having a threat of losing financial support in few months time, I feel, that maybe general therapy isnt enough and that I maybe should consider to look for a more direct therapy treatment?"
8521,"Sorry for the long wall of text :|

TL DR: I, who suffers from anxiety disorder and low self-esteem, am seeing the same therapist for 2 years, yet i feel, that i get very little feedback and almost none encouragement, which, as i have recently found, is almost essential to recover from low self-esteem."
8522,I never needed treatment by a therapist or doctor or anything.
8523,"I go see my therapist every 2 weeks and we talk and she tells me the usual CBT stuff, I can listen to it, I can understand it, but I can't seem to use it practically."
8524,Thursday was my second visit with my therapist.
8525,My first and only therapist I have ever seen.
8526,I go to therapy once a week and it really helps talking.
8527,She's an amazing therapist and I leave the appointment feeling great.
8528,"I've had incredibly bad experiences with therapists (from being an abused child that told a counselor at the age of 9 that i was being abused - who then told the abusor that i was making up stories about them and that they should ""handle that"" - to seeing someone for insomnia and anxiety and having them put me in a psychiatric ward without my permission, and holding me there - which was one of the scariest, worst experiences of my entire life)."
8529,"The lady had a really nasty attitude (like that teenager at the drive through that clearly doesn't want to be working at mcdonalds) from the beginning that put me off, and to be fair - with the level of fear i associate with therapists and psychiatrists, I probably wasn't the most open minded and fair perspective."
8530,"they also apparently only do group sessions of therapy (although i managed to get a singular appt bc the marriage counselor is having a quiet time right now and doesn't have enough people for group therapy at the moment), and they book months in advance."
8531,My sister (29F) has anxiety and depression which she's beginning to address through therapy/meds but needs to start applying for jobs so that she can pay rent etc.
8532,"It's okay it's okay it's okay it's okay just keep telling yourself that and go to therapy tomorrow and TELL YOUR DOCTOR about how you're freaking out, don't hide it or lie about it to seem better than you are."
8533,Haven't seen a therapist since over a year and a half ago (free at my university).
8534,"One thing that I have been told frequently from my doctor and therapist is that the medication I am taking to help cope with the symptoms of my GAD is really only a temporary band-aid, and that if I don't take care of the underlying causes of my anxiety Ill be stuck this way when the medication is over."
8535,"For example my therapist has given me sets of breathing exercises to do (Just breathing with the diaphragm, nothing really special), or ways to distract myself when anxiety is kicking in."
8536,I know therapy will be suggested but I just cannot handle face to face contact or video calls.
8537,"I've been to three different therapists in my life and none of them every brought up bipolar when I was being diagnosed - it's always been the same: GAD, mild OCD, panic disorder, phobia."
8538,I have also tried therapy all that never really went anywhere.
8539,"I have dealt with panic attacks for numerous years, but reduced them significantly with therapy."
8540,"I've talked about it in therapy, I know why I'm scared but I haven't found a successful way of getting rid of the anxiety."
8541,I have been in and out of therapy for both anxiety and depression.
8542,"I took myself off my last medication when I was 17 years old and have been handling my anxiety very well since then..up until recently it just feels like I'm just starting to unravel again, so I have gone back to therapy."
8543,My therapist suggested EMDR and briefly explained what it is.
8544,"I have a hard time trusting this doctor, as she doesn't really know me nearly as well as my therapist and psychologist that I have been seeing."
8545,"I ended up telling my folks and I now have an appointment with a therapist today, though I'm not sure how it's gonna work out in the long run given I'm only here for a couple months."
8546,I take Lexapro to generally help with everything and also receive cognitive behavioral therapy so some day I can stop taking Lexapro.
8547,I also have Ativan for when my learned therapy techniques aren't enough on their own.
8548,I have anxiety medicine and am going to therapy and they only help so much.
8549,"Anyway, I want to go into research for my long term career but exposure therapy obviously hasn't helped, and I will have to get used to giving presentations."
8550,"I really don't mind being alone as far as people goes, but I guess I'm uncomfortable with myself though that's there whether I'm with folks or not, and I fully intend to continue to bring this up in therapy."
8551,"I've been coping with anxiety for the past couple of months, and I've tried everything, from meds to therapy to meditation, to make it less bad."
8552,I've been in therapy for over a year for mild anxiety issues but only in recent months have I been experiencing full blown panic attacks.
8553,"22 year old male, had minor and shortterm therapy but it didnt help a whole lot and money was an issue."
8554,"I've had anxiety for a long time now, and I've tried therapy but the therapist I went to wouldn't have a session more than 20 minutes."
8555,"I'm looking into going back to therapy but the new place needs me to contact my last therapist for my paperwork, but I'm afraid to ask the past therapist for it because I don't want to explain why I'm going to someone else."
8556,"My own mom refuses therapy and medication, and turns to my dad instead, and insists it won't help me."
8557,I have been going through exposure therapy and I know I have been very slowly making progress and recovering.
8558,"Things I have tried (which my therapist recommended): Breathing deeply, trying to give myself a boost of confidence, etc."
8559,"It still went okay, I talked with my ex about things, she encouraged me to find a therapist here and consoled me."
8560,"I took half of it (50mg) and tomorrow I'm going to buy a pack (without a doctor's orders but it's not like there was a lot of check ups earlier either, I got my original prescription from an ER doctor who I saw twice afterwards...)

I'm pretty sure I won't be able to get state-funded therapy since I'm not willing to delve so deep in despair that their thresholds would be filled."
8561,I'm going to my second therapy session tomorrow so hopefully that will help.
8562,"Scared I have cancer, a tumor, I'll need surgery, chemotherapy... whatever."
8563,"I'm taking steps into solving my anxiety and depression through therapy, but I am super worried about my current health."
8564,"I have now been speaking with a therapist weekly, and while it was hard to admit I needed help initially, I'm so glad I took that step."
8565,My therapy has taught me that it's usually the waiting around and the build up to an event that causes more grief than the actual event itself.
8566,"I'm starting a cognitive behavioral therapy later in this month and I really hope that my nightmares will decrease :(

I don't want my dreams to happen inside of disgusting murderous-poltergeist-SAW horror movies."
8567,"I usually call it my ""hangover"" feeling when discussing it with docs and therapist."
8568,"This beginning of this year, I put myself into therapy at the college I attend because it was free."
8569,"Second, there is no magic pill, instant cure, or marvelous therapy that would make the panic attacks just stop."
8570,"I saw a therapist briefly while I was in high school, but it didn't make any long term impact."
8571,I also hear the notion that using meds is equivalaent to giving up on improving yourself through hard work and therapy.
8572,It should be utilized in conjunction with therapy as an effective means to develop better coping skills and better techniques to deal with difficult situations.
8573,Sometimes it's just too overwhealming to deal with everything head on and expect therapy to take hold when the symptoms of anxiety are so intense.
8574,"I'm only on my second session and we haven't gotten into my extremely negative body image (a huge source of my anxieties, for sure) and my fixation on it, but it struck me as a bit odd that a therapist would say this."
8575,"I've never visited a therapist before so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'd always assumed that a therapist was an objective voice on the issues and wouldn't usually comment directly on something like that, especially when it's such a volatile topic."
8576,My mental health collapsed and I'm being summoned home by my parents and therapist.
8577,"I'm on a (forced by parents and therapist) vacation until mid-April in a third state, so all I can do from here is freak out and panic."
8578,"I am medicated, have CBT and see a therapist once every two weeks."
8579,Ive recently decided I am going to seek therapy because I have been feeling anxiety and depression more than ever given the level of stress in my life from career and family issues.
8580,"There is a 2 month wait everywhere else, which I expect if he refers me to a talk therapist."
8581,Should I seek out some kind of therapy?
8582,"Whether it be medication, therapy, or whatever."
8583,My SO also suffers from anxiety and right now I’m looking into ways to help both of us deal with it until we can talk to someone [ie: a therapist] about ways to cope.
8584,"I go to a therapist about every two weeks, but it seems to never get better."
8585,Note: I do see a therapist.
8586,I do have a question though: what are things I can do to help my anxiety other than seeing a therapist and medication?
8587,"I was in the emergency of a psychiatric institution yesterday and the doc there told me to go to a psychotherapist, but she couldn't help me with the withdrawal."
8588,"The therapist I've been going to for a couple months now suggested today that I might have OCD, which I had never really considered, despite my interest in abnormal psychology."
8589,"It's the first time my therapist has put a title on my anxiety, and that, for whatever reason, is really scary to me."
8590,"I talked to a nurse friend, she is going to recommend a psychiatrist/therapist."
8591,"Right now I do a little bit of ACT therapy work most days (triple column method from ""Feeling Good"") and I meditate for maybe 15 minutes every other day."
8592,"Since then, I've been seeing a psychiatrist and going to therapy weekly."
8593,"I'm on medication (celexa daily &amp; klonopin when needed), and the combination of the meds and therapy has me feeling great."
8594,"After many months of therapy and medication and searching desperately for the quick fix, I came across this site last week (http://anxietynomore.co.uk/), created by a man named Paul David, and read his book called At Last a Life."
8595,"Well, I have been thinking of getting therapy for a while now, but I don't have insurance."
8596,"I have been looking at low cost options, and have narrowed it down to a couple universities near me that have low cost counseling/therapy (performed by grad/phd students)."
8597,I was wondering if anyone has gone this route for therapy and if they found it helpful.
8598,"I'm also pretty nervous about even making the appointment, you have to call and do a 30 minute assessment so they can determine if ""you are appropriate for our counseling/therapy services and the services that will best serve your needs""-which makes total sense, but just the thought of making that call activates the black hole in my stomach."
8599,Psychotherapist?
8600,"I am not currently seeing a therapist (however, I have tried CBT in the past, but I'm willing to try again)."
8601,Should I give therapy another shot?
8602,I was told by a therapist I wasn't going to be able to play guitar at my friends' wedding.
8603,I was going to move out but my SO left me and my therapy bills have drained me.
8604,"Even if it is, I just want to have some therapist of meds."
8605,Probably therapy first.
8606,I have seen a couple different therapists at my university and they didn't help at all.
8607,My health insurance doesn't cover mental health benefits so I can't see a therapist outside of school.
8608,I'm not really sure why I went to reddit with this but I feel like it might help in some way to have people hear me out...also thinking of going to therapy soon...thanks for reading guys.
8609,"I know I need to go to therapy but it's hard to get one here where I live, so I need something to help me on the meanwhile."
8610,"I am an 18 year old female with social anxiety and borderline-personality disorder, and I am currently taking Topamax for my BPD and I see a therapist once a week."
8611,I want him to help support me emotionally but I also know he's not a therapist and shouldn't have to constantly be one.
8612,"I just am really confused and need some advice 

Also thankfully I will be seeing a therapist this summer so hopefully that will help things out as well."
8613,"I really want to see a therapist or something now that my pills aren't working, but my mother's already spending so much money on a counselor for my autistic brother."
8614,"I have just recently started seeing a therapist I really like, but I need help coping in the interim."
8615,I understand and risks of benzo's and I am seeing a therapist but its getting to the point when I'm scared of what I might do if I don't try something drastic.
8616,"I have done cognitive behavioral therapy and psychiatric help, but still struggle daily with my moods and general anxiety over everything in life, positive and negative."
8617,I called two therapists to try to schedule some kind of appointment/do a phone consultation; neither have responded after 2 business days.
8618,Calling a therapist was a really big step for me and now I just feel discouraged as fuck :(
8619,"this causes me to do many things i often turn over and over and over in my head when im trying to sleep
- I've seen about this- 2 therapists (one currently), 2 psychiatrists, 1 natropath, 1 Bio-meridian doctor (high-tech chinese medicine, they told me my biological pathways were inflamed, and that my body was so malnourished, it started to eat itself- this was when i really wasnt eating ANYTHING at all)
-My entire family has struggled with it at some point or another, my brother is a daily smoker for the same reason, my dad has told me a great deal about his experience, and it still affects him daily, my sister has attempted suicide because of it, and many of my mom's family members are affected by it."
8620,"When I think back throughout the times I smoked the anxiety I had but was crazy but I never knew what it was, only after 3 years I gave it up I went to a therapist and got diagnosed with anxiety disorder."
8621,"Since then I have been through programs, several college attempts, community college attempts, Outward Bound expeditions, KNOLS expeditions, and lots of therapy."
8622,"I feel like I hear about a new type of therapy everyday; CBT, Humanistic, Meditation, Experimental, Hypnotism, Existentialism...

What methods have you seen work (personally or through family/friends)?"
8623,"Most of the time these are psychologists and psychotherapists who are covered by health insurance, so they are not particularly motivated and probably deal with drug addicts and alcoholics a lot."
8624,"Also, having lost the job, I have no money for some sketchy therapy that may or may not work."
8625,Does anyone know about this or what its called so I can ask my therapist about it?
8626,"I was told I had anxiety almost 5 years ago, but not prescribed anything or referred to a therapist/counselor."
8627,In my childhood I had a brain tumor and had radiation therapy to treat it.
8628,&gt; This concept saved me from a mental breakdown on multiple occasions and from paying for a therapist.
8629,"I also started seeing a therapist by that time and I was responding better to therapy and medications (Wellbutrin)

Sorry if my post is getting too verbose."
8630,"I am gonna see my therapist soon bc Ive been off my meds and my anxiety is getting  worse again, but I don’t want to be prescribed xanax anymore after my experiences last year."
8631,"A few years ago I took an SSRI for social anxiety, and after six months of that and 2ish years of therapy, my social anxiety disappeared."
8632,"I'm on the waiting books for a psychiatrist and therapist, but it's taking a long time to even get a consultation with anyone and I feel like I need to vent."
8633,"I've dodging therapy for the longest time, but I feel that I am finally at the bottom."
8634,"My question really is then, how can I tell my parents that I need therapy for anxiety/depression without letting them know the extent of my problems?"
8635,"I already had to take a medical leave of absence to go to treatment, and I'm only managing to scrape by with an enormous amount of support (therapy 3x/week, academic support 5 hours/week and weekly DBT group.)"
8636,"(BTW, I'm seeing a therapist and on medication."
8637,"I was in therapy and on meds (most you could name) for most of my teens, but gave them up when they weren't helping at around 18."
8638,"Also, I may try therapy again too, but I've done it plenty and not found it very helpful."
8639,"During this time period I tried:

Seroquel
Xanax
Klonepin
Prozac
Risperidone 
Trazodone
Lithium
Lamotrigine 
Escitalopram

Therapy with a therapist who spent three sessions talking about his methods, not actually assisting me with anything."
8640,"This is the second time it has happened with two different therapists, and it deters me from trying again."
8641,"Its not very bad, like I don't take medicine or anything, however its to the point where I decided to tell my parents about how I've been feeling different and now I go to like a therapist or psychologist once every 2 weeks."
8642,"As a child I had a bad stammer that speech therapy helped me grow out of, but the therapist said not to be surprised if the problem occasionally showed up later in life."
8643,"My parents also made me see a therapist through the later part of elementary school because I would flat out refuse to talk to new people, he too said that anxiety is not something you can erase but instead ""build tools to control."""
8644,"Medication isn't helping, therapy is definitely not helping."
8645,"I don't ""know all the tricks"" (as in ""a therapist seeing another therapist""); I just find them all easily rationalizable/identifiable as such."
8646,"I'm tired of being (implicitly) accused of being actively sabotaging the therapy, as if the CBT was made to fit all kinds of human minds, every failure having to do with the patient's ""unwillingness to comply to its standard."""
8647,"I think lately my anxiety is making me depressed and think it's time to get medicated, my wife thinks that's dumb and says I'm just looking for an answer in a pill and I should just get therapy."
8648,I don't know if therapy would do anything for my anxiety as I feel it's just part of who I am.
8649,What can I do aside from seeing a therapist about this?
8650,"I want to ask you guys: Is cognitive therapy the way to go, or do I need meds as well?"
8651,"As another example, if I see an ad about fighting cancer, I'll automatically start thinking about getting cancer and dying, and it will distract me for long periods of time

I've tried exposure therapy and CBT, but the sudden severity of my OCD makes it hard to deal with."
8652,"I don't want to see a therapist again because the last 2 were really unhelpful and basically just listened to me talk for an hour, for $45/pop."
8653,I don't think I need therapy just yet but damn it if I could just get a friend to hang out with me I think it would help.
8654,One of the things I've tried to do is to reach out to other people--coping skill I learned in therapy that usually works.
8655,My anxiety really went out of control at that point and I started cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to help me get through it.
8656,"Fast forward to 2011, one of the therapist I was seeing at this point suggested that I consider medication, I was insulted."
8657,I have gone to cognitive behavior therapy but it didn't seem to work.
8658,"My parents have encouraged me to seek therapy, and so I have."
8659,"Apparently I do have anxiety, because the way I am doesn't seem ""normal"" to my parents and my therapist, and that must make me...anxious?"
8660,"I haven't even started to work on anything with the therapist yet, they're just getting to know me, but I already feel upset."
8661,"I've been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder in the past, but after some treatment I was weaned off of meds and therapy had become not as useful."
8662,I've always had to struggle with my anxiety and both my therapist and doc said that the Lexapro would help.
8663,"To start off I am looking into seeing a therapist again, and I am still on Zoloft 150mg."
8664,They said that I was fine and that I should see a therapist.
8665,"I remember walking up to the therapist and before seeing anyone I thought ""this is silly."
8666,"I don't need a therapist "" I wish I could go back in time."
8667,I bought some peppermint aromatherapy and started rubbing it on my throat.
8668,"I had a talk therapist for a bit, but I think I just needed time and to trust cars again."
8669,I seem to have *something*--something which is big enough to impact my daily life and have me seek therapy when otherwise I wouldn't bother.
8670,I have seen several therapists over the years and just recently started seeing a new one.
8671,I've told about a handful of therapists but I only see them once - I can't afford to pay someone to ask me how I feel.
8672,"pretended to go on a drinking binge, again just for to be manipulative, lied about everything to my therapist, to my friends, already been lying a lot to my parents but this broke the record."
8673,"told my therapist, he said thats alright."
8674,"so here i am, my next therapist appointment is in a week, and i need something to hold me till then."
8675,I'm also planning to visit my therapist this week along with more regularly scheduled appointments.
8676,"Hi reddit, I had my first therapy session today for severe anxiety, and while I still feel little sparks of happiness every so often that quickly fade away my motivation is shot."
8677,"I've tried every single doctor at my disposal and it came up with nothing, even a cognitive therapist."
8678,I've tried therapy and I'm on medication i take every day for it.
8679,And I am waiting for an anxiety group therapy session to start in October.
8680,"Ive been to therapy, tried CBT but I pretty much just got passed from therapist to therapist and got sick of starting over with a new person."
8681,Plus when I met the doctor at the hospital for medication he was a total asshole (my boyfriend has actually met him as well for different reasons and the doctor treated him the same way) anyway basically Im unable to take medication so therapy was my only option.
8682,After I left therapy I slowly got better on my own.
8683,"The last time I went to a therapist, I blanked out, started mumbling God knows what and left embarrassed and defeated."
8684,I'm actively working on getting better with therapy.
8685,"I'm open with my family, my therapist, etc."
8686,"As a result of having two schizophrenic uncles my family has always stressed good ""mental hygiene"" and the use of therapists."
8687,Literally my parents said going to the therapist should be just as normal and important as going to the dentist.
8688,I have always had a really anxious temperament and have been seeing therapists and psychiatrists on and off for over a decade.
8689,I am currently seeing a therapist (cognitive behavioral therapist) and am going to see a new psychiatrist in early July.
8690,My therapist hadn't been a lot of help but I'm resisting her too.
8691,Are there any recommendations to dealing with anxiety that don't include therapy and medicine?
8692,I've got a therapist through my parents EAP that I'm going to see.
8693,"I've been suffering from anxiety and OCD for about 10 years now (probably more), and am taking my first steps to getting help and therapy."
8694,I am going to go see a therapist I guess i need to get past this anxiety of being social.
8695,Anyone have any luck with certain types of therapist?
8696,my mother finally got off her lazy drunken ass (her drunk attitude also adds to my feelings... more stuff go figure) and gets me a therapist.
8697,"I have been seeing the same therapist for two years, and i have definetly improved in many areas."
8698,"At the same time i have done some self-study to learn more about my condition, and i learned a lot of things i never learned in my therapy."
8699,"So with the dire need to improve myself to be somewhat ready to work, when the time comes, i started to concentrate on the efficiency of my therapy."
8700,"When i started to have specific expectations in therapy, i started to realize, that i fail to discuss the hot topics."
8701,"Instead i  realized, that in therapy sesisons i lose myself in some random thoughts, that, while are somewhat linked to my anxiety, they dont touch the hot topics."
8702,"Another thing, that i miss from my therapist, is an emotional support."
8703,"So i often hoped, that my therapist would validate the fact, that the accusations and demands from my parents were unreasonable, so that i could relieve myself from the guilt of not living my life by following the standards and critiques from my parents."
8704,"And today, during my therapy session, i had an unpleasant surprise, when i realized that i was having a discussion with my therapist about psychological term, because his explanation didn't satisfied me at all."
8705,"So basically i am having doubts about the competency of my therapist and i fear, that the progress in therapy might be too little or even non-existant because of the lack of understanding and competency of my therapist."
8706,So obviously i expect to get the most from the therapy too.
8707,"And when i am in this ""only 100% is acceptable"" mode, i instantly get anxious, when i get a feeling, that my trust is being violated, because my therapist  can't fulfill my ""specific"" expectations and demands from therapy."
8708,"With that said, i am not so sure about the concerns with my therapist, because i realise that i tend to concentrate too much on getting certain previously evaulated results."
8709,I started therapy but I never felt like I clicked with the guy so I stopped going.
8710,I understand CBT is shown to be helpful but I have neither the time nor money to afford therapy.
8711,Or does that come with therapy?
8712,"When I was around 13-14 years old, I was diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder, went to two therapy sessions, and was discharged."
8713,"It's so frustrating, especially when trying to remember things to tell the therapist."
8714,She said that knowing my therapy is going well would reassure her of my improvement.
8715,I plan on telling my parents and seeking therapy or something.
8716,She feels for the time I will need daily therapy and need a driver.
8717,So it finally occurred to me that I can call therapists in the middle of the night when they definitely aren't in their office and definitely won't answer the phone.
8718,I'm in therapy and see and psych this coming Monday but I'm starting to really feel like I'm getting worse and worse and have no where to go.
8719,"I am a very jealous person, (of course I'd never admit that I'm jealous), etc etc...

Oh, and if it helps, I want to be a therapist, and I think I'm fairly good at writing."
8720,"He's getting professional help with both medication as well as therapy, and he is keeping up well with the doctors' advice."
8721,Is this something that I should encourage he bring up with the therapist?
8722,"- I don't exercise very much compared to others, but I'm of a slim/healthy body weight


I have tried:
- hypnotherapy
- a therapist who specialised in phobias
- homeopathic psychologist
- psychiatrist 

and none helped."
8723,"I've been on Lexapro, seeing a therapist, working out, meditating, working on anxieties over the past year+, and I think it has been the most amazing year, I feel I have accomplished so much on a personal level (I started dating for the first time in my life, finally at the start of 2014!"
8724,"I guess I thought I had more time to work with my therapist and work with my anxieties before I had to make a big decision like this, because it's very scary to me."
8725,I have a therapist at this point.
8726,Today after a grand total of three visits to a therapist I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.
8727,My therapist has given me options: medication or cognitive therapy.
8728,"At first I wanted to try both combined (medication and cognitive therapy) and would like to avoid benzodiazephies/benzos because of addictions in the family (specifically involving benzos) and I'd like something to be more long term and regular than a few weeks of medication and I have to go off of it (I like things to remain the same and be regular or else I begin to panic)

If anyone has had any experience with certain medications/therapies it would be awesome to have some opinions or suggestions."
8729,My therapist is also going to mail me information on cognitive therapy before my next appointment.
8730,I had a therapy appointment for yesterday morning at like 10am.
8731,"She called me back and said ""I don't think this therapy is for you."
8732,I've been even more anxious than I was before I skipped therapy.
8733,My therapist told me to call her if I was willing to take it seriously and I just feel so embarrassed by the way she spoke to me in the message that I cannot even bare myself to call her back and apologize for canceling.
8734,I have been in therapy off and on for two years and on celexa and propranolol for about the same duration.
8735,"Some background: I've had a history of mild depression and self esteem issues, I went to therapy for about 6 months and am doing much better for the most part now."
8736,Is therapist just another word for a psychologist?
8737,My mother convinced me to go see a therapist to help me through this.
8738,The therapist discussed anxiety disorders with me and we spent a lot of time talking about my fears and how a lot of them were unwarranted but brought on by an over reactive nervous system.
8739,The therapist showed me a lot of techniques to deal with anxiety and there is one that I still use to this day whenever I began to feel stressed.
8740,"At the time I didn’t feel like the therapy did much for me, so I began to work on recovering from this anxiety from within."
8741,"I still actively deal with my issues daily but I have recently (last couple years) recovered from ""suffering"" under them and regained control of my life through study and personal behavioral therapy."
8742,"I've been on plenty of meds, been to see cognitive therapists, counsellors and had visits with my doctor weekly."
8743,"I've been to therapy and dealt with most of the issues that came from this, but I never got good at handling conflict."
8744,"I'm already on Remeron (an SNRI), and I see a therapist regularly."
8745,My friend told me a while ago that she felt better after going to therapy.
8746,"Awhile ago, my therapist told me that there's no sense in worrying about something that hasn't happened yet, because it's all just made up."
8747,It really just proved that my therapist was right - worrying about the future is pointless.
8748,"She recommended some therapist I could try, and I did try calling some (any that did call me back told me they weren't seeing new patients right now)."
8749,"I know you guys aren't therapist, but if someone could just point me in the right direction it'd be appreciate it."
8750,"He was asking about how my therapy was going, when was I going to see a shrink, and how I was handling things."
8751,"I break down sobbing that my therapist is telling me that I need to quit my job, my family is telling me to quit my job, and that I don't think I can  ever actually get to normal as long as I am working here."
8752,I want to see a therapist or whatever but I have severe phone anxiety and I can't find any other ways to get ahold of someone without using the phone.
8753,I have therapy in a week with a new therapist but in the meantime it certainly wouldn't hurt to be proactive on my own.
8754,"Isolated for so long, so finally, after meditation, eating right, therapy, gym sleepless nights, every avenue exhausted I fell under that giant wheel of endless exhaustion and anxiety."
8755,"So I want to go start seeing a therapist next week, because of my not so mild anxiety and depression."
8756,"Yet somehow I have to walk into a strange place full of strange people none of which I know and all of which know that I'm there to see a therapist and judge me accordingly and tell that person that I have been depressed for years, lied to everyone I know for years to create a house of cards that could come down around me any day, that I can't leave the house sober let alone go any place I haven't been to or talk to anyone I don't already know and can't even answer the fucking phone, because if I don't I will inevitably end up killing myself."
8757,"I am going to see a therapist, but  not earlier than two weeks or so, and I would really appreciate some help."
8758,I'm also re-starting CBT so the medicine would be in conjunction with therapy.
8759,"I also am developing an obsession with checking my heart rate :-/

I've been seeing a therapist for 3 weeks thus far and I made an appointment with a cardiologist just to make myself feel better..."
8760,"Get issued a therapist, not a psychologist."
8761,"Had 6 sessions then she left the place (was an intern with a supervisor), eventually get moved to somebody else, have 5 or so sessions then said person left to start a family therapy private practice with little to no progress as when things seemed to gain traction, I get dropped."
8762,Both therapists I've had from the mental health institution say I should get tested but it's costly.
8763,"I got transferred to a new therapist through the institute, not a psychologist most likely."
8764,Should I just jump the gun and go for a psychologist now and not return the call for the therapist?
8765,"My favorites are NLP (neuro linguistic programming), time line therapy and EFT (emotional freedom technique - that tapping thing)."
8766,I had my first appointment with a therapist last week and it made me feel a little bit better but..
8767,"Do I see a therapist, try to handle it on my own with exercise and a healthy diet or maybe meds again...idk 

Please give me your advice."
8768,then i decided i was on a roll and started looking up therapists in my area.
8769,but the whole thought of interacting closely with a doctor or therapist made me so anxious that even the phone made me nervous.
8770,There are many things that do help with my anxiety I've found (and that's for another thread) but one of the MOST effective therapies that I just felt like I had to share with the community is REGGAE THERAPY.
8771,Talk therapy isn't really working.
8772,"Then I started seeing a new therapist who doesn't really use meds, and on his advice I switched from 300 mg XR to 100 mg normal Seroquel."
8773,"My therapist doesn't believe my panic attacks are being caused by medications or lack thereof, but nor does he have any suggestions for coping."
8774,"I might be going to a therapist soon, my mother suggested it but she is strongly apprehensive and scared of medication or drugs so I think I'll have to bring it up again when I get back home."
8775,I brought documentation to my employer from my therapist stating that I was being treated for an anxiety disorder.
8776,The reason why it might be so bad right now is because I havent taken any meds for almost 6 months and I was seeing a therapist.
8777,He finally convinced me that it's time to start therapy again.
8778,"I tried seeing a therapist while I was in college from the student health center, but it really didn't work out well at all."
8779,"I've been in therapy for about the same length of time trying to figure out how to get my life back in order, but it seems like I've made almost no progress in the matter."
8780,"- He hasn't worked for 6 years (lived with an ex - she's 40 years old and a therapist... and wanted to have children with him) for 5 years for free and claimed the situation worked for them both as she enjoyed his company and that he gave her $1000s over the years.... but nowhere near enough to cover his share of the rent)
- He is excessively frugal and refuses to take me out on dates to restaurants as he 'doesn't get much out of food'."
8781,"* Similarly, after I realised my problem was anxiety and I started therapy - I took the chance to start telling everybody I know (and even people that I do not know very well) what I am struggling with and what it means to me."
8782,"Things are really tough, my parents have taken him to many different therapists, he's tried hypnosis, meditation, medication, CBT not a lot seems to be changing..."
8783,"I already have a therapist but they don't help at all, were looking into getting a new one but i have to be in school to do that for some reason."
8784,"&amp;nbsp;

I begun to visit a therapist regularly, she prescribed me some medicines(citalopram 20mg, risperdal .5mg) taken in tandem worked well for awhile."
8785,"&amp;nbsp;

I have scheduled an appointment with my therapist who prescribes my medicine, I am wanting to try something else, with less effects on the heart and maybe less of zombie feeling."
8786,I told my therapist yesterday that I was fine with a 2 week gap in therapy.
8787,I've been trying to get an appointment with a therapist and psychiatrist - but it's hard to get an appointment with any that seem halfway decent.
8788,So this is my first time in therapy.. i will be attending my 3rd appointment next week and so far it just doesnt feel beneficial.
8789,"I want to go to my next appointment, because i feel like by than ill be able to rule out if its just because i dont click with the therapist."
8790,"Anyways, i guess i was just wondering what all of your experiences in therapy was like."
8791,He has been seeing a therapist for about a year now.
8792,I have gone to the therapist with him to find ways to communicate and techniques.
8793,"These techniques will help when we are in therapy but the second we leave, he feels like he can't handle the situations."
8794,How was your first appointment  with the therapist/psychologist  like?
8795,"I was prescribed Coaxil to help out with my Anxiety, but I have not bought it yet, I want to wait out a bit and go to therapy instead."
8796,"I have been to therapy through my school (so they can't actually prescribe drugs), but the techniques taught to me are often ineffective or impractical."
8797,I'm currently in therapy and will bring this up at the next session but I just needed to say this.
8798,"So, my therapist has been trying to help, suggesting ideas to maybe get back into the world."
8799,"For those who've gone through extensive therapy, how long into you noticed a change?"
8800,None of the above combinations worked well enough to get me out of the house long enough to do any kind of non-drug therapy.
8801,"To make this a long story short, I need to find a therapist."
8802,"I don't want a Christian counselor, because a lot of things I would like to talk about in therapy (my bisexuality, a pregnancy scare I had with my SO that I'm not married to yet)  I'd be too afraid to mention it to a Christian counselor."
8803,"But my parents are essentially paying for my therapy, minus a copay."
8804,How do I find a therapist/counseloe/etc that I am comfortable with while still having my parents be comfortable paying for it?
8805,"Also, how does one find a therapist..... My first therapist that I mentioned is also my mom's...."
8806,"I'm currently seeing a CBT therapist and am aware of my distorted thinking patterns, I'm also aware of my self-esteem I'm needing to boost."
8807,I told past therapists about the first incident.
8808,"7 years ago I started going to therapy after I dropped out of college, and one of the most important people in my life died."
8809,Tomorrow morning (in 8 hours) I'll call my therapist to get his opinion and then call the psychiatrist to get an appointment.
8810,"Tell her what your therapist told you, please.."
8811,I've tried years and years of therapy which helped a little but not enough to continue my huge copay.
8812,"I've thought about a speech therapist, but I am not sure."
8813,"Despite therapy and three types of medication (Cipralex, Buspirone, Quetiapine) I still have my ""off"" days."
8814,Medication and therapy not working.
8815,"And I'm expected to see a therapist and take meds, even though neither of my parents are willing to do either of those things themselves."
8816,I would go to my parents or maybe therapist but I'm so worried of their reaction.
8817,"Though i've been to my Doctors several times about this, all she's ever done is referred me to therapy."
8818,"Which did help, but i finished therapy roughly 2 months ago now."
8819,"I'd rather be on meds and go to therapy at the same time, but I need meds asap."
8820,I had been going to therapy for about a year (but I stopped because I didn't like opening up to my therapist) and taking Prozac.
8821,I'm seeing a therapist to try and find some coping mechanisms.
8822,**: I've seen a couple of counselors/therapists in previous years.
8823,My therapist recommended it and I'm not sure how I feel about it.
8824,I have done many kinds of therapy including alternative stuff in desperation.
8825,For the past few months I have been doing EMDR therapy.
8826,My therapist had given me the choice of working on that first remembed freakout or the worst trauma and I chose the earliest target.
8827,"and I am happy to find trying to find the words now to describe it is making me feel some of that peace again right now :)

My therapist uses the clickers with me and asked if I would like to use them to help reinforce this experience to which I agreed."
8828,I don't feel like therapy is beneficial because honestly there isn't really that much to talk about.
8829,I don't really know what is going on and I can't afford therapy.
8830,"I've gone through this for 8 years, with 2 hospitalizations, 5 therapists over 6 years, and 4 years on medication."
8831,"I stopped medication and therapy right before turning 18, and arguably I was good for about 6 months, but then everything just started coming back and much worse than before."
8832,I have been on the drug as part of a combined therapy/medication treatment for GAD and side effects of the drug have steadily gotten worse the longer I was on it.
8833,"(which I've been wanting to do, but I was too afraid to go to the gym)  I also think therapy would be something I'd like to try, but I don't have insurance and it ca be pretty pricy /: so we'll see."
8834,I'm going to a therapist.
8835,"I used to go to therapy, but she never remembered me so we'd always start over."
8836,"I'm just tired of no medications working, no therapists doing their jobs, and nothing going the way it should."
8837,In the beginning of our relationship we established that I had a problem that I had never acknowledged and after months and months I saw a therapist that I could BARELY afford and finally after going to the doctor was diagnosed with severe anxiety.
8838,"And woo I'm back on the exercising train but all that is is an hour or two when I don't think about how freakish and distorted my fucking body is, and yeah I used to be 155 pounds of lean muscle but I still dressed like shit then and I still was some weird ass twisted distorted circus sideshow, I'm just skinny now and can't figure out how to gain god damn weight because food is hard and christ I can't believe I'm doing this instead of anything else I'm supposed to be fucking wealthy or touring or changing the god damn world not sitting on a stupid as six figure salary that everyones SO GOD DAMN IMPRESSED by that they refuse to accept that it doesn't matter because if I'm not changing the world by 25 I'm going to be literally fucking dead

holy shit why are there no therapists without month long goddamn waitlists"
8839,"My therapist suspect aspergers is the biggest cause, but I got traits for many other disorders he mentioned."
8840,"I don't want to be reliant on habit-forming drugs, would I need to pay for therapy if I needed it?"
8841,"I started doing what I used to do while getting through my earlier therapy and began reassuring myself, eg that it's not my fault, I'm not a bad person, I didn't fuck things up with the girl, etc, and it began to alleviate it for a couple weeks."
8842,I haven't even gone this in to depth with my former therapist because of some mental block behind it but I woke up this morning feeling as if maybe I just need to hear someone elses opinion on this whole thing.
8843,"I have tried so many meds, different types of therapy and so much shit but I just cant to get past this stage."
8844,I started seeing a therapist and I need to write down my worries and compartmentalise them for our next appointment.
8845,"The scene from I Love Lucy in the chocolate packing plant maybe :) 

I don't really know if it's right for me, and I kind of feel like I'm wasting her (therapist's) time."
8846,I've been in therapy the last 2 years.
8847,"This comes on top of me deciding to find some new hobbies to engage myself with, to go back to therapy to work on my coping skills, and to find a psychiatrist to see if I can get back on Celexa to help with my improvement."
8848,"I can't afford to see a therapist, I'm recently unemployed and uninsured."
8849,Did your doctor/therapist suggest it or did you bring it up?
8850,"the idea of therapy horrifies me, posting here, and just talking about my anxiety to anyone but my boyfriend I guess is a first step for me to hopefully one day work up the nerve to get help."
8851,We talked about it and I have decided I want to see a therapist.
8852,So I have found a therapy clinic with multiple doctors.
8853,What is the average cost for a therapy session at a university clinic?
8854,"(USA)

Does therapy actually help?"
8855,"I'm fighting back anxiety attacks and just started therapy (next appointment is next Tuesday) - but in the mean time I'm afraid it's going to cost me everything - My family, my SO of 9 months, my friends, my university course."
8856,"Will be talking to my therapist about this next week, but would like to know if someone has any strategies they can recommend?"
8857,Should I see a therapist about this?
8858,I've also been going to therapy and focused on my breathing which helped too.
8859,"I am not an MD, or a therapist, but I have sensed something was not quite right since early on."
8860,I'm looking for a therapist and I'm trying to get around it myself but I'm stuck right now and it's killing me.
8861,"I like exposure therapy, but absolutely hate it when I start smiling/I can't control the smiling lips."
8862,I decided to give some of the tactics my therapist explained to me a shot.
8863,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
8864,"Seeing a therapist, deep breathing, meditation, physical activities, hobbies, etc."
8865,"I was getting frustrated with her because she was not doing what I needed her to do, which was basically be a therapist."
8866,(I am 18 now) I am finally getting some professional therapy.
8867,"Anyway,  no longer on the spot, I feel like maybe I'd like to seek some sort of therapy."
8868,"I know that they'll know and the therapy would be under their insurance, but I'd just rather them think it's all just stress from school."
8869,Is there anything I can do to fix this besides resorting to therapy or medication?
8870,They told me maybe I should put [this]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1voofr/i_am_a_therapist_who_struggled_with_anxiety/) here.
8871,I go to therapy and I'm thinking about going on medication but it scares me.
8872,4 days ago a good friend of mine took me to see a guy who make magnetic therapy.
8873,I have experienced trauma and my therapist once mentioned possible mild ptsd (my father would abuse me as a child).
8874,"I'm 27 years old, a male and my therapist has not specified what *sort* of Anxiety I suffer from, but has referred to GAD most often."
8875,I'm scared that if I tell my doctor he will take me off completely and send me to therapy.
8876,I've been starting therapy too so I can focus on not letting it become my future but right now I still feel so scared and unhappy I've been alone for so long.
8877,"When I go to my therapist and our goal is to ""reduce my symptoms""."
8878,"*

&gt; *This does not, of course, replace therapy or any therapeutic activities prescribed or recommended by a professional."
8879,"I was in therapy for a while, but my insurance doesn't cover it anymore, and being a recent college graduate, I can't afford the cost myself."
8880,"I think this post is going to end up as mostly a huge wall of venting, but despite taking medication (Celexa) and seeing a therapist once a week, my anxiety has continued to go through the roof over Winter Break."
8881,"I don't see my therapist for two more weeks since I'm on Winter Break, but even then, I don't find her very helpful as she's focused on my social anxiety, which is practically nonexistent compared to this situational anxiety."
8882,"Middle School : panic attacks, out patient treatment, begin therapy and meds."
8883,"I've been in psychotherapy for 5 years now and I tried out different medication (Paxil, Prozac; but also Valium and Xanax and even got dependent on it and had to do a very unpleasant withdrawal) but none of it helped me to beat this tormenting disorder."
8884,"I plan on seeing my therapist this week, but I am very interested in learning of others' experiences to know that I'm not alone."
8885,"I have done psychotherapy for four years, and also use an SSRI; this tip is more of a complement to those things, not really a stand-alone solution."
8886,"My parents say I can go back to therapist, but at 150 a week with insurance only paying 25$ it is super expensive for us."
8887,"I have plans to make an appointment with my therapist, but once I do, the appointment is usually not for a few weeks."
8888,"Going for xrays, got medicine and referral for physical therapy."
8889,"I’ve gone to counseling and tried EMDR, talk therapy worked with psychiatrist and psychologist."
8890,So I started seeing a therapist and have begun to feel better.
8891,But during one of my last therapy appointments my therapist said something incredibly useful; she said to structure my breathing like a sigh of relief.
8892,I have an appt with a new therapist this week and am looking forward to really working at my anxiety.
8893,Maybe because I'm used to having it in my system (which I'm going to bring up to my therapist- I don't always want to be reliant on it) or because just having it makes me feel safe.
8894,"I'm in therapy but if anyone knows good mental exercises for working on this, shoot 'em my way."
8895,"It was causing me constant and immense stress, and my husband and therapist both agreed that it was making my anxiety/depression worse."
8896,I went to therapists several times when I was a child and always seemed to come out okay.
8897,I'm anxious and take Zoloft and occasionally see a therapist.
8898,"my question to you all is first, does this ever happen to you (waking up suddenly in the middle of an epic panic attack,) and if so...since i've already spoken to my primary doctor and i'm on medication (clearly not working effectively), and each time i try to make an appointment for CBT/therapy there is a huge wait for new patients."
8899,"i know a hospital would if it was for something they could medicate, but not so sure about a therapist."
8900,"Flowy is not meant to be used as a quick fix, or a replacement to traditional psychological therapies; rather, it is a complementary tool for you to use at your convenience and aims to fit seamlessly into how you manage your health."
8901,"But my GP wants me to go ""see a therapist."""
8902,I truly do not believe I have any need for a therapist.
8903,"I know a lot of people benefit from therapy, but I feel like I'd have nothing to talk about other than what I had for dinner last night and how much laundry I need to do this weekend."
8904,My therapist agreed this was a good idea and told me there is usually a difference between brand-name and generic.
8905,I recently started going to therapy again and my therapist recommended that I get back on Paxil (I used to have a prescription but always forgot to take it so I gave up).
8906,I just want to vent against doctors and therapists who are trying to 'teach' you how to get 'rid' of anxiety.
8907,"Yes, dear therapists, we do sometimes have periods of calm."
8908,"I'm in therapy, but I can't see her every week and she's pretty  new to this so I'm not sure she can help me."
8909,"My therapist feels the gf and the issues her family have with me contribute to my anxiety, as in their eyes I can't do anything right."
8910,When I was in high school I had anger management problems and was sent to therapy by my parents.
8911,Some odd years later and I am still in therapy.
8912,My therapist and I have a very close relationship and I can talk to him about anything and he will give me a straight up answer whether I like it or not.
8913,I actually was thinking about taking a break from therapy for the summer since nothing was getting better or worse.
8914,But then this month my therapist moved to a new office in a huge business area (his old office was in a little hick town).
8915,Do I speak to my GP or do I See a therapist directly?
8916,How do I know which therapist to go see?
8917,"I went to therapy, using Xanax as necessary (very sparingly, 30 .25mg pills would last me a solid year)."
8918,"Anyone know of any therapies, medications, and/or strategies that could help me and others like me."
8919,I have a variety of recent events I'm working through and I need to do some self-talk therapy.
8920,"Well I had been seeing my old therapist from September 2013 up until July, when I had to switch to a new therapist for insurance reasons."
8921,My old therapist was the first therapist I ever saw.
8922,"I have nothing against the new therapist, and in fact I think he has been quite insightful and has helped me see things from a different perspective so far."
8923,But I guess I miss the comfort I had developed with my old therapist over the 9 or so months I had seen him.
8924,"I recall even when I first starting seeing the old therapist, I was questioning myself whether he was really a good fit or not or if this was helping at all for like the first 2 or 3 months."
8925,"I think I'm just going through that again with the new therapist, but I've definitely been feeling anxious about it."
8926,"*"" I'm seeing two therapists one for depression and one for CBT for anxiety, both said that a job would be good for me."
8927,"The band worked with sound therapists to get advice on how to make the most effective use of harmonies, rhythms and bass lines."
8928,I might seek therapy soon if I can't figure out why I get these terrible moods.
8929,"So, anyone currently in therapy for anxiety, have you used this and did it work at all?"
8930,"I've been to a therapist when I was younger and it was a bad experience, I did not like it."
8931,"I had drs appointments for therapy each wednesday but didnt say why, they made it so fucking hard to get my shifts changed for them."
8932,I'd call my therapist but she had to take some time off to deal with a family emergency and her receptionist said they will call me when she's ready to see people again.
8933,"As for seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist, I won't be able to until January when my insurance kicks in."
8934,"I think the only person who really knows how bad it is, besides therapists and doctors that I've seen, is my advisor."
8935,"I've encouraged her to start therapy, but she hasn't."
8936,"I'm in therapy myself, and I talk about this a lot in my sessions, but I still get anxious every day worrying about her."
8937,My therapist says I just need to tolerate it until it's over but it just is getting worse.
8938,I think a lot about becoming a therapist or counselor of some fashion.
8939,"A pool to float and relax on, massage therapists, and therapists on hand."
8940,I met with my therapist today after a disappointingly anxious week.
8941,My therapist suggested coming up with a mantra/phrase to say when I begin feeling this way.
8942,"* taken medication in the past, didn't help, doing group therapy now

So I finally landed a job I think I MIGHT be able to hold down for more than a few days."
8943,"I'm completely fine now, but still, I can't help but feel uncomfortable at the prospect of a therapy revolving around something I feared for years;
* She insisted on the therapy without even asking if I've experienced traumatic events;
* I'm not sure if EMDR is even a decent therapy for the people who have PTSD (there seems to be some controversy over its effectiveness);
* She was unwilling to tell me the type of therapy we'd be doing or to take my concerns about it seriously."
8944,"I feel like it's inappropriate for my situation and an overreaction, like giving chemotherapy to someone with the flu."
8945,"However, I also feel like I can't just walk away because perhaps EMDR is actually a decent therapy, and perhaps I'll benefit from it despite my reservations."
8946,"I've been in the middle of a move lately and in the midst of a sea of chaos, I accidentally scheduled two things at the same time earlier today; an appointment with my therapist, and my tutoring job."
8947,I've had therapy which didn't seem to help but I've never been on any drugs.
8948,"First and foremost, I've been seeing a therapist for the past 5 months with great success, and I've begun a regular exercise program, which has helped a lot on top of the meds and therapy."
8949,"I'm also in a much better situation now than i was when i started therapy (I now have a more rewarding job much closer to home whereas before I had an excruciating commute to a thankless job that just killed me inside)

Secondly, Cymbalta started off fantastic, but now is giving me some side effects that are starting to become unbearable."
8950,"I think I'm well enough with my therapy and exercise to talk to my doctor about cycling off my meds, at least so I can enjoy my anniversary in the middle of March."
8951,"I've been going to talk therapy for my anxiety, for about 7 months now."
8952,"My feelings around my mother have not been great for a while, and that's one of the primary reasons why I started therapy."
8953,But I feel like therapy only made it worse.
8954,I don't talk to anyone about it except my therapist.
8955,"I'm currently seeing a therapist for my anxiety (3 whole appointments now), and I am on an antidepressant and 15mg buspirone."
8956,"(Plus a handful, no literally, they fill my hand, of other various meds....)

Anyways, finally last week, a combination of hormonal craziness, therapy cutting deeply (yay tears!"
8957,I have therapy.
8958,Last few times I couldn't even get to my therapist.
8959,I'm an artist currently working on an installation piece that explores therapy techniques for social anxiety disorders; specifically 'spatial' fears such as agoraphobia and claustrophobia.
8960,I am particularly interested in in vivo exposure therapy techniques and looking for people to share their experiences in the form of audio interviews.
8961,"I was distracting myself by watching my favorite Korean shows, playing the piano, school, going places, therapy, etc."
8962,"Also, I have no money, so I cant go to a doctor/therapist, and trying to get through this myself just isnt working."
8963,She had gone to a few sessions and it gave her a breakthrough while trying to figure out mom issues in therapy.
8964,"I continued doing everything tho: NF, Ativan, Lexapro, mindful meditating, exercising and talking to my therapist once a week."
8965,I still take the Lexapro and see my therapist once a month.
8966,My therapist has been a great help in advising me on what my life is missing.
8967,"[9/9, 5:54 PM] Sophie: right .. [9/9, 5:54 PM] Joe: Parents and therapist think it's good course of action to take away my electronics and turn off phone and shit... [9/9, 5:55 PM] Joe: Why?!"
8968,"[9/9, 6:00 PM] Sophie: how is she therapist [9/9, 6:01 PM] Joe: Let me just shove some more antidepressants with 10 pages of side-effects down your throat when scientists still don't understand how Depression, Anxiety, and Anti-depressants work completely."
8969,"Hi, I'm female, 21, and I have a therapist and a psychiatrist to handle my panic attacks, general anxiety, and mild depression."
8970,"After that, I started working in my father's business, but he's now on partial retirement and the amount of work I do is basically enough to cover room, food, therapy, and the minimum payment on my student loans."
8971,"My therapist has me taking baby steps like getting out and trying to meet people, but my feelings of shame are every bit as strong as my anxieties, and all of these assignments leave me feeling disappointed."
8972,"In recent years I have been able to function OK without meds or weekly therapy, while in college."
8973,"I go to therapy, however I just started and no, I'm not on any medications."
8974,I'm thinking of calling my therapist at home for permission to up my meds.
8975,"I'd much prefer he see a specialist and go through cognitive behavioural therapy, but he wants to avoid seeing anyone as when I convinced him to earlier, they told him that as a lot of his triggers to his panic attacks relate to me, we should take a break, and he's adamant that he doesn't want to leave me."
8976,"Things have gotten tough and through seeing a short-term psychologist, group therapy, and trying different medications (benzodiazepines work best for me), I have finally become able to control the monstrous state of panic that I used to let control my life."
8977,I understand that a psychiatrist is a medical doctor and would probably prescribe some medication while a psychologist would probably help me through therapy.
8978,"Are psychiatrist good at therapy, or they just prescribe medication according to your symptoms?"
8979,"I really don't want to start with one therapist and have to change and reexplain all my feelings to someone else, so i really want to get it right the first time."
8980,"Now this does sound crazy, I know, my therapist and my doctors have all assured me I am not schizophrenic or anything but this is a big one for me."
8981,"She prescribed me 10mg of Prozac, and recommended I start seeing a therapist."
8982,"And for the therapy part, I've always been really bad at talking about myself/my issues with others."
8983,I don't know how I'd be able to get passed that if I did choose to begin seeing a therapist.
8984,"I have seen therapists, and a general hold on my issues with anxiety that I've chose to live medication free."
8985,My therapist agrees.
8986,"i have tried to see a therapist a few times, but every time i either really hated the therapist or kept forgetting to go to the appointments or sometimes just didn't feel like i was ""depressed"" enough to go after a month or so so i stopped going."
8987,"i really want to get professional help but i don't really know how to go about finding a therapist that i wouldn't hate, which is an exhausting task in itself that i don't really have time for with all of the other responsibilities that i have (not that i'm keeping up with them anyway)."
8988,i know i need a therapist but finding one has been tough to bring myself to do.
8989,"I'm not comfortable talking about these things with my parents, and something tells me they would frown upon the idea of seeing a therapist to help me try to sort this out."
8990,"So, after way too long of needing a therapist, I finally convinced myself to schedule a meeting for today."
8991,"I almost walked out when it wouldn't let me continue without clicking yes, just would have walked back to my dorm and just not done therapy again."
8992,"I've tried some non-medicated solutions (meditative breaths, calming music, aromatherapy, got flux for my computer, even prayed) but they aren't very effective in extreme cases--like tonight."
8993,"Since we've been together, she recently lapsed into a big ""rut""
We've been going to therapy, she's on medication (for the first time ever) she's been officially diagnosed with Major Depression and Anxiety Disorder, but things have been getting better than they were right before we decided to go get help."
8994,"The problem is I live in a country where therapy is generally seen as something strage/crazy/stupid, something not socially acceptable."
8995,"I have found a  bunch of clinics and individual therapists, but I don't know ANYTHING about them."
8996,I don't even know how clinic/therapy works.
8997,I grown up in a disfunctional family - I think that therapy that can deal with that may be a good idea.
8998,If you have a therapist how did you found him/her?
8999,"**Some background:** Many years on different medications, with different forms of therapy of varying effectiveness."
9000,"I am extremely curious as to whether or not it is possible, through some form of therapy or mindset or what have you, to accomplish this goal and am optimistic for further progress."
9001,"I went to therapy for my anxiety and crisis counseling after my mom passed away in february, but I didn't like the CBT they were doing so I stopped showing up after 3 appointments."
9002,"I am seeing a therapist, but I can't be with her all the time obviously and some of this stuff is difficult."
9003,Everytime I go to a therapist they have the talk about what they can and can't keep confidential.
9004,"http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1zlka2/im_finally_getting_treatment_but_im_distressed/

So I ended up choosing the 1 on 2 therapy (me, therapist and trainee) over the group therapy."
9005,(Only because it starts sooner) I told the therapist that I'm merely trying it out and if it doesn't work out I wish to be in the therapy group in May.
9006,My first session with the therapist and trainee starts tomorrow at 4pm.
9007,Do therapists question you about your current habits/coping methods?
9008,Maybe it'd be different if I was dealing with just a therapist and myself.
9009,I started seeing a therapist who helped me understand I have PTSD and taught me coping mechanisms for the anxiety.
9010,I think I am going to see a therapist to help build good coping mechanisms in case the anxiety hits again.
9011,"In that time I have become very suicidal, I have checked myself into a hospital, I have spent sometime in a day / in-patient program, and I have seen my therapist and gotten medication."
9012,Don't want to go back to therapy.
9013,I saw a therapist a few years back and it was helpful in as far as organising a CBT methodology and a bit of the Freudian(?)
9014,"I have previously been opposed to medication, I guess I felt like I was strong enough to sort it out through other means, but I do not want to go to a talk therapist again."
9015,"Hi... :)

I have been seeing a CBT therapist for a while about anxiety for the last few months but it didn't work out very well and I have recently stopped seeing her."
9016,"I'm really interested in seeing a doctor though about getting a formal diagnosis and seeking further treatment (I want to try medication, though I guess I'm still open minded about therapy... maybe)."
9017,"I'd rather try medication for a bit now, as I had a bit of a bad experience with therapy."
9018,"Also I wasn't really crazy about CBT therapy to be honest, but would I be able to specify that I want to try other types?"
9019,"Keep looking at this sub, getting therapy, talking to others, reading self help books, and/or logically acknowledging you suffer from an obnoxious mental illness."
9020,I just got back from the therapist and as it made me feel better it also made me think.
9021,My therapist reccommened outpatient treatment.
9022,"I was diagnosed with ADHD a few years ago and although medication and therapy helped a little bit, I still found myself struggling A LOT."
9023,"I started CBT at the time, but therapy for my test anxiety almost instantly took a back seat when my therapist realized I had a great deal of other psychological issues that were more pressing and needed immediate attention."
9024,"I'm planning to start cognitive behavioral therapy very soon, but I'm wondering if there are any other resources that helped you."
9025,This summer I've tried contacting a therapist for some professional assistance.
9026,"I seriously think I need to talk to a professional outside of my personal life, but the idea of talking to just any random therapist scares the shit outta me."
9027,"She has been seeing a psychologist and a therapist, and recently spent a night inpatient because of the self-harm ideas."
9028,"be talking to her Psych/therapist tomorrow, and asking the questions about a return to in-patient treatment."
9029,"I made contact with a therapist prior to the nightmare/start of the thoughts and should get to see one within a few weeks, but I'm really struggling and kinda scared to talk to them about something I consider really serious."
9030,"I didn't tell anyone about my anxiety until around the time I left school and since then i've tried medication and therapy, neither of which have made any difference."
9031,"I feel so weak for not being able to confront my fears as I was advised to do in therapy sessions, I don't know where to start and at this rate I feel like it's never going to end, I'll be a prisoner in my head forever."
9032,"TL;DR Points:

* Husband is dealing with anxiety/depression 
* Current meds: Viibryd, Adderall, &amp; Lorazepam 
* On intermittently leave (FMLA) from work but hasn’t been back in almost a full month due to him not being able to deal with negative co-workers (I think it may be something more but he doesn’t want to talk about it) *Our funds are running dry 
* Can't afford a therapist 
* What else can I do to remain supportive and help him go back to work/make a new move job-wise?"
9033,"He wants to meet with a therapist but we lack the funds and have no idea where to find a good therapist in our area (we previously found someone affordable, but her tactic was for him to purchase a 'self-help' book, see 3 other doctors, and meet with her weekly which she kept reminding him he can't afford)."
9034,"Also, I'm not sure how much I need actually therapy."
9035,"Yes, I was diagnosed by a professional, and I have been seeing a variety of different therapists over the course of 10 years, taking medication, etc."
9036,"I've talked about it with a therapist, but it hasn't really been helping, and I just wanted to get some general advice before I think about switching therapists again, since doing so is exhausting."
9037,To add on I will be joining a group therapy next month.
9038,"I've been considering therapy, but I'm very low income, a student, a single mom, and the local low income mental health system is pretty crap."
9039,"I'm on prozac for social anixety, one of my roommates is taking like 4 different medications for anxiety, ocd, a sleeping disorder, and panic attacks, and the other two have never been to therapy or anything before but they clearly have a great deal of anxiety."
9040,I talked to my therapist about all of this and he said that I can't let the anxiety of everyone else effect me so much but how the fuck am I supposed to do that?
9041,I've been to see multiple therapists and have been on a couple prescription drugs.
9042,I know a licensed therapist I've already considered going back to.
9043,"I don't doubt I'd be able to get the information, but I don't really have ""a while"" and it's 2AM on sunday night so I need to know if I should get started tomorrow (by the way, calling the therapist/office of disabilities?"
9044,I've been in therapy for over a year.
9045,My sons meeting at his school with his therapists.
9046,I don't know much about anxiety and anxiety breakdowns but I know she a) takes meds and b) went to a therapist.
9047,"I see a therapist weekly for depression and anxiety, but now she has given up on treating my anxiety with therapy and she thinks I should try another med."
9048,"PS : sorry for my shitty english... not my first language, like lots of people here :)

PPS : I'm having therapy for some time too, but this specific problem isn't finding any solution there."
9049,"So i guess i'm putting this out there cos i just want to show that things can change, August 17th this year marked the 12 month Anniversary of me going to my pre-therapy assessment 

This September will mark 12 months in Therapy its self, i wont lie it was the most difficult / painful thing i've ever done...but yet its also one of the best things that i've ever done."
9050,"I told him I wasn't ready for meds yet, and he was comfortable with that but still strongly encouraged a therapist."
9051,Is there like a website to read reviews on therapists?
9052,"I've had therapist after therapist and doc after doc EXPLAIN IN DETAIL WHY I FEEL THE WAY I DO, and how it is ANXIETY related."
9053,"After a year of therapy and Prozac, I consider myself mostly freed from anxiety in the sense that it doesn't prevent me from every day things."
9054,"She wanted to prescribe me SSRIs, however I have been on all of them on the market as well as counselling for roughly half my life with several different therapists (since my parents' divorce) and it did nothing for me but crush my GPA and trigger much more frequent and violent seizures."
9055,"I was late to my first therapy session yesterday, so I only just sat and talked with the guy and greeted him."
9056,I've been seeing a therapist for depression for the past few weeks and I'm starting to feel something else?
9057,"Hello,

Ive never been to a therapist or doctor about this so never been formally diagnosed with anxiety."
9058,"I am going on a bit but my main concern about anxiety therapy or medication is that I can't see it making the issues that I do stress about going away, they won't get resolved unless i act on them and as long as they are there I will always fret on them."
9059,"Which is something a normal, healthy person wouldn't feel embarrassed about… Which made me think that I should probably seek therapy."
9060,"Been in therapy for a straight year, 3+ years total in my life."
9061,"My therapist, bless her, keeps trying to ""train"" me to ""sit"" with the feeling but I literally feel like I'm going to explode sometimes."
9062,"I've seen therapists to talk about anxiety over the past two years but I've never told them what I'm worrying about and I'm not telling you guys because, to be honest, I'm utterly and completely ashamed of the subject of the worry (and also the worry itself is super paranoid/weird/stupid)."
9063,This is why I can't bring myself to go to a therapist.
9064,The medications I've suffered through and the therapists that have quit on me.
9065,"Everything had been going really well, I've started EMDR therapy and that's really helped with my anxiety."
9066,I have just moved to a new city and started therapy.
9067,"I'm on meds and in therapy, but my parents antagonize me for not trying hard enough to make my anxiety go away."
9068,"So I partly blame the Dr. 

3) Last time I was there and was very anxious she mentioned that I should see a therapist."
9069,"During that year, I started going to the university's therapist."
9070,"But that didn't help at all, so she sent me to the city's mental health institution (ggz) and I started therapy away from school, just before the summer holidays."
9071,"At the same time i started to see therapist, which was the best decision during my recovery, because for the very first time in my life i was able to express my deepest thoughts and fears and i started to unravel this huge engtanglement of thoughts i had made in my 24 years of life."
9072,"Before i started to see therapist i was scared about my life, i worried about my future and i tried to avoid any potential threats to myself."
9073,"For example, these thoughts include checking to see if my anxiety is still here (I also have depersonalization so that's another thing I usually check for), going over coping mechanisms I have learned, reviewing how my anxiety started/progressed, thinking about all the progress I have made so far, thinking about what I want to tell my therapist the next time I see her, and so on."
9074,"I attended therapy for almost a year, but I'm not at all good with therapists."
9075,I can't get back to therapy for a week.
9076,"More info on AWARE:  http://ukhypnosis.com/2010/01/09/being-aware-in-cognitive-therapy-for-anxiety/

Just by using this simple, yet effective technique, I was able to maintain myself in a situation today, where I have recently felt EXTREME anxiety."
9077,"I tried exposure therapy last year but had issues with insurance and paying for it and had to stop - it helped, but it came back once I stopped."
9078,I'm currently on the max dosage of Zoloft and in therapy.
9079,I've gone through therapy.
9080,I'm still in therapy.
9081,"My anxiety disorder has taken a turn for the worst and I cant afford meds or therapy, and the only anxiety books I have found have been too much I need simple quick and natural ways to help while experiencing a panic attack."
9082,I am really just coming to terms with the fact that I experience anxiety attacks and am trying to come up with good ways to deal with them until I can get in to see a therapist.
9083,I have seen a therapist and got to the point that I was dealing with it pretty well on my own using the tools she helped me with.
9084,"I felt I got to a point that I was able to do that and after I had really begun to be able to deal with it, I stopped therapy."
9085,I am not currently seeing a therapist or counselor.
9086,"I'm too afraid to talk to parents, (never been close), and I am also too poor to afford to drive or pay for a therapist, and my SO is the only one i can relate to... What can I do?"
9087,"**TL;DR** - very anxious after stopping physical abuse cold-turkey, too poor and embarrassed to go to doctor or therapist, what do I do?"
9088,I tried therapy.
9089,I don't believe therapy will help now.
9090,I can't imagine a therapist saying something to me I haven't heard a hundred times before.
9091,"I am currently seeing a therapist, however I've left out my drug use out of fear I'll shipped away to rehab or something."
9092,"I have a lot of faith in myself because I have managed my anxiety pretty well without the help of therapy or medication, but right now, since I am away from home, I could use a little help."
9093,Is this something I should go back to my therapist to discuss?
9094,I have a little anxiety and it's mostly social but we both decided it'd be best to go to therapy and I did.
9095,He doesn't know I've been to therapy.
9096,I did ~30 hours of group therapy a week for 1-2 months and then ~9 hours a week for another month.
9097,"I might have to apply for SS disability but that scares the hell out of me too and my psych and therapist probably won't like the idea because I'm only 33 and they keep telling me ""anxiety isn't forever!""."
9098,I have been in a ton of therapy.
9099,I've been in therapy with various people for 10 years with some brief gaps in there.
9100,My current therapist I've been seeing since October.
9101,I'm feeling though like I'm TOO comfortable in therapy.
9102,I can certainly make lists of how I feel at different times outside of therapy.
9103,I really like this therapist and don't want to switch but it feels like I'm not able to make any kind of forward progress because I am so disconnected from my daily experiences during that 50 minutes of therapy.
9104,My therapist is pretty young (only been licensed 2 years).
9105,"I don't want to hear ""this is just a phase"" from my parents and my therapist."
9106,I recently got tested for ADHD because my therapist recognized some signs in me and it came back positive for the inattentive type.
9107,"I would never have guessed ADHD being the root cause of most of my anxieties and I now having better control over my thoughts, I feel that I can actually implement the practices I've learned through the years of therapy now."
9108,"I've gone through hypnotherapy, which did help, but only to an extent."
9109,"Which brings me to the real purpose of the post: 
My therapist and I have determined my panic attacks have stages or levels."
9110,"I was diagnosed with GAD and clinical depression when I was 13, but my therapist did nothing but look at me when I talked to her so I don't know why my parents bothered with that at all."
9111,"I haven't really found any articles that are based around his problems, so this is kind of my last hope to try to encourage him to see a doctor and then hopefully a therapist afterwards."
9112,She sees a therapist but he's a psychoanalyst.
9113,She needs a behavioral therapist that discusses daily management of stress and coping strategies.
9114,"My therapist thinks I ""built"" this world of constant dullness because I used to spend most of my childhood / teenage years inside a bubble."
9115,"I have also been thinking that it would be nice to seek therapy, just someone to talk to for some perspective about these things that I think."
9116,She even thought I should seek out a therapist.
9117,"But anyway, how does one seek out a therapist for this sort of thing without  family members finding out?"
9118,"The Dr. used words like schizophrenia, bipolar or maybe just the drugs and recommended him to the therapist."
9119,I started seeing my therapist again.
9120,My therapist said it's just a form of anxiety but I'm terrified I'm going insane.
9121,"and luckily i have a dog that has a perfect temperament for it

i'm gonna bring it up with my therapist on thursday but just thought i'd see if anyone here has any input"
9122,"I've cut out the caffeine, the alcohol, eating healthier, drinking tea, meditating, exercising, even gone as far started seeing a therapist..."
9123,"Also, I don't go to therapy."
9124,I was getting better through therapy but then all of a sudden my heart rate starts hovering arojund 95+ for the past week then sometimes its up to 117 and right now its 107 and its been like this for the past two days.
9125,Should I get medication or see a therapist?
9126,Specifically testosterone replacement therapy.
9127,"I'm hoping I'll allow myself to bring this up at my next therapy appointment on Monday, but I don't know if I'm just overreacting."
9128,I'm having some problems with my psychologist/therapist.
9129,"Apparently my lab group and I have to write on our lab report on Tuesday, which means I can't make it to the therapy session."
9130,I had to double check that with my lab group and just got their reply and now it's too late to text my therapist (it's almost 9pm).
9131,Even though therapy isn't really working at all I need to go talk to someone each week (and preferably more than once a week).
9132,"I'm nervous and anxious about going into the therapists office, because I don't know what to expect."
9133,So I made an appointment with a therapist.
9134,"I've talked to several therapists about it, and according to them, it's a nature vs nurture kind of thing."
9135,"After a bit of delay I'm all set up with a talk therapist, and I've seen her 3 times now (again tomorrow)."
9136,Maybe the therapy sessions give me some sense of purpose and meaning for the day that I don't get otherwise.
9137,"Hey,
I've been to therapy since this spring, mostly for sleep issues, and while it has helped to some extent (I've started doing a lot more relaxation) I still have problems with other stuff."
9138,"I mostly feel like I just talk about my problems with my therapist, then he kind of just confirms everything or repeats it or says OK...It's nice to have someone to vent to but I've started reading a bit on my own about GAD and I've gotten surprisingly few tips on techniques I can use to manage my condition."
9139,I should probably seek out another therapist but I don't feel like starting over right now and I feel motivated enough to keep myself going.
9140,"**TL;DR: Been to therapy, hasn't helped as much as I'd liked, anyone got tips on resources (books, CBT techniques etc) I can use to help myself?"
9141,"I am waiting for my new insurance to kick in in March before I see a therapist, but I feel like I am losing my grip right now."
9142,I'm not on any meds and don't see a therapist.
9143,"The chemotherapy she received from that had given her a small chance to get leukemia, and it did."
9144,My therapist is also out of town for the next 3 weeks.
9145,"I'm 22 and I've been dealing with anxiety for quite some time now, however, I've only been seeing a therapist for six months."
9146,"2) Hence, medication without therapy will not provide help in every case, because pills will not change your character, they will not give you the tool for controlling your emotions."
9147,"I've tried medicine, therapy, nutrition, chiropractic care, journaling...."
9148,"I've been to therapy and they just try to say that something bad must have happened as a child, but nothing ever did."
9149,I'm only taking half for the first three days (as my doctor recommended) and then taking a full pill on the fourth day and continue taking the full pill until I see a psychiatrist/therapist that tells me what to do from there.
9150,I'm currently working through dealing with panic attacks with a therapist and I've found that my anxiety sort of flows and changes the more I work through it.
9151,"I see a therapist and she is talking about putting me on medication, we didn't talk the specifics but I mentioned it to my parents who are extremely anti medication and think I just need to find a way to ""deal with it"" like ""normal people"" do."
9152,My next therapy session can't get here fast enough.
9153,"I'm working with my therapist on not being bothered by my thoughts so much, and he brought up an interesting point."
9154,I’ve never seen a therapist or psychiatrist so anything that I think about my self is self-diagnosed.
9155,So I'd like to preface with whenever I'm not traveling for work I usually see a therapist about every other week for anxiety issues.
9156,I won't be home for months so I can't see my therapist.
9157,I have been in talk therapy for a while with moderate success but was recommended that I see a psychiatrist for further help.
9158,I'm planning on continuing therapy while on the medication and am hoping it will take the edge off of the obsessive thoughts so I can implement what I've learned cognitively into everyday function.
9159,"To those with ADD who have sought therapy, to what extent has it helped you with your ADD and anxiety in general?"
9160,I had talked through them in therapy; sedated them with drugs from the psychiatrist; pounded them into submission at Taekwondo; but never had I just looked at them.
9161,I took two days off of my other job to try and move (my lease ends tomorrow) and recover and I saw my psychatrist today and he set me up with someone to work on cognative therapy with.
9162,"But yeah, I'm going to therapy and my therapist recommended that I see a psychiatrist."
9163,While talking to my general MD he started pushing heavily to me getting not only back into therapy but also to get tested for schizophrenia.
9164,"I want to go back into therapy to get help with my depression and anxiety, I have never been able to hold down a job because of it and just normal life is so much harder than it should be; but I am afraid of getting the schizophrenia test."
9165,"As mentioned, I'm going to see a therapist."
9166,I just had an appointment with my therapist today and now made an appointment with a psychiatrist.
9167,The therapist has helped some but I'm just a big mess now.
9168,"I have a therapist that I have been seeing who is close to my home, but she isn't a doctor and cannot prescribe medication."
9169,"If I need long-term treatment or therapy, I will need a means of paying for it due to my health insurance cutting off in a few months."
9170,I have the option to get an Rx for it since I've tried tons of other drugs and therapy.
9171,The biggest problem is that my counsellor wants me to try exposure therapy and write down what exact thoughts I have when I'm getting anxious.
9172,"I have tried therapy, meditation, and herbal supplements, as well as trying to talk myself into being calm and self-affirmation type stuff."
9173,"I am thinking that I might need to go on medication, since therapy alone isn't helping."
9174,I notice I still lie more then I should to my therapist.
9175,I should note that I also trust my therapist %100
9176,"I decided that instead of going back to the urgent care doctor, because Anxiety isn't quite what they're supposed to specialize in, I would make an appointment with my primary care doctor, and see if she would recommend I go see a therapist, or what."
9177,"Should I go ahead and make an appointment with a therapist, or wait until after I see my primary care doctor?"
9178,What do I do until I can see my primary care doctor and/or therapist?
9179,I'm seeing a therapist and have alprazolam (sorry if misspelled) and taking a very small dose of viibryd for depression as well.
9180,"It sounds silly to complain about, but I started taking an antidepressant and seeing a therapist several months ago, and things are improving."
9181,"I saw a therapist twice and she basically told me to stop thinking so much and to take ""small risks"" but I can't even muster up the courage to do that half the time."
9182,I really don't want to go to therapy over this.
9183,"I'm a journalist for a women's health and wellbeing magazine and am looking to speak to women in their 30s and 40s who have overcome anxiety in different ways – through CBT, other therapies, changing their life circumstances, or whatever it is."
9184,I'm getting help on the NHS but it will take a while to arrange my therapy.
9185,I go to a therapist sometimes for the assault situation but I don't like going because being there just reminds me of what happened.
9186,It's not perfect but it's something that helps me keep a little calmer till I can get to my doctors and then see a therapist and that seems near in possible where I live.
9187,Anyone in the UK know of any therapists which I could see outside of the NHS which aren't pricey or easier to see?
9188,"I have been going to therapy, and it is somewhat helpful, however we have been discussing maybe taking medicine."
9189,"He was treated for depression (various types of medication, therapy with a lady he really liked) long before I knew him, eventually came off of medication to try to manage it on his own, and since then has done really well."
9190,He is *sort of* seeing a therapist.
9191,He's also completely anxious about finding a different therapist to talk to about depression/anxiety.
9192,"I'd really like him to get serious about therapy and talk to someone on a more regular basis, but I also hate pushing for him to do more when he's already so stressed."
9193,"So, was wondering, would therapy be useful for someone like me when I know I have it and I know it's stupid?"
9194,"I have been to a therapist one time, who helped me to realize that I'm not going crazy (lol) but I haven't been since."
9195,I started seeing a therapist a few months ago and she's recommended I go see a psychiatrist and get on some sort of SSRI.
9196,"I keep scheduling appointments to see a therapist, but I never go, now the health center won't schedule me for anything because I never show up."
9197,"Went to therapy, was on meds, etc."
9198,Been out of therapy for over a year now and have been doing pretty well.
9199,"Long story short: 2007ish, GAD, no money for therapy, prescribed Xanax 0.25 3x/day, stupidly changed it to 0.75-1mg 1x/day (at night)."
9200,The therapy didn't do much for me.
9201,"I have PTSD from a tornado when i was 5, and i finally told the story in my group therapy session today, because we were talking about how memories can distort your perception of the present and it was storming outside."
9202,"I sometimes have trouble describing all of this, so I typed this up to read to my therapist."
9203,I finally went to see a therapist for my depression and went to see her religiously for months.
9204,"I'm currently on medications that are working fantastic, and am in cognitive behavioural therapy."
9205,"Thus far I have tried meditation nightly, therapy, and psychiatric help multiple times, but nothing seems to work."
9206,"And yeah, meds and therapy are already in the picture."
9207,"Only thing is the therapist hasn't called back yet to get me in there, so I have had to deal with a heightened and overall panic and fear."
9208,Is it worth it to talk to a therapist?
9209,"I go to therapy, I'm sober, I'm doing my best to enjoy the things I once set high goals for but just as a form of enjoyment."
9210,"I plan to make an appointment with my therapist tomorrow, but I need help until then."
9211,"Now, I had never been to a therapist for anxiety, but I had taken enough biology to know that I could trick my body into calming down."
9212,I've tried to go to therapists before and I just broke down crying from how freaked out I was.
9213,So I ended up having therapy for the first time on Thursday.
9214,"The first thirty minutes of the session, the therapist spent talking to my mom."
9215,"When it was my turn to talk to the therapist, I was scared."
9216,"My therapist just asked me simple questions like who I live with, what classes I take at school and how much sleep do I get."
9217,"I know the first visit goes like this where the therapist tries to get to know you, but not once did I feel like she was taking me serious about my anxiety."
9218,"At lunch time, my mom asked me about therapy from the previous day and I just broke down."
9219,"My mom then called the therapist, scheduled an appointment for tomorrow, and then called a psychiatrist and the social worker at my school."
9220,"I can understand being upset about things that were big fuck ups, but I obsess over small things like: words I wish I had said differently, or papers that I wrote late yet still turned in on time, and even really dumb things like accidentally bumping into someone in the hallway...

Not in therapy or on meds currently because of insurance issues, so I feel kind of alone in this."
9221,I've talked to my therapist about it  but she says I first have to know what is triggering it in the first place (I think I've figured it out finally.
9222,"I have a lot of problems with agoraphobia which are preventing me from going to therapy and getting the help I need, and my family is just not equipped to take care of me and it's getting out of hand."
9223,I was unable to work and was unable to afford therapy.
9224,With the affordable care act I was able to get into therapy.
9225,I started therapy last March.
9226,I was very fortunate that I found a therapist that understands anxiety disorders and was willing to come to my house.
9227,When I started therapy I had been housebound for two years.
9228,I worked with my therapist.
9229,My therapist taught me to add another option.
9230,Each week I would go over this with my therapist.
9231,Not all therapist are a good fit though.
9232,Don't be afraid to fire a therapist if the fit is not there.
9233,I haven't been diagnosed with any social anxiety problems but I've been in therapy for a few years for other reasons.
9234,"I have a break from therapy for a few weeks and can't see my usual counselor about this, and before now I've avoided talking about it because I thought it was 'normal', though now I can see this anxiety is affecting me a lot."
9235,My mom took me to some therapists but I couldn't talk about anything.
9236,"He has anxiety attacks where he cannot control even his body let alone his thoughts and is currently seeing a therapist who is practicing CBT with him, however, he has done CBT before, with therapists and alone and it hasn't worked."
9237,He feels like everything the therapist is telling him to do throughout a panic attack he already does and as the person who is there with him whenever they do happen i know that he has tried.
9238,"I've experimented with al sorts of supplements, have gone to therapy and even tried medication (currently on zoloft)."
9239,She has spoken to therapists in the past (regarding her diagnosis with Aspergers) but said none of it was ever beneficial.
9240,"My boyfriend also expressed that he'd like to learn how to help me, maybe even talk to my therapist (who I see about once a month for social anxiety and bipolar disorder, as well as a psychiatrist who prescribes me meds)."
9241,"I have been having severe anxiety lately, I haven't been diagnosed with anything (I'm terrified of going to therapy or anything like that, I know I will have to go sooner or later) Anyways, I've been having a lot of stress in my life and I just cant handle it."
9242,"My therapist says I'm progressing in some ways, but I feel like I'm still stuck in the darkness I've been dealing with for months now."
9243,I also am in a very bad situation of not having and insurance to go to any doctors or therapists to seek help.
9244,I was just prescribed Ativan/lorazepam by my doctor as a temporary medication to take as needed (when I'm feeling really anxious) until I can get an appointment with a therapist and psychiatrist.
9245,"i take medication + go to therapy, but i find that i'm actually quite in love with a lot of aspects of my anxiety."
9246,I started seeing a therapist last week and we have planned on at least 6 sessions but I don't go back until Wednesday.
9247,"I've been working with a therapist and while I've made great progress with coping skills, I can't help but think I'll never be in control unless I go back to medication."
9248,"This can be helped with cognitive behavioral therapy, as most of you know."
9249,She has been to therapy twice in the last six years since her father passed.
9250,The reason why I wanted her to go back to therapy was because we want to have children.
9251,"Her most recent therapist thought she had OCD which I would strongly disagree with, I believe she has GAD, but the therapy is the same essentially just cognitive behavioral therapy."
9252,Yesterday we fought about how I still wanted her to go to therapy before we tried to have children.
9253,"Reddit, How do I urge my wife to practice CBT and go back to therapy?"
9254,I feel like if I go to some type of therapy they will just feed those feelings that I do some type of unique problem just to make money from the therapy I would be receiving.
9255,I have also tried EMDR therapy because of the time I was hit by a car and that did nothing.
9256,Please tell me some therapies/treatments that work for you.
9257,"So I was diagnosed with GAD about 4 months ago, I got prescribed 50mg Zoloft and I started therapy."
9258,"I've been in and out of therapy for the past year, and it does genuinely help me."
9259,I had an appointment with my therapist on Friday.
9260,"The other day, during my time with my therapist/psychologist, he/she told me that when I think I am having a panic attack, that makes me panic more."
9261,"*

I know I should see a therapist, but what can I do to fight anxiety and these triggers?"
9262,"Also, how do I go about telling my therapist I think I have this?"
9263,"I guess I posted this in r/Anxiety because I've seen a therapist for anxiety issues, and I feel like this situation is contributing."
9264,Because I'm not working my insurance isn't that good so the nearest I can see a therapist is August 27th.
9265,"So, to recap: I'm always exhausted, anxiety makes me have severe insomnia, my insurance isn't that good so I can't see a therapist or psych for a month when an appointment becomes available, my grad school starts August 25 which I will not be able to do because it's evening classes and I'd be too tired to drive the 35 miles there and back safely, without grad school I have no clue what I'd do for a career to move away from my stressful, dysfunctional family and making calls to do any of this is difficult seeing as my insomnia means I'm falling asleep when everything's opening and waking up when their closing."
9266,"I'm seeing a therapist and psychiatrist regularly, but yeah, not really sure what I'm doing with my life or if I'll be able to do anything with my life."
9267,"I went to a Depression Bipolar Support Alliance meeting once with my fiance’ and didn’t really like it…It was kinda scary which I can understand but everyone there was talking about their therapists and their medications and I felt like I didn’t belong or that they wouldn’t accept me if I didn’t have those things…
I’ve been having a very hard time with these things."
9268,Is this something I need therapy to fix?
9269,Ive decided Im going to stop taking all anxiety medications and deal with this through cognitive behavioral therapy but Ive been feeling like SHIT that last few days.
9270,Has anyone found success with cbt or hypnotherapy for situational anxiety induced insomnia?
9271,"I don't have a therapist at the moment, though I'm working on fixing that, so I figured I would ask and talk about it here."
9272,"I found [this thing](http://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2005/11/02/lack-of-focus-anxiety-depression/) that I just relate with so much, and I also found an email address for my university counsellor."
9273,I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for a while and used to go to a cognitive therapist in high school and undergraduate.
9274,"I had history in comedy and theater, and found standup to be what I like to call ""free therapy""."
9275,"A bit about me, I was never formally diagnosed by a doctor but I have been treated in therapy for (what looks like extreme) GAD for the past eight months."
9276,It's also happened a couple of times in group therapy.
9277,"No SSRI or SNRI has done anything to help me manage my anxiety, and therapy isn't getting me anywhere."
9278,"I had a Doctor Appointment next Thursday, where I was going to tell him about everything and get helo to see a new therapist, but I don't know the likelyhood of me going now that I am re-experiencing trauma."
9279,I just called a new therapist to set up an appointment.
9280,I have been seeing a psychotherapist for changing around ADD/ADHD meds (the one that prescribes and diagnosis?
9281,"I can't afford therapy at the moment, and I'm okay with that, but therapists are basically all that I can find."
9282,I started seeing a therapist this week to help me cope.
9283,"The only person I have right now like that is my therapist and while she's really nice and just casual enough so I don't feel /too/ anxious, I can't bring myself to talk when confronted with some things."
9284,"I ended up going to therapy (which did help with my recovery, please do seek professional help if you feel similarly), I turned down the medicine for personal reasons."
9285,I currently live without medication or therapy and neither are very financially accessible for me.
9286,if i share this stuff with my therapist what would happen?
9287,"Both my doctor and my therapist are on vacation now for the next 1 and 2 weeks respectively, and I feel completely alone and I don't know how to deal with all this."
9288,"My therapist pretty much told me that she was ignoring her phone during her vacation after I talked to her last time, despite earlier saying that I could talk to her but that there would be a delay."
9289,"I have a safety plan and all with my therapist, but I am terrified of non prescreened mental health professionals."
9290,"It only really worked when I could contact my therapist, so now my safety plan doesn't feel safe at all, and has been rendered useless."
9291,"I have anxiety, it used to be crippling to say the least but im slowly getting better on my own (no meds or therapist) but one thing I cant seem to shake is my breathing issues (hyperventilating)."
9292,I'm in therapy.
9293,He also helped me set an appointment TOMORROW with a therapist.
9294,"Currently I am taking Symbyax 6/20, Klonopin, multivitamin +B complex, and fish oil, and go to therapy every other week or weekly as needed."
9295,I am doing everything I am supposed to do with psychiatry and psychotherapy so why does this keep happening!
9296,I started seeing a therapist recently.
9297,"So I'm currently being taught mindfulness and meditation techniques by my therapist, and I was wondering if anyone else has had experience with this?"
9298,I can't afford therapy or medication.
9299,I have seen a therapist twice so far for my anxiety.
9300,Looking back I realize I have always had anxiety problems but haven't gotten professional help for it because of a bad experience with therapists in 6th grade.
9301,"In sixth grade I had anorexia for a few months because of stress to get all A's and it angered me that the therapist wouldn't really listen but kept asking ""what's the worst thing that could happen."""
9302,So anyways I kind of despise therapists now because of that but am not sure of what to do.
9303,"I have had a loooooot of issues in my life, lots of trauma and lots of therapy."
9304,Thinking about going to a one on one therapy session makes me anxious because I've done that before and it is just not my thing.
9305,I was recommended to an inner ear therapist because that could be the problem.
9306,I did CBT for 6 months with two therapists at the same office.
9307,It wasn't until the second therapist when she told me that I should try taking the xanax three times a day where I gave up on that.
9308,"I went therapist free for a few months and still had bad anxiety, I tried to limit myself to xanax 1-2 times per week but that was proving difficult."
9309,"I've gone to about 6 or so sessions with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and today my therapist suggested I explore meds to help ""take the edge off""."
9310,Should I find a new therapist?
9311,"Hi all,

I'm having second thoughts about my therapist and I'm paranoid that her approach isn't helping, but it is."
9312,"I noticed that she left a Yelp review for another therapist in the area (a very positive Yelp review), so I did a quick search on him."
9313,I have not mentioned it to my therapist yet but I'm going to during my next appointment.
9314,"I told her everything about what I've been feeling and thinking, and she told me that I should start medication and therapy as soon as possible."
9315,Does anyone here have anything simple like this I can use just to tide me over until I hand my dissertation in on Thursday (I am seeing a new therapist on Wednesday and hoping they will offer some coping mechanisms too)?
9316,"hello there

i've been dating this girl for a year and a half, she means the world to me

recently, i was up late and had an episode of relationship anxiety after she went to sleep where i began to worry about our future, i realized it was irrational but the more i worried about it, the more i made it a problem

i've had issues with this before that i resolved over time

when i'm letting myself be happier with her, i'm happier than i ever have been but right now i keep getting stuck in negative feedback loops where i forget the magnitude of my relationship and how much she adores me and what i mean to her and what she means to me

and then during these, i manage to push myself farther away and distance myself from emotions and it's concerning

the last thing in the world i want to do is let her go, it's just hard coping with my anxiety right now

one moment i'll be happy and the next, i'll be stuck in an irrational negative feedback loop yet again

i just really need some help, i'm going to my therapist monday

in the meantime, how can i stop worrying about how i'm feeling and just feel good again?"
9317,So I went to therapy just long enough to get the school off moms back ( till I turned 18) then she refused to take me anymore.
9318,"I finally started therapy earlier this year, after struggling to get help for many years."
9319,"And I don't know if I just had wrong expectations, or if my therapist is weird, or if all is perfectly normal."
9320,Has anyone had similar experiences with therapy?
9321,"I'm currently looking into therapy, and have found a therapist that specializes in my issues."
9322,"I've written and rewritten the email to this particular therapist, but have yet to send anything."
9323,"Since then, we have worked on him being a service dog for me (and therapy dog for others)."
9324,I have dragged him everywhere as a sort of exposure therapy and we have both done really well!
9325,"I've been seeing a therapist every week for these past few years and, unable to truly cope with it with many other resources I've exhausted, we both decided it's best if I go back to something I wasn't very keen on going back to, which is medication."
9326,"Now that I've stopped taking it all of my previous symptoms are back again, and I've stopped going to both clinic therapists I was seeing on a bi-weekly basis."
9327,"I don't leave my house much, when I was seeing my clinical therapists I'd see them and aside from that I wouldn't leave my house for weeks at a time."
9328,"I am medicated, and am currently seeing a new therapist so that's fine but when I'm not doing that I feel helpless."
9329,Because of the panic attack and the fact that I have been having issues with anxiety for so long he prescribed escitalprom 10mg and that I see a therapist for CBT sessions.
9330,I was told today by my therapist that I have anxiety.
9331,"I've been to therapy before, it does help."
9332,So I've been seeing a therapist for the last few months.
9333,"In the last session she said that she felt like I was giving excuses for everything and not really trying, so she was thinking that we should stop the therapy."
9334,I think the only reason that she didn't end up cancelling the therapy last time was because I cry a lot and it makes her feel bad.
9335,"Thanks for reading if you got this far, you're a better person than I :P

Edit: Just to add, therapy is definately an interesting experience."
9336,I see a couple different therapists and psychiatrists throughout the years.
9337,I was in some really good therapy too.
9338,"I'm not trying to provide therapy for anyone, just friendship."
9339,"Due to my age no doctors has wanted to do testosterone replacement therapy, especially since I want to have kids in the future."
9340,"2- Therapy

I was going to therapy once a week for a couple of months."
9341,"If anyone has questions about my therapy, medication ( i was scared shitless to start a SSRI), meditation or anything else."
9342,Perhaps it is over-dramatic (as someone else said) ...but I had to see a therapist regardless.
9343,Probably therapy?
9344,"But I've ran out on my therapist a few weeks ago, and on my flute teacher a few weeks before that."
9345,"My boyfriend has dealt with anxiety too, so he had his own whirlwind of emotions and thoughts to sort through and this was before I had started seeing a therapist and didn't understand what anxiety was or even how to deal with it."
9346,I have a therapist and plan to discuss it with her in depth.
9347,I tried therapy.
9348,"I've been diagnosed with dysthymia, depression, and SAD, depending on the doctor I was seeing, and I also have bulimia nervosa (getting much better a year after starting therapy for that though), used to cut, have coped with insomnia for years (the real kind, not just I stay up late), etc."
9349,"I've been to psychologists, sleep specialists, and therapists."
9350,So last Monday we went to a psychiatrist that was recommended by my therapist so we don't have to go to so many doctors.
9351,"If so, should I see primary care doctor or therapist?"
9352,In the end I went to a different therapist and decided to study linguistics on whim.
9353,I'm a high school student who has recently started seeing a therapist around once a week for social and overall anxiety.
9354,"I'd always thought going to a therapist would be a great thing for me to do, as it would help me start finally becoming more relaxed and an overall happier person."
9355,"But, I've seen my therapist 4 or 5 times, and each time I've come out feeling extremely stressed and unhappy."
9356,"Every time I see my therapist or someone who looks like her, I start to have a very minor panic attack."
9357,"Also, I've come to start disliking my therapist more and more with each session."
9358,"Do you think it's my therapist that's the problem, and going to a different one would be more beneficial?"
9359,"Anyways, I started looking for therapists after I got back to work, and quickly started to feel my anxiousness creeping in again."
9360,"Currently, I'm not in therapy but I am in the process of obtaining treatment."
9361,"He has reassured me that these fears are okay, and my therapist has told me as much as well - that it makes sense to be a little nervous about a relationship moving to the next level (moving in together) and that for ""normal"" people, this is still a stressful event."
9362,Should I see if he can some into a therapy sesh with me and we can talk about it then?
9363,"I've been treating it differently, I tried therapist, full dosage of Zoloft (150mg.)"
9364,"I don't know if it was my last couple therapy sessions kicking in, talking to a few close friends and family about me struggling, or my new med dosage finally kicking in, but I had a lot of good days in a row."
9365,"Since I have started my new job (I have been working there for 1-2 months now) at an eating disorder rehab center, I have noticed that I have intense anxiety attacks while with the clients in group therapy sessions along with the pre-work anxiety."
9366,I had my second session with my therapist today.
9367,How could a *therapy* session trigger the worst panic attack I've had since I was 17?
9368,"We're sure it will be some kind of therapy but hoping it's not a ""tell me about your childhood"" kind of thing."
9369,I am in therapy and I thought I was getting somewhere.
9370,"realized what was going on, got help from a therapist, turned in my assignments late with a note, promised myself and my mom it wasn't going to happen this semester

then my long term partner left me and my grandfather died, a week apart, two weeks into the semester."
9371,"I went to therapy for a few years and twice i thought I was good enough to stop, I thought I had achieved normalcy."
9372,"The last time I left my therapist I was poised to work at my dad's office, which I did for a while until one day I was just not ready to do anything new, and everything was new that day."
9373,What really gets me is that twice now everything seemed resolved by my therapist and I was going to be able to be normal but it just doesn't work.
9374,If I go back to therapy I'm sure I would go for a while and eventually feel like everything gonna be good again!
9375,I emailed a similar message to my former therapist and she just wants to talk again.
9376,"As far as meds and therapy go, I hate having to be dependant on medication, and the therapy I have tried in the past didn't work, because all I could think of was, ""this person doesn't care about me, she's just getting paid for this"", so it didn't really help."
9377,"What's most important - in this ""hard period"" medicine wasn't helping me - I can say it confidently because I've tried plenty of different doctors/pills/therapies/etc."
9378,"I have no idea what to do, therapy is too expensive in my country, one session is half my month pay, I have no idea how to help her, she is trying to stop smoking too, and I see some progress while she is with me, but as soon as she knows I'm leaving her the anxiety kicks in, I don't want to see her like this, I've tried listening to her and letting her tell me anything, it has help but only to an extend, I want her to have a normal fulfilling life, I know it's possible, I know she can do it, what can I do as her SO to help her?"
9379,I eventually got it all under control after seeing a therapist for a little bit.
9380,I'm currently on Zoloft and Wellbutrin and seeing a therapist.
9381,He was very nonchalant about the whole thing saying there could be worse things to do when anxious than cleaning and he put me on a therapy waiting list.
9382,Some therapists have helped me find good insight.
9383,"In closing, if you feel like there’s something wrong with your therapist’s approach, you might be right."
9384,"The therapists I have had have been kind, but resistant to hearing me."
9385,"My therapist said that going to visit a college and auditing a class would help with getting over my fear or going to college, but I feel like visiting today just made it worse."
9386,I have a therapist and psychiatrist and am on some meds but now I'm getting afraid of what the meds are doing to my brain and body.
9387,I currently go to therapy but am not on any medication.
9388,I won't have a therapist at school but I have the university clinic open to me for meds.
9389,"I’ve wanted to try therapy for a few years now but had no insurance to cover the expenses, despite being Canadian."
9390,"Now they've given me a choice between being in a 12-week group therapy session, or going one-on-one with a therapist for 8-15 weeks."
9391,"The drawback of the one-on-one therapy is that her trainee (therapist in training) HAS to be at every session, which I don't really like the idea of honestly."
9392,There's no doubt in my mind that if I went to the 1 on 2 therapy I'd hold back on certain details and information about my life.
9393,And if I'm not open with my therapist what's the point of therapy?
9394,Or is it ok to not share everything with a therapist?
9395,The therapist said I should get back to her by the end of the week about the 1 on 2 sessions.
9396,"I'm thinking of telling her that I'll give it a try for a few sessions, and if I find that it doesn't work, I'd like to put in the group therapy in May."
9397,(Either that or I'll just quit therapy in general for now)
9398,"Nor have I had therapy, despite it being recommended by teachers :/

Thanks for reading."
9399,"My question is: While I am attempting to work through my issues with a therapist, what can we do to push past this and enjoy each other once again?"
9400,"also:  My counselor is trying to get me to change my self talk or internal dialogue, and my way of problem solving etc in relation to my anxiety but I just dont understand what she is trying to do and can't seem to wrap my head around her instructions - I guess she is trying behavioral therapy?"
9401,Edit: Today I met with my therapist and we worked through possible solutions.
9402,"Currently in therapy, just made an appointment to talk with a psychiatrist about medication (which is a whole different beast) but have been struggling the past few months with pain issues."
9403,I don't want meds or therapy.
9404,"I have an appointment with a therapist on Wednesday, but it's so hard to hold onto hope that this will get better."
9405,"I'm back at home right now and I do have a doctor up here, but I might also wait until I'm back on campus because I'd prefer to be seeing a therapist in tandem and I don't want to settle down with one here with only one month before I move back."
9406,I was then directed to a therapist and prescribed anxiety pills.
9407,parents end up dropping 30k+ of second kid's money on unnecessary therapies and rehab centers for 17 years when second kid doesn't have a drug problem and does well in school with dreams of going to college.
9408,i've got a great therapist here but i feel the need to get out at all costs.
9409,I have gotten meds (ssri and beta blockers) with my standard insurance but I really want therapy so that I use my time on the meds to build up better habits.
9410,"I'm wondering:

1) How many sessions does it take to get benefit from therapy?"
9411,My mom has not lived with me since January and I'm making a lot of progress in therapy and it's becoming a great tool to use and not just a venting space.
9412,"I recently read about knitting or crocheting as a form of therapy so I took myself to a craft store, bought some yarn and have been teaching myself with the help of tutorials on Youtube and Pinterest."
9413,"Some of my direct and extended family members also experience it, but as far my direct family goes, only my dad and I have been severe enough to have been diagnosed, prescribed meds, and sent to therapy."
9414,"19 years old, summer before my second year at college I got help; put on antidepressants, xanax, and required therapy."
9415,I need therapy and likely need to be medicated.
9416,"I have been diagnosed with GAD, and tried talk therapy and multiple rounds of various meds, but I did not find either approach helpful (actually I found both seemed to make the anxiety worse, and not in a worse-before-better progress sort of way- just worse)."
9417,"I left my first therapy session with this CBT print-out:

* Write down your goals for counseling
* Your mantra: [we decided on 'I'm calm and relaxed']
* Say your mantra 50 times a day
* Write down your negative thoughts (the core ones)
* As soon as you have done that, say STOP to yourself, visualize a stop sign (if you want), and then flip the thought around to its positive opposite or say your mantra."
9418,"Here is the link to the teaser: https://vimeo.com/114246174

It's a comedy about a guy with social anxiety who alongside another group therapy member runs away to complete a list of romantic comedy cliches."
9419,About a guy with social anxiety who alongside another group therapy member runs away to complete a list of romantic comedy cliches.
9420,"I have had therapy on and off, medications (that work) on and off (I'm hoping to go renew my prescription soon)."
9421,The thought of having to go back into therapy is stopping me from feeling ok.
9422,"I have been to doctors since high school, seen therapists and have been on many different types of medication for depression, ADHD and Anxiety."
9423,I have been going to therapy (on and off) for nearly 10 years now.
9424,"Anyways, I've reached the point that I feel like I need to go do some therapy."
9425,That my therapist and people working within the field of psychology will stop trying to get to the root of my problems if I start taking medication (I know this might sound weird but I sort of like the attention I get from psychologist because I've *never* had anyone try to understand the way I think before.
9426,I've been to therapy and have done everything short of taking drugs.
9427,"I understand that alot of subscribers here go to therapists or psychiatrists, or what ever the proper term may be."
9428,"Is there some sort of medication, or therapy?"
9429,I'm in therapy but I haven't been going much lately because things are getting worse and I'm gonna let down my therapist and what's the point anyway?
9430,"Hi,
I've been seeing my therapist for about 3 months, skipped the last two sessions because I'm so conflicted."
9431,This is the first time I've really tried therapy and stayed consistent.
9432,"Just if anyone has been in therapy, do you think I should see improvement within 3 months?"
9433,I've never been to a doc or therapist about my anxiety/hypochondria but I'm starting to think I should.
9434,"Anyway, the reason I feel like I haven't talked to a doctor or therapist is 1: Because I'm always away and 2: Because I don't actually know If I'm having real issues."
9435,I called my therapist that I haven't seen in a while and left a voicemail to set up an appointment.
9436,"I'm no stranger to anxiety; I'm on meds that work most of the time and I have a therapist who is fantastic, but I'm not doing too well at the moment and I know the exact reason why."
9437,"It'll just be easier to list them rather than explain them:

* not having communication
* not being able to know someone is okay
* being cut off from the world
* this kind of retreat in general (so much history, being discussed in therapy)
* not communicating in general
* not knowing what is going on in the world
* fear of him coming back and realizing that I'm a pessimistic person (although he has assured me that will never happen)
* fear of over-reacting (see the humor!)"
9438,"I'm currently unemployed (and am so afraid to apply to places, but I really do need to....also working on this in therapy) and I need to finish up my website so that I can put in applications (I need to be able to show off my portfolio)."
9439,"I have therapy on Monday, thank god, but I just feel like I'm not doing as well as I want to be or as well as I should, even though I'm slowly by surely getting things done."
9440,I've never gone to therapy for my anxiety but I think weekly meetings once I'm at school would be a good idea?
9441,"I was talking to my mom and she offered me to go a therapist and talk and I figured this was good, only my mom doesnt really know about my dad not wanting to be together but only for me."
9442,But is there away I could go see a therapist without my parents consent I suppose if I have a way to pay?
9443,"I am also on no medications for it and my parents would rather me not take any so kind of out of the question, or after talking with my therapist would she be the best to call it."
9444,After that I saw a therapist for a few months and was prescribed xanax for panic attacks just in case I got one.
9445,One of the reasons why it came back recently was because I tried to ignore those anxious feelings and I stopped seeing my therapist.
9446,"I recently began taking 25mg of Zoloft, began seeing a therapist, started going to the gym three times a week, practicing breathing daily, outdoor walks, forced social exposure."
9447,I asked her if she would be okay with seeing a therapist.
9448,I've been given a month leave from work but am only seeing a therapist once a week.
9449,"EDIT: my therapist steered me away from inpatient saying that was too much, that I should call a couple places to see if they did an intensive outpatient program."
9450,"He can't afford treatment/therapy right now because college is expensive, but he really needs the help."
9451,I didn't think I had anxiety until I decided to go to see a trauma therapist.
9452,"My therapist has given me a few devices to help with the attacks, but I really want to keep going through my own memory and realize how the anxiety has affected my life growing up."
9453,I don't know if my therapist is the best for me...
9454,Do i have to make an appointment with a GP and then get a referral to a therapist?
9455,I'm sure anyone would direct me to a therapist but I really don't have time or money for that and I rather do it by myself.
9456,"I have visited the doctors and was prescribed Ativan, and have seen a therapist about twice."
9457,"It is somewhat relieving in my mind to know I have backup plans with the meds and therapy, but my mind keeps telling me that I'll have to live like this forever."
9458,"I've had an anxiety/panic/depression disorder since I was about 15, i went to therapy for a little while, took medication for a bit and for the most part things have been okay I suppose."
9459,"Every therapist I've been to has said the same thing ""meccaandsoul, you don't have schizophrenia I want you to get that out of your mind""...."
9460,"Between good meds, a good therapist, and a year of practice coping, it's coming together."
9461,I've been in therapy a lot and it doesn't really remove anxiety or make it lessen with time.
9462,"After having an extreme anxiety attack earlier this year in which suicidal thoughts and thoughts of how I'll never find the perfect woman, I sought help from a therapist."
9463,I was typing up something about my own personal experiences as an example when I got to something that I guess was really deep seated in my mind-- I kinda almost publicly admitted to something that I'd never really realized until recently that my therapist has pretty much been telling me without actually telling me-- that I was taught to think and feel about myself the way that I do.
9464,"I'm on anxiety medications and have been to therapy, but when it comes to directing my own life, I take a backseat and let others do it for me."
9465,"I am not currently medicated, and I would prefer not to be, as my psychotherapist was never quite able to hit on the appropriate pill or dosage."
9466,"I am considering more intensive cognitive therapy, but until that begins, I worry (naturally!)"
9467,"I see a therapist, but I can't go as often as I'd like because I can't afford as many sessions."
9468,"So I went to therapy today, and instead of taking the bus straight home like I ought to've, I went inside the mall because I'm an idiot."
9469,I've recently started seeing a therapist about my anxiety and depression and she's asked me to make a list of all the symptoms of anxiety I experience and put them in order from least to most severe.
9470,I've tried so many medications and I'm bad at therapy.
9471,"She's currently seeing a therapist and taking Prozac, but that can only do so much."
9472,"BUT OVERALL, I am extremely nervous about my first time seeing a therapist."
9473,I was not diagnosed by an actual doctor but a therapist did say I might have it.
9474,"I have never gone to a therapist, mostly because I don't know how to go about doing that, and I'm also kind of afraid."
9475,"This has manifested in other ways as well (it took me the better part of ten years to finally see a therapist, just because it was too terrifying to make an appointment, especially when I wasn't feeling so great to start with.)"
9476,I found a therapist around the time I went on the sertraline.
9477,"I guess it's possible that  I just need to find the ""right"" meds and the ""right"" therapist, but I don't know how to do that when even just going to the post office or answering emails is almost as much as I can bear."
9478,I'm on the wrong meds and have the wrong therapist.
9479,Last year I hurt a bunch of my friends because I told them too much instead of seeing a therapist.
9480,"Methods of treating anxiety disorders and panic attacks in children include:

•	Counseling or psychotherapy can help reveal the source of a child’s anxiety, as well as reassuring the child that panic attacks and anxious feelings are not his or her fault because they may suffer from guilt and self-blame."
9481,•	Cognitive-behavioral therapy teaches children skills for dealing with panic attacks and the anxiety that causes them.
9482,I am starting with a new therapist next week but I am frantic and getting more physically and mentally ill by the day because of the stress.
9483,"I've been extremely anxious most of my adult life, to the point of no longer being able to leave the house, but I started a group therapy program and was feeling a little bit better until my body decided to be a dick by making my left lung repeatedly collapse over and over again for absolutely no reason (6 times total, technical term is spontaneous pneumothorax)."
9484,I'm also on a search for a new therapist.
9485,I've tried therapy and several medicines and I can't seem to beat it.
9486,I haven't sought therapy until today.
9487,Should I push myself to make the phone call to a CBT center and talk to a therapist?
9488,Stopped seeing my therapist because of serious money issues.
9489,"I've done therapy, drugs (prescribed) patience with the mundane lifestyle that EVERYONE has to go through."
9490,Its ruining my life and I went to a therapist for a while and it didn't help at all.
9491,I'm currently looking into therapy for my anxiety.
9492,"I have never seen a therapist, I usually don't share the deep things with anyone."
9493,So I need to hear success stories about therapy.
9494,How has therapy helped you cope with your anxiety?
9495,I'm undergoing exposure therapy for agoraphobia and tapering down on Valium (a dependence developed thanks partially to waiting so long for access to therapy).
9496,"I plan on enrolling in cognitive behavioral therapy once I can afford to, hopefully sometime during my next school semester - this is the optimal way of dealing with anxiety FOREVER."
9497,"So I went to my new therapist, and he said to ask yourself questions so you stay present."
9498,"I managed to push myself into therapy for a few weeks, i never made follow up appointments after that, i got too afraid that the therapist would think i didnt need to be there."
9499,"I'm currently seeing a therapist in university health but she's so often booked that I rarely have time to see her, and this weekend I had a horrible panic attack where I just felt like I couldn't get it all done for the life of me, which made me more panicked, etc."
9500,Do you think this is good reason to ask for extra credit if I at least get a note from my therapist?
9501,She is seeing starting to see a therapist but due to our finances she can only see him a few times a month.
9502,Since I was well versed on anxiety and cognitive behavioral therapy (which I taught to family members of those with mental illnesses) it wasn't hard to incorporate those positive practices in to my life.
9503,This is where the cognitive behavioral therapy comes in to save the day....or tried to at least.
9504,"I've also just started seeing a therapist, to further help me who has suggested CBT."
9505,To preface this I will say that I am now 21 and currently searching for a therapist to help me work this out but it could be months before that happens.
9506,I'm seeing my therapist tonight but I'm not really sure how to talk to him about this.
9507,"I saw a few psychiatrists and therapists when I was younger for depression and ADD (they couldn't decide what), but I think I would like to go again."
9508,"and I'd gotten it mostly under control with therapy, educating myself in a smart manner, exercise, yoga, meditation and eating well."
9509,"I've been seeing a therapist and I have an appointment to see a doctor about meds in a month which hopefully is going to help me cope, but the type of career I have been looking at that would be something I could be happier doing is working with animals in some capacity."
9510,"I first had prominent issues with the later during my mid teens and went through talk therapy and CBT which helped and everything was as ""fine"" as such things can be."
9511,"So this time, after going to see a Uni-provided therapist for a couple of initial meetings, I wanted to avoid the pill side of things."
9512,However due to the campus centre being overwhelmed with patients it seems I won't get to access proper talk therapy until the start of April.
9513,"I've been on and off various meds over the years, and am currently on Zoloft, Adderall, Klonopin, and Ambien, and seeing a psychotherapist."
9514,Since then she always went in and out of different forms of therapy.
9515,"My main issue is that she sees therapy and medication as personal failings, and doesn't acknowledge anxiety and depression as legitimate medical problems."
9516,"I am level-headed and vastly patient, but she needs therapy, which she can get for free at college but not at home in the summer."
9517,"Maybe it's just that I'm poor and can't afford a good psychiatrist, but every therapist I've seen has done nothing but parrot what I've said to them in an ""understanding"" voice."
9518,My PCP dignosed me with depression and my therapist has placed me more firmly as having anxiety so... hi!
9519,"Basically, I have scoliosis, and my mom's always trying to send me to different therapists."
9520,"He's on medication and has seen therapists, but he never had a handle over his anxiety."
9521,"I exercise, see a therapist, and do take meds."
9522,In the past my doctors have recognised that i have anger problems and anxiety however no medication or therapy has been given.
9523,"I started seeing a therapist on campus three weeks ago, and I'm not sure if it's helping yet as we only meet once a week."
9524,We are going to see a therapist next week but he has already told me he will leave me if I tell the dr what he has said
9525,"A therapist and doctor both suggested an SSRI but I have my doubts about them: libido effects, addictive potential affecting you if you even miss a day, memory impairment, terrible withdrawal brain zaps and worse feelings afterwards."
9526,Is medication the right move or therapy?
9527,"I have also delicately brought up therapy (not necessarily specific to her, just in general), and I have been met with a response something like this ""Therapy might work for some, but it's just not for me""

Anyways, here is the specific situation I'm looking for advice on."
9528,I have an appointment to see a therapist coming up.
9529,I have never seen a therapist.
9530,I've been to a therapist but it didn't feel like they were much help.
9531,"I am already in therapy and trying to up my self care routine (meditation, exercise, yoga)."
9532,"The worst part is that every person speak to about this, college professors, my therapist, all agree that my observations have a great deal of truth to them, so I can't be completely deluded."
9533,"I used to see a therapist during a period in which my depression was really bad, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but never given any medication."
9534,"About a year ago I saw another therapist, but we only met about 6 times."
9535,"Therapy doesn't really seem to do it for me, I can't bring myself to open up entirely and trust someone and both times I felt worse during therapy than after I stopped."
9536,"If you saw a therapist, did he/she help?"
9537,"My last therapist called me lazy, said what if my mom kicked me out and told me I'm not suffering, cancer patients are."
9538,"I am in therapy, but what is the best way to tell him that I failed the previous year and may be forced to drop out this year if I can't find the correct solution to being in school."
9539,"I've only been in therapy for a few months now, and only recently discovered that I have GAD as well as SAD."
9540,"Ever since I started going to therapy, I've found that I want to share EVERYTHING with someone else (in this instance, the girl I was trying to save things with and some of my close friends)."
9541,Can you take an SSRI and retrain that thread with therapy?
9542,"And I’ve not done much therapy, but I’m actually getting to where I’ll give it a shot just because, why not?"
9543,I have a therapist appointment on tuesday (I just started there) but I have a ways to go until then and I'm falling apart here.
9544,We tried to get her to see a therapist - who she then shades the truth with - and then claims that she already knows all of this - it doesn't work - so why bother.
9545,"I dont know why i dont get therapy, ive tried in the past once and it didnt seem to help."
9546,My therapist always used to tell me to just try living in the moment.
9547,"My friend snapped a picture of a massive one recently in our bathroom and I'm yet to have a shower there... so it's kind of a problem

I know central desensitisation is a really good therapy you can do yourself for this, and there's a game called Phobia Free recommended by the NHS but it's £18 and all it involves is working your way up to a virtual reality situation of holding a spider."
9548,"I went through several months of therapy but no longer have access to it (I'm looking, but the pickings are thin with my insurance)."
9549,"I want to tell my therapist about the anxiety, the insecurity, and the low self esteem."
9550,"I just started therapy (literally last week), but was wondering if I should talk to my Dr. about changing my SSRI."
9551,"I've tried therapy, but I haven't had much success."
9552,I have always struggled with depression and anxiety and briefly was in therapy for it.
9553,"My therapist says it is, but yet... ugh."
9554,I may need to travel alone for a few months at some point and I'm wondering if it'd be a good idea to ask my therapist about this.
9555,Have drugs or therapy been a great success for any of you?
9556,My therapist says that I am on the last electron on the last molecule of the control spectrum and that I need to learn to accept that I cannot control everything.
9557,"I have been in therapy for years, take Lamictal/Zyprexa/Klonopin, supplement it with herbals and vitamins, do deep breathing when I feel anxiety coming on, listen to relaxation videos before bed, but I still can't beat it."
9558,"For the past two years, my therapist has had me expose myself to situations where I am not completely in control, such as being around my family, letting my husband drive instead of me driving, and staying at work when I have an anxiety attack."
9559,"I feel I’m being “interrogated “and I feel like I’m being judged, and it clouds my judgment to ask rational, thought provoking questions to continue on the decision making trail, instead I can get defensive, which can shut down the person, because they don’t think I’m listening, when in reality, I guess I’m not, therapist told me to practice, intentional silences."
9560,"I mentioned this to my therapist and she told the fact that the obsessive thoughts faded with the cold sores was a sign that I don't have full blown OCD, but rather a sign my anxiety had gotten out of control."
9561,"If you got this far, I salute you, and only ask for some advice on where I should go from here, whether it be to therapy, a psychiatrist, or something else."
9562,"Though, before I begin therapy, I wanted to take a general consensus with others who experience similar issues:

Thoughts/tasks/stress/ideas occupy a physical space in my mind, and when it becomes too cluttered, I can't ""see"" past some of them in order to resolve others."
9563,"Thanks to being in talk therapy for a year and lexapro for 9 months (I have been off of it for a month now), I am totally surviving."
9564,"So no matter how foreign or scary or weird or whatever you may think about going to see a therapist, you should at least try it."
9565,"We've been talking about it frequently since the first time I experienced her anxiety attack, and she said she's gotten a hold of her old therapist and will be doing sessions with them again, but I don't know..."
9566,"She's also incredibly apprehensive about starting up therapy again because she feels like she's failed herself, because she hasn't needed it in several years."
9567,I would like to know if this is a normal side-effect of the medicine or if it is something I need to see my therapist about.
9568,"My parents took me to a therapist, and she said I had GAD with some depressive symptoms."
9569,"It's getting worse, and I'm thinking about going back to a therapist."
9570,I'm going to make an appointment for her with a therapist today.
9571,"I am going to be seeing a therapist or someone of the like soon, but my question is, should I take the medication or not?"
9572,I’ve been in therapy three times.
9573,That therapist told me in detail about how many people with anxiety become agoraphobic.
9574,As a result I don’t have much faith in therapists.
9575,I don’t know when I can even find the time to go to therapy.
9576,I have an appointment to see a therapist on the 13th.
9577,I'd been to many therapists but I never grieved openly.
9578,We're trying to get her hooked up with a therapist and new medication.
9579,"He then told me ""I dont want to come across as patronizing, but its really great you made the choice to come in here and that you had been doing exposure therapy."
9580,"But we dont think its in your best interest to give you any medication right now as we dont want it to interfere with your exposure therapy, and we think admitting you would be worse for you right now."""
9581,He had money for the best therapists in the country.
9582,"I go to a therapist/counselor but they don't really help, I just go back to my old habits of fearing of diseases.."
9583,We have been going to therapy as couple and individually to work in our issues.
9584,"I’ve been going for several years to different therapists, and they usually tell me I need to work on my bouts of depression &amp; anxiety."
9585,"I got my husband to start going to therapy about 6 months ago as well, and his sessions have evolved into couples therapy for us both."
9586,I'm glad to have my fiancé and therapist.
9587,"I want to go talk to a therapist just so that a professional can tell me what's up, you know?"
9588,"I started seeing a therapist for cognitive behavioral therapy and my panic attacks went away after a while yet I still deal with pretty severe anticipatory anxiety and medicate myself with illegally bough Xanax (I wouldn't say I abuse it, I just take .5 mg or so when I'm feeling overwhelmed)."
9589,"I (F24) use to have bad social anxiety, but I slowly grew out of it due to therapy and medication."
9590,I am no longer in therapy nor on medication and I haven't been since around late 2011/early 2012.
9591,Should I start to talk to a therapist?
9592,I've recently been seeing a therapist who said I wasn't a narccicist at all but at the other end of the spectrum.
9593,"It's hard to bring up mental illness in passing, and I figure social support is the strongest link I can add to my chain of soon-to-begin therapy."
9594,Since then he's been on medication and is still working on finding a therapist that will will work with his insurance.
9595,"I know I eventually need a therapist, but it feels pointless unless I move out."
9596,"I've been unable to speak with a therapist, so does anyone know of any exercises I can focus on to maybe alleviate some of my anxiety?"
9597,"I am seeing a new therapist some time next week when I set up an appointment tomorrow, but I'm struggling tonight.."
9598,"I still think I smell even though my parents, best friend, and therapists have told me I don't."
9599,I just started therapy again and will hopefully be on some meds soon.
9600,What if the medicine and therapy don't work?
9601,"I have to wait until Friday to see my therapist and psychiatrist again, but I only see them once a week I feel like I need to see them sooner and be put on meds asap because of school, I already missed two classes."
9602,"I started reading self help books, I saw a therapist, I did talk therapy, CBT, even virtual reality, nothing ever worked."
9603,"Early in 2014, Reid (a close friend of mine from back in London who also moved to New York) decided to take this exposure therapy treatment for his SA."
9604,"So, finally the day came, I didn't get much sleep the night before, but I met the Dr and we did what they call exposure therapy."
9605,I have been seeing a therapist and I am not sure if we are a good match.
9606,How do you successfully separate from a therapist without making them feel bad?
9607,"They take weeks to make an effect, and I never know if it is the drug or the therapy that gives me a small boost, because usually when I'm changing meds, I'm also seeing a therapist more often."
9608,Insurance companies in the past have really only paid for therapy appointments for me when I'm going through serious life crises (because insurance companies are cheap bastards).
9609,I also set up a therapy appointment for this Tuesday.
9610,"*edit* I am seeing a therapist regularly (just recently, my fourth session is coming up) I haven't talked to her about meds yet, this just popped into my head today


Thanks"
9611,"after looking up options for help, i stumbled upon the suggestion to get a therapy dog, and my whole body just kind of *settled* when i read that."
9612,"Well then I saw this thread on Reddit, and there was a therapist in there getting unfairly attacked by some others."
9613,That would defeat the whole purpose of the therapy/appointments.
9614,"I don't really know what I need help with, because she's going to the doctors and now hypnotherapy etc."
9615,Been in therapy for a year and a half now.
9616,"I should also say that therapy is virtually non-existent here, so I don't have a lot of options to speak to someone about my issues."
9617,I have asked him to come to marriage therapy on Thursday.
9618,Especially if he does not come to the therapy this week.
9619,"I'm also in therapy, but I recently switched over to group therapy and I still have a hard time bringing up things in a group setting."
9620,"I feel that exposure therapy would not be an option in this regard, given the nature of the intrusive thoughts."
9621,"I don't have health insurance (have to wait a few more days to open enrollment) so I'm going to do my best to hang in there, but i'm going to see a doctor and try to see a therapist as soon a I can."
9622,"So I can't get any medication until I have been to a therapist (on waiting list), so I decided to go down to my local pharmacist and ask for something natural for anxiety, she gave me rescue remedy spray and was wondering if anybody had any experience with anything like this and if it worked, something tells me I just wasted €8 but thought I would ask about it."
9623,During this I will be seeking out a therapist and maybe try to see a cardiologist to hopefully out my mind at ease that my heart is ok.
9624,"Slowly, thanks to the support of my boyfriend and a couple close friends and some therapy, I've been able to slowly work through my issues."
9625,"---


^(Note on therapy: I battled with this through my entire teenage years when my parents did not believe a therapist was necessary."
9626,I will have my own health insurance for the first time in my life this month and I DO plan to see a therapist.)
9627,I’m on medication off and on and I struggle to find a good therapist.
9628,"After having actual physical symptoms (shaking, mind racing, fireworks going off in my chest) I decided to go to therapy."
9629,"It's been about two years since I have met with a therapist, and I have been off medication (prozac) for about six months now."
9630,I need reassurance or therapy or something.
9631,Doctors and therapy were never any help.
9632,"I've had anxiety for a while now, and panic since last December, and it's been getting better with medication and therapy."
9633,I met my new therapist today.
9634,The therapist I met today said that next time we meet (Wednesday next week) she'll try to decide whether or not I've actually got OCD (and then later she'll have a look at the other disorders as well).
9635,We can't really afford to seek out a therapist for assistance so I turn to you Reddit.
9636,And that its just a fucked up part of my brain telling me these horrible things like that people don't love me and that my boyfriend is gonna leave me and that I can't finish school or succeed at my job or even utilize the help that I seek in therapy.
9637,I started college last year and decided to see a therapist to tackle my problem with anxiety with CBT and it was effective.
9638,"Hey everyone,
Going through some life changes recently, and I was wondering what motivated you, or when you realized that it was time to seek out some help (therapy wise)?"
9639,"(beware super wall of text commencing)

That said, I have some questions wondering if my anxiety is normal, I read the Wiki, took the little test (48 out of 100 but 35 raw score, mild to moderate anxiety), but mainly Im thinking a lot lately about old age, the consequences and dying and quick google searches said anxiety was the culprit, its normal, and seek medical therapy, figured /r/Anxiety seemed the natural place to post this."
9640,"I do see a therapist (and so does the friend I'm close to, she has issues with depression and such, and thats part of the reason we talk to each other so much)

I really don't know what to do"
9641,I am thinking about going to speech therapy..
9642,"So, (I see a therapist and do not take medication) I'm hoping that I can make a change in my life that will alleviate this anxiety."
9643,I should be starting therapy soon which I hope helps.
9644,My therapist says I have the mentality of a 9 year old as that was the age I was first violated and that's when I stopped emotionally growing.
9645,"It would be nice to have health insurance so I can see doctors and therapists, but the customer service aspect of Starbucks has me worried."
9646,"So do I take a job at Starbucks, constantly contemplate on killing myself, but have the insurance to go see doctors and therapists?"
9647,"I know there are cheap clinics out there, but I don't know how good of therapists and doctors they have."
9648,I should have received therapy from somewhere.
9649,I was put on some meds and have started a bit of therapy but have yet to get far.
9650,"Under supervision, trauma, and psychotherapy, I began to recover."
9651,"I'm wanting to try seeing a weekly therapist and going off my celexa, but I'm hesitant to do so because I'm not confident that therapy alone can heal me."
9652,"I see a therapist, I meditate, try to eat better and am on 1 dose of 10 mg of lexapro a day and 2 doses of 1mg ativan a day."
9653,"I called my therapist office and contemplated a hospital trip and my blood pressure had skyrocketed, I was terrified and lying in bed restless for about 48 hours."
9654,My therapist doesn't believe in benzo's and strongly recommends I stick only with meditation (which I do find helps) but I can't live like that again and I need the assist.
9655,"anyway onto my question , yes another one :-(   

So in my last therapy session I was asked how I felt about my progress so far, and if I was able to give my self credit for coming so far, and i was stumped i was not able to actually say the words, let alone think them."
9656,"EDIT:

So i talked this over in therapy today and explained this issue to my therapist, we came to the conclusion that the reason why i get no feelings yet from positive thoughts (yet)  is because i never really done it before, its also the reason why the only thought i can come up with at the moment is ""you're doing good""

now if theres where negative thoughts i could come up with tons of different things to say to myself and do so with unending venom."
9657,"I started seeing a therapist, who insisted that I had some deep seated trauma in my childhood causing my anxiety."
9658,"My therapist kept digging for something, and I kept wasting money and saw no progress."
9659,"I am thinking that I've had this anxiety my entire life, but I saw a therapist for how stressed I'd get as a child and learned how to manage my reactions to the things that was usually cause a breakdown (forgetting something I was told, disappointing my mother, bullies, grades)."
9660,"Hi,

I'd like to know what things people have tried out to treat their anxiety; whether that's:

* books (please list name of book(s) and author(s)
* therapy
* helpful advice (please list advice that helped beat anxiety)

If anyone has overcome anxiety, I'd love to hear what worked for you."
9661,I saw a therapist about a year into having these issues but only for the summer until I went back college.
9662,Fast forward through some medication changes and therapy and things get better.
9663,I also have a number of other mental health issues and I feel it's time to see a therapist again (last time I was in therapy was seven years ago when I was still a minor).
9664,"I live in a country with free health care, so paying for therapy is not the problem, but actually calling a therapists office is what I just can't do."
9665,I also called my therapist and left a message asking about any openings available before our next appointment (scheduled for next Thursday).
9666,"They are not therapists but they share what has worked for them...meditation, exercise, eating healthy, good nights sleep."
9667,I recently started therapy for my anxiety issues.
9668,"I'm trying to upgrade my high school courses (I'm 28, been out of high school for 10 years) to get into the respiratory therapy program at my local university."
9669,I'll be 33 (after I apply and hopefully gain entrance) when I start the respiratory therapy program.
9670,I've stopped school and I'm losing an entire year of my life going to therapy in which l am making progress.
9671,"So i’ve been dealing with anxiety/panic attacks for about 1,5 years now in the context of a particular exam at law school and started cognitive behavioral therapy three months ago because of it - and I made good progress so far."
9672,"However, I am still „not quite there yet“, and I haven’t told anyone of my friends about my problem (and my struggle with it) or the therapy, because of the stigma that sadly still comes with mental health issues."
9673,"**So my question is, do you talk to people (besides therapists and family/SOs) about anxiety and panic attacks and your struggle with it - and if so, how, and what were your experiences so far?"
9674,"**

Unrelated, but maybe helpful to some: What really helped me get better besides the cognitive behavioral therapy is Kickboxing."
9675,"I am not talking about exercising, exposure therapy, CBT, ""Keeping Busy"", Acupuncture, Massage Therapy...etc...etc..."
9676,If I have an interaction with my therapist or the place I volunteer I will replay it in my head over and over afterwards having the conversation again and again while pacing around.
9677,I started therapy six months ago.
9678,"My first session, my therapist told me to challenge my thoughts and decide whether they are realistic or just in my head."
9679,Hope I can keep this up until my next therapy session.
9680,"She said I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, but I'm seeing a therapist and a different doctor next week so they can assess me as well."
9681,I discussed this with my therapist this morning and she said she couldn't think of any and have to ask around.
9682,"Since then, I've been taking escitalopram for almost two months and I go to therapy regularly."
9683,I've read to start with a Psychiatrist to get diagnosed and be prescribed medicine if needed and then follow up with a Psychologist for longer term therapy.
9684,"I go to therapy, but I'm not sure if that's even helping."
9685,"Throughout the semester, I saw two therapists--one at my school's counseling center and another one in private practice."
9686,Since we both have disorders we are completely different and I have no clue how to help him until he can get a job to get on some proper medication or see a therapist.
9687,"I've gone to therapy and am on zoloft, but I still suffer from bouts of anxiety and obsession."
9688,These are the things that you will learn through therapy.
9689,It took me too many years to get into therapy and start to straighten all of this out.
9690,I'm glad I went through the therapy and started to gain control of my life.
9691,"So I'll be seeing my family doctor next week to see what he can do for me, and to see if he can't set me up with a therapist or someone who is covered by OHIP (Free health care in Canada, woot!)."
9692,I have started seeing a therapist as well but I'm not sure if it will help.
9693,"I start intensive therapy on Tuesday, and I'm scared."
9694,Can someone tell me what it's like in group therapy?
9695,"I went off of nights and onto 4pm-10pm, I got into my PcP who put me on physical therapy and went back to the psychiatrist."
9696,"**TL;DR I'm really REALLY anxious and not sure what drugs to use, therapy to seek, or lifestyle choices to make**

I'm addicted to computers."
9697,Does Skype therapy exist?
9698,"I have extreme anxiety and I've tried some brief exposure therapy to become better at talking to people, work also helped me improve."
9699,"I went to a therapist back then who prescribed me Lexapro but I stopped it because of the side effects and never went back to therapy until now, 6 years later."
9700,"As for treatment, I’m on Zoloft 75mg and in psychodynamic therapy."
9701,The therapist I am talking to doesn’t really seem to be making much of a positive impact.
9702,"I do attend a therapy and seen some improvement to my condition but it's still not ideal, far from it actually."
9703,"My therapist always suggests I feel that way because I have this fear of intimacy and commitment and, most of all, raised expectations."
9704,"I just turned 26 and don't have health insurance anymore, so I haven't seen my therapist in a couple months."
9705,"I've looked into CBT and I would much rather just go about my day with a kick in the butt from some meds than have to go to a therapist on a regular basis while I'm busy with work, school and planning for the future."
9706,"I've scheduled an appt with a therapist, but I think I need help confirming that my symptoms are in fact anxiety and not caused by something else."
9707,Ps my doc ant therapist know and I'm no risk.
9708,I've been struggling with anxiety my whole life but I am at my best now due to a really great therapist.
9709,"Sorry for the wall of text, I just feel like my progress in therapy means nothing since I have no job, friends, and am not excelling in school."
9710,"Anyways, I suffer from depression/anxiety/mild OCD which I have been medicated for and I'm currently in therapy as well."
9711,"I just dont talk to her about my mental health, my meds or my therapist appointments with her."
9712,"I’ve wanted to try therapy for a few years now but had no insurance to cover the expenses, despite being Canadian."
9713,"Now they've given me a choice between being in a 12-week group therapy session, or going one-on-one with a therapist for 8-15 weeks."
9714,"The drawback of the one-on-one therapy is that her trainee (therapist in training) HAS to be at every session, which I don't really like the idea of honestly."
9715,"Needless to say, I’m anxious about a one-on-one (two technically) anxiety therapy program."
9716,"I'm torn between the two therapy session choices, but my contact wants an answer by the end of the week."
9717,"I kind of signed up for the treatment with the assumption that I’d be one-on-one with a therapist, but during the interview I was told that most people are placed in the group therapies because there’s just so many people and so few available slots for one-on-one therapy."
9718,I began to warm up to the idea of group therapy given that everyone in the group will be people I relate to.
9719,This makes me lean toward group therapy.
9720,"But my contact said although both choices are good, and she thinks I’d do well in the group therapy too, apparently people improve faster in one-on-one sessions which are more personalized."
9721,"But the one-on-one sessions could start right away, whereas the group sessions would begin in May, and I’d probably be done with therapy by the time that time if I went with the one-on-one."
9722,"I've tried therapy, but it just didn't sit well with me."
9723,"I've considered looking into alternative therapies, thinking that my issue is some sort of PTSD."
9724,"Basically, over the years I've tried all kinds of medications and tried all kinds of therapy, CBT, hypnotherapy, etc, for depression and severe social anxiety/""AVPD"", and it never helped."
9725,"In the case of the therapy it was interesting, but ultimately it never actually improved my problems, and it is expensive."
9726,"I have recently been diagnosed with PTSD, and started exposure therapy."
9727,The exposure therapy currently has me writing out as much as I can remember about the rapes - which turns out isn't a lot.
9728,"But I'm not thinking about the rapes themselves, although that's what I focus on when I do my therapy/homework."
9729,"I would go to a therapist, but honestly I've tried, did nothing for me considering I knew what they were going to ask/what their response would be, so the only thing I find useful for myself is the fact that it's a chance to 'release' so to speak, but I can do it else where and not spend money."
9730,So I've been visiting a therapist for a month now to discuss my worsening anxiety problems.
9731,The one med that has worked is Adderall and I'm currently on 50mg per weekday as it completely erases all anxiety and depression (I have ADD along with GAD and mild depression) However I've discussed this with my doctor and therapist and we've decided to stop over the summer and find something that won't be so detrimental to my physical health like Adderall is.
9732,"(logically, i shouldn't be worried about that, because the ""high"" from ritalin is not pleasant)

I've still got a fortnight before I have to go back to work, but I'm starting to worry about how I'll explain to my new team that I didn't sit my exams (not the best first impression...)

My doctor also recommended that I see a therapist, to discuss my breakup, they provided me with details of a self-referral service."
9733,"I'm really not sure if it's something I want to do, the last therapist I spoke to vehemently told me that ADHD didn't exist when I was referred to him because I had concerns about distractability."
9734,"I've recently got in with a therapist, and she says it would be a good idea to stop smoking because it increases anxiety long term (while reducing it in the very short term when you smoke)."
9735,"I'm seeing a therapist soon, so I hope he/she will be able to help, but until then, I really hope I can get some advice from y'all."
9736,"In addition to putting me in touch with several cognitive behavioral therapists in my area, she started me on 25mg of sertraline a day."
9737,"I go see a therapist and a psychologist twice a week now, my cousin messed with my confidence and self-esteem so bad I have Social Anxiety Disorder."
9738,I can't go to therapy.
9739,"They recommended a benzodiazepam (either clonazepam once a day or lorazepam twice times a day) and that I try another SSRI, and that I go to therapy."
9740,"As the title states, I'm looking for a therapist."
9741,All I did to find several therapists was pretty simple; I just Googled anxiety therapists in my area.
9742,"Most therapists I looked at said that they used cognitive behavioral therapy, which I think I've heard is very good for anxiety."
9743,My search results brought up both psychologists and therapists.
9744,I would also like to know any important qualities that those who have seen therapists have looked for.
9745,"Unfortunately, using a visit to ""feel out"" a therapist counts against one of my eight insurance visits, so I'd like to find a good one on the first try if I can."
9746,What are some good things to bring up on the phone when calling therapists and asking them a few questions?
9747,"I saw a therapist once last year, recommended by my insurance when I called and got a list, but she clearly didn't specialize in anxiety and it was just a really flat experience with her."
9748,"I'm going to a therapist, who suggested that anxiety medicine will help supplement my therapy."
9749,"My boyfriend is from a country that views going to the therapist or taking any anxiety/depression medication as only someone ""crazy"" or ""weak"" will do (his words)."
9750,I just started therapy again 2 weeks ago.
9751,"I was going to the counselor in the free clinic at my university, but I don't go to that university anymore so now I have to go to a therapist in town and pay for it."
9752,Paying for therapy seems like it's stressing me out even more than just trying to deal with my mental problems on my own.
9753,How do you deal with paying for therapy and the financial worry?
9754,"He won't read any of the books on depression or anxiety I've gotten or the websites I've referred him to, he won't try any of the calming techniques on his own, and he's resistant to the idea of therapy."
9755,I have gone (and still go) to a therapist.
9756,"The app is called Pacifica (thinkpacifica.com) and it consists of daily activities rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy, wellness, and relaxation techniques."
9757,"He also said that he had seen a therapist a while back, but hadn't for a while."
9758,He said he's been continuing to have doubts and anxiety and that he's been seeing his therapist for almost a month at that point.
9759,"I'm making plans to go into therapy to sort out my own anxieties, but my heart hurts so much."
9760,I had started to see a therapist at my university's psych center and plan to continue in the fall.
9761,I know only my therapist would have the best idea whether meds (and which ones) would be a good choice and each individual's situation is unique.
9762,I am considering taking them along with my psych therapy for the fall and would like to know others' experience with them.
9763,"I got better at dealing with it after going to therapy for a year when I was 16, but it never went away completely."
9764,Scheduled a follow up appointment for a month from now and am looking into starting therapy again just to enhance my anxiety toolbox.
9765,"However, my anxious thoughts turn every little thing ($20) or more into an irrational: “Oh my GOD, how are we going to pay for this wedding…”  

The money irrationality bleeds over into other anxiety patterns about life, success, and just generally make me miserable sometimes..  of course I am working on these with healthy eating, meditation, and therapy."
9766,"I'm also going to see a therapist for the first time next Monday, and I was wondering if I should just bring this up to him instead."
9767,I started remembering some good tips I got from this sub and my therapist before the attack got worse.
9768,"""Well you just need confidence, it's nothing a little therapy couldn't help."
9769,Does she not understand that therapy is just talking about your feelings?
9770,"I've seen a therapist about this, I'm on a SSRI for anxiety/panic, I practice many relaxing techniques, but it doesn't really help sometimes."
9771,I saw a therapist last year for a few months but can no longer afford it.
9772,"I do have a new GP I like, and hopefully a new therapist/psychiatrist soon."
9773,I'm seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist.
9774,"""*, *""what if I've managed to convince myself and the psychologists/psychiatrists/therapists that I'm mentally ill when I'm actually not?"
9775,"I mostly seek reassurance on the internet because I don't really talk about my mental illness ""in real life"", except for with my therapist but that's not really working at the moment."
9776,"I don't want to start right with medicine, and I started therapy last week with my next appointment this coming Monday."
