2) Experience periods of mania where I'm initially very talkative, happy, euphoric, grandiose but experience the crash where I feel very quiet, withdrawn, fucking hell, get away from me, dear goodness if you try to text me I'm going to blow a gasket

2) I rarely talk or socialize with anyone (not even my family) 

3) I hate everything

4) I always feel on edge

5) I have trouble concentrating on a task



When I'm not on the medication:

1) I have this ""get away from me"" vibe 

2) I don't enjoy anything 

3) I can't stay on task 

4) I have this feeling in my mind as though I'm always distracted

5) I can never achieve a ""flow"" state

6) I have shitty verbal communication (as in, I can't communicate)

7) I feel anhedonic

8) People have told me that I seem ""flat"", ""stagnant"", ""boring"", ""non-animated"", ""not myself""

9) I FEEL flat

10) Lazy, low energy, unmotivated

11) Poor metabolism





Social consequences:


1) I have trouble settling in anywhere

2) I sabotage my performance at work if I know I'm not going to fit in there or the time I'm going to spend there is finite
