I'll start by saying I'm 34 with 2 beautiful daughters. They've helped me more than anytning.  I've had several failed marriages. They ended either from them cheating or abuse. I always tried the best I could and it was never good enough. I'm not very social. My anxiety creates facades that no one likes me or judging me. The relationship I'm in now has created a few anxiety problems for me once again. With everything I've been through I keep worrying about us too. Whether he's happy and if he'll stay. If he wants to marry me even down to if he likes my kids or cooking. I don't know how to explain it. I just know I'm tired of living with the burden of constant worry. I've tried medications but they only made me feel like a zombie and going to sit down with a therapist only increases my anxiety. The thought sucks. I don't know what to do but the constant checking on my boyfriend with worry hell be like the rest or looking for problems when there isn't any is driving me crazy.

I've been through my share of doctors, therapy, emergency room visits, diagnoses, breakdowns, etc. I was severely crippled by my anxiety and depression throughout my college career. I finally received my degree but I'm paying for my past mistakes. 

I finally found a psychiatrist who realizes how my bad my anxiety and OCD is and he prescribed me ativan (0.5mg, as needed). I'm supposed to take 1 tablet every 12 hours (as needed). I'm against taking medication after what I had to deal with in the past but I realized this is my only option to get better.

However, I feel like it's not really helping me. I'm going through a really tough time in my life right now and I've been crying almost everyday. I can't deal with this along with the shaking, grinding my teeth, repetitive thoughts, you name it. I'm getting so sick of being like this. Anyone who meets me can sense my anxiety. I'm a damn mess and I don't know how to fix myself.

I always have that sense of impending doom. I hyperventilate a lot. When I get really bad I experience hypervigilance after. The nightmares come and go, but I always have trouble sleeping. 

I don't know where I'm going with this. I guess I'm progressively getting worse again and I don't know what to do. I have no friends. I have no job. I have nothing going for me after years of battling mental illness. I'm still broken and I don't know what to do next. I see my doctor next week and I don't know what to tell him about these meds. He tried going me SSRIs before the ativan, but I had REALLY bad side effects within the first week and had to stop.

What the hell do I do now? Thank you for reading this. :("

I've been really trying to focus on getting off of any anti-anxiety medication and overcoming/dealing with this in a more natural way and I really think I've had a lot of success.  Today I woke and realized that the last few days I haven't had to be thinking of ways to deal with panic and anxiety - *because I've been feeling much better!*  ...This thought somehow made me more anxious.  It's like part of me is afraid to let go of this anxiety - I've known it all my life and it's such a different way to think that somehow it felt unnatural and therefore wrong.  How do I break out of this?  I feel like this is one of the key pieces to really being able to let this go.  It's just such a strange sensation... and I'm not sure many people without anxiety would understand the feeling.  Hell I don't even understand it."

Right now I'm 15. My sister died of a long battle with cancer when I was 12. I didn't really like going to therapy, I felt it didn't help me. About 6 months ago, my parents told me they're getting a divorce, and that's made every single family situation awkward. I hardly see my dad much anymore.

Recently, I've been getting horrible anxiety attacks. Most happen in school. It'll start with a back pain, or a headache, and work it's way into `oh fuck now i have cancer i'm going to die`.  It's interfering with my schoolwork, too. I'll get attacks in most of my classes, and it's a battle to stay focused until I can get up and leave and just walk around to calm down. Sometimes I shake so bad in my seat, people will start to look at me.

I don't usually eat, sometimes I go a day without eating at all. And most of the time when I do eat, I get really nauseous. Bright lights also bother me now for some reason.

I've been going to another therapist I kind of like, I've gone twice. Though, it isn't really helping. I honestly think the only thing left that would help me is some sort of medication. I've talked to my mom about it and she says that I probably don't need it and if I do, the therapist will prescribe some to me.

How can I make it clear to whoever can actually give me them that I want to try medication? Do I even need it?"

Recently my husband and I have been struggling with bills, getting school stuff together and saving to move out of the south soon along with that has come a new anxiety. I have been worried if I am happy enough in life, am I depressed, will I be one day, what if one day I kill myself at some point in life, something I hate the thought of. My husband (who has mild depression) says I am not depressed because I always want to go and do and can't stand laying about the house, and I am never sad until I think about these worries. I can't afford a consular right now or medication. So my question is do other people have this sort of anxiety because I haven't seen any post similar to this, and it would just comfort me to know others feel the same. I just can't tell if I am making a normal small worry huge or if I am truly becoming extremely unhappy, its hard to find reality in anxiety sometimes.

It just has not worked out for us yet.) I have a friend whose children are a bit out of control. The last time I watched them the two year old split her head open because she jumped off a box while I walked to the kitchen to get the older child (5 - boy) a glass of water. While trying to assess the situation the older child kept demanding that I take care of his needs (wanting a glass of water) with no regard to his sister at all. I called my friend to let her know what was happening, but instead of coming right home she stopped to have dinner with her husband making her hours later than she told me she would be back in the first place. This also ruined my weekend plans as I was planning on leaving town that night but that is a different story all together. I do have extreme social anxiety to begin with (which is part of the reason I find it near impossible to say no) I have also felt guilty babysitting for other friends in fear that it will get back to her. I know that most of my anxiety is irrational but I feel that in this one instance it is justified anxiety. I do not want to hurt her feelings, and especially as a non parent come off as judgmental of her children or her parenting. This last time she asked I explained that I was getting my anxiety medicine adjusted a few days before she needed me to watch them and maybe it would be easier for me. Honestly, I thought she would tell me not to worry about it and to just feel better and let her know if I am up to it anytime in the future. Of coarse that is not how it worked out.

I first went it wanting to treat my anxiety which has plagued me for a while but only recently got worse, and he prescribed me some meds. Since then each med I've tried has given me some side effect and when I go to talk to him he gives me another to try.

After about the fifth med he said lets just throw that all out and go for psychotherapy. Problem being, the area I'm in is extremely underserved for psychiatrists and therapists and I have to go with a hospital group that has pay on a sliding scale for uninsured/poor people, and the only one anywhere close is apparently booked for two months.

I've put thought into it, and I still want to attempt to treat it my anxiety with medication, if the option is still viable.

My question is: should I wait until a psychiatrist becomes available, two months from now and go talk to them? Or should I go back to the doctor and tell him I want to keep trying medication? Or, perhaps, should I try and find a different doctor in the area and get a second opinion?


The medications I've tried are

Fluoxetine: Horrible nausea: lasted all day and interrupted work. Though were I not working I might've been able to put up with it for a while.

Buspirone: Caused me increased heart rate and anxiety, headache and light headedness, though only once I moved up to 15 mg after starting out on a lower dose and gradually moving up.

Trazodone: Started at half a pill, moved up to full pill after a week. Caused me panic attacks right before bed.

Paroxetine: I don't actually remember why I stopped this one. Might've also been nausea, but I can't recall.

Cymbalta: Awful nausea and extreme drowsiness. Basically slept for two and a half days after one pill.


I'm currently taking clonazepam whenever I have a panic attack and just going about my daily life. But I'd really like to feel like I'm at least taking steps towards improving my life."

Hey guys, I'm a victim of hereditary anxiety. I'm guessing the right term would be GAD because I have no reason to be anxious, life is going dandy for me. Nothing great, but nothing bad at all with it. And I was/am chronically anxious, every single day. One day it would be the shaky nervous anxiety, the next it would be the ""I'm about to throw up/diarrhea"" anxiety, and then the next would be the ""Where am I, why are the walls moving, am I in a dream?"" anxiety.

&gt;Anyway, I only took clonazepam because my mom had it on hand once when I was having a really bad attack and near forced me to take it. I was worried it would make me feel even worse. To my surprise, it worked. With no side effect other than feeling sedated a little bit. Now I know that clonazepam is not something you take everyday ( I mean you can.. ) but it's something more for emergencies/situational use. Plus I knew I was building a tolerance fast. Only after 5-6 dosages of 0.25mg's, what used to make me feel sedated and crash out now doesn't even affect me. So I had to get onto a maintenance pill. 

&gt;Paxil was my doctor's first choice. I don't know how many mg's the pill was but I took half before bed. I fell asleep, and within an hour I woke up like I was on crack. (I've never used before, I'm just assuming.) My whole body was one giant tremor, I stumbled to my parents room because I thought something insane was happening. They calmed me down and let met sleep on their floor in case I had more trouble. I just remember being eyes wide open and my mind just racing. I tried very hard to fall asleep, I closed my eyes and in what felt like a blink 1am turned into 6am and I was wide awake. I did not feel groggy, I didn't feel like I slept at all. The next day was spent not being able to close my eye lids for more than a couple seconds and constantly shaking a limb. Mentally, this medication made me feel like a zombie. I couldn't be depressed/anxious because I couldn't focus on what was making me sad at the time. In fact I couldn't think about anything for more than 2 seconds without my mind switching to some other topic. I couldn't be sad, but I couldn't be happy either.

This all was when I was about 17. Today I'm 20, near 21, and my anxiety has come back full force. But in a different way. Over the years I've noticed myself being sluggish, feeling like my brain wasn't on or something was wrong with me. But I didn't associate those feelings with anxiety since the only anxiety attacks I've had were panic attacks. Feeling nervous and shakey. Now my anxiety attacks are mellow but not in a better way. Everyday for a couple weeks I spent in bed feeling ill to my stomach. I was very dizzy and lightheaded, and confused at times. I had this feeling that you get right before you're about to puke and you want your mommy and daddy. The feeling that didn't know that paper was due or that the final was today. Constantly scared, but for no reason. I've been a vegetable in my bed for the passed few weeks. I never registered for classes next semester, because I couldn't even fathom going to class in the state that I'm in. And I've been avoiding going to work a lot. (I have a very tolerant and flexible boss and little financial responsibility at the moment, thankfully)

So I went back to the doctor, said I'm not having that Paxil experience again. He prescribes me Buspar. Many hate it or don't care for it, and little love it with a passion. It has many reviews, and they are so mixed. Some people it made nervous and even more anxious, some people said it made them pass out into a pool of their own drool, some say they hallucinated. But whether people said they hated it because of bad reactions, it did nothing for them and they think it's a sugar pill, or it was a miracle drug that turned their life around, they all had one thing in common. It made them incredibly dizzy. I absolutely did not want this, dizziness to me is like being on a roller coaster you can't get off of. And if I was dizzy, for sure I would be nauseous.

&gt; So, being so traumatized by Paxil and not wanting to be dizzy, I literally took a chip off the end of the 5mg pill(The lowest dosage it comes in and I only took half of a half, of a half) and tried to keep my mind off the potential side effects. I was on my phone when I noticed it sort of ""hit"". The phone's colors were a little more vibrant and exaggerated and everything just felt a little odd. Nothing enough to make me freak out yet. I then began yawning over and over for a good 5 minutes and felt like taking a nap, so I did. I woke up from this nap incredibly energized almost like I was on Paxil. But it didn't make me freak out like Paxil did, I just felt like I drank a ton of coffee and I could run 10 miles. My jaw was a little sore though, I think I was grinding my teeth while I was sleeping which has never happened. And while I was awake I caught myself chewing the inside of my cheek or my tongue quite a few times. But the anxiety and dizziness/confusion was gone. I thought to myself, this drug isn't addictive, it's very cheap and if I can build up a tolerance to where I'm not being shocked by overwhelming energy, then I'll definitely enjoy life again while on it.

&gt;This feeling lasted all the way until night time, but wore off a little. I actually had no trouble going to sleep though. The next day I was still feeling it (I know it has a short half life, but I've never had energy like this, I wan't to believe it was this med) and being at a lower level of unnecessary energy, I was feeling actually really good. No more confusion, no more dizziness, I felt almost euphoric. Grin from ear to ear. I thought to myself, ""Is this how normal people feel? Have I just been mentally suppressed my whole life?"" I did have a moment of sadness though, because I thought for a second about how this may not last. How tomorrow I may feel just as bad as I felt a couple days ago. I did not take a pill that day, because I still had a lot of energy from taking the crumb of the pill the day before. Needless to say, I was back to square one the day after. I took the crumb again, and the anxiety went away, I got really happy again and motivated, but the power rush didn't come back. It did give me energy, but not overpowering how it was before. Like mentioned above, I was in my happy place. The day after that is today. I took another crumb, a little bigger this time. And felt happy and motivated with no anxiety. Although this time within 7-8 hours the anxiety was coming back, where as it lasted 2 days the first time, and all day the second time.

Now I have an issue.. It's depressing me a lot to think that for me to be happy in life, that I'm going to have to take this pill every single day. That I'm not the reason that I'm happy, it's these pills. I'm not truly happy, it's just artificial. It's not fixing my unbalanced chemicals, it's synthetically boosting me and it's not natural to feel this euphoric. What if I forget my pills on a trip one day? Why can't I be happy.. by myself? These are questions that are sort of putting me down."

From an early age I have been able to voluntarily cause an electrical shock sensation in my head, I told my parents but they didn't believe me and it turned into something I just kept to myself and didn't talk about. Though recently I heard that some people on anti-depressant medication experience a similar symptom.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome#Neurological

&gt; Symptoms described as ""brain zaps,"" ""brain shocks,"" ""brain shivers,"" ""brain pulse-waves,"" ""head shocks,"" ""pulses,"" ""flickers,"" or ""cranial zings"" are common withdrawal symptoms

&gt; Electric shock sensations have also been reported[24][25] with many patients describing the symptoms as ""brain zaps"". It has been suggested the sensations may represent an alteration of neuronal activity in the central nervous system.

This is roughly where I experience the electrical sensation.

It is underneath the skull and I can make it last a second, it wears down after a few shocks, I very rarely bother doing this, though I did it just now in order to make that picture. Very occasionally I can feel a shock coming on its own and it is stronger than the others, I can suppress it at will as well.

Has anyone ever had a similar experience? I am by no means an expert so I'm not jumping to conclusions, I think it may be related to a low amount of serotonin receptors which may also be related to ADHD."

Now, it is just more present... constant obsessing/symptom checking (it is part pure ocd... im always thinking ""am i feeling anxious? will i be anxious?"") and then subsequent panic attacks follow. I feel like I'm willing it to happen.. is that strange? I don't know what comes first.. the physical symptoms or the obsessive thoughts. Either way, it's exhausting and it is AROUND THE CLOCK.

I'm sure most of you know the feeling.... that it consumes your entire life. It happens everywhere. I could be a party, I'm constantly thinking of it.. trying to combat it... or at work.. at the gym... sitting watching a movie with my husband... It is taking the joy out of life. I want to experience and ENJOY and I really yearn for the years when it was never an issue.

I was on an SSRI (Celexa) for about 1 year. While it helped greatly, it made me gain a lot of weight and I am just a more natural remedy kind of girl. I went off of it.. slowly and successfully.. with no real attacks for  12 months... until now. Once an attack really hits, the loop begins....

I guess after all this rambling.. my question is, can it really get better without meds? NOTE: I have tried CBT multiple times... and it just wasn't a huge game changer for me.

 I'm trying to get pregnant and the last thing  I want to do is try to rely on a medication (though there are times like tonight where I just want to throw my hands up and say OK fine I will just take it).. who knows what it actually does to your brain. I have been working hard at mindfulness, and reading books like ""the power of now"" and ""You are not your brain"" by Dr. Schultz which have been helpful... but when im in the midst of an attack, the last thing I want to do is try to go through all these positive affirmations. I hate the sense of dread and the physical symptoms that go along w/ it. 

I do believe (or maybe want to believe) in being able to rewire your brain and telling yourself that you aren't your thoughts.. but I'd love to hear success stories. It is really making me down and the only thing that works right now is red wine (literally a few sips and the calm is amazing.. all ocd and anxiety gone.. obv parasympathetic system). and I know that's going down a bad path (esp if I ever get pregnant).

I got out of a therapeutic boarding school when I was 18, did a few semesters at community college.  After years of depression, things were looking up.  I had a highschool diploma, almost all of my GenEds out of the way, and a job.  Moved out of state to go to a new school, and didn't do well the first semester because some new problems start to crop up.  I start getting anxious, avoiding my classes, avoiding my professors, generally running away from help.  The anxiety is only heightened by the lengths I go to in order not to confront it.  I start having paranoid delusions that I'm being followed.  Pretty frequent panic attacks follow.  

Dad, who's paying my tuition at the moment (which I'm SO grateful for, I'm unbelievably lucky to be in such a situation where I don't have to be in college and concurrently worry about paying for college), sees my grades drop to shit and puts on the pressure.  If I don't make all A's or at least very close, he will stop supporting me financially in terms of tuition.

Now I'm in my second semester here, I'm getting a handle on the delusions and panic attacks with a lot of help, and now my anxiety is starting to manifest in insomnia as well.  I'll stay up for a couple days and then sleep for most of a day, and repeat.  I'm missing a lot of my classes and work.  I've gotten myself on some meds for this, and I'm trying.  God knows I'm trying.  But I just keep slipping up, and I feel like these few weeks are really crucial in deciding how things are about to go for me, but I also feel like I've lost all control in influencing that decision.

This is really, really frustrating.  I feel totally helpless and that scares me a lot.  Part of me tells me that it's all in my power to make this right.  Part of me tells me that I can't make everything alright right this instant but I can make some effort, and I can ask for help.  Most of me is just freaking out, though, and thinks that I can't do anything helpful to myself at all.

I just want to be okay with trying, without worrying about the results so much.

I just got prescribed new meds Lexapro and lorazepam. I already know the shit side effects Lexapro can cause with sex, so I was thinking about disregarding it completely. I think I would be way more anxious/depressed if I couldn't get off with my boyfriend. Is there anyone at all out there that DIDN'T have anorgasmia/sex issues on Lexapro? 

Lorazepam - never had experience with this and would like to know more. My grandfather was appalled they prescribed it for me because at one point all of his friends (prescribed for sleep too) got addicted.

But when you're in the middle of a panic attack, when there is nonstop terror and nothing else in the world seems to matter or exist and you're fairly certain you may die, how effective is Lora? My doc said it was faster and stronger than the 0.5mg Xanax I've been using for emergencies. This 0.5mg Lorazepam was prescribed to me to use daily at night but I would like this as my emergency med. 

Advice is appreciated. Thanks reddit! :)"

I went over to my male companion's apartment to watch fireworks and things between us just felt weird. We haven't been dating long and we're certainly not serious, but the weird feeling got to me.

Monday, I went back to the lab I work in after being off and my professor is pressing me to get my paper published. Stressor 1. I also recently found out my first deadline for applying to medical school is August instead of October. Stressor 2. When I asked my professor if he can write me a recommendation letter and review my personal statement, he asks for my deadline and I reply August. He says that he would normally want TWO MONTHS for revisions. But just get all my materials to him ASAP. Stressor 3. After all this and being on the verge of a panic attack for 2+ hours, I have to go around and ask other professors for recommendation letters. Stressor 4.

Needless to say, the last couple days I have been really high strung. In the back of my head, I am sure male companion is tired of me and doesn't want to see me anymore. I know that's not true, but that doesn't matter. He's leaving town this week and when I asked if I would get to see him before he left he replied, ""If you want to."" IN my brain that meant I was twisting his arm behind his back to get him to see me, that it was a chore to spend time with me. Then I get back to my apartment and get an email from my professor after he read my personal statement. He started out saying it was readable and entertaining. But then he goes onto say that it doesn't really get to the heart of why I want to go into medicine and then questions why I want to be a doctor. Cue downward spiral of negativity and self-loathing. Not to mention poor male companion has been trying to text me and tease me to lighten my mood, but I am so not in a good place right now and I am not going to unleash the full crazy on him. And it's the SUMMER for christ's sake. I should not be this stressed out.

TL;DR - I'm stressed please give me internet hugs."
20,0.9971357177750377,0.002864282224944954,0.097,0.753,0.15,"Two years ago I started seeing a psychiatrist because of panic attacks.  They started when I turned 30.  The first doctor that I saw gave me Klonopin as well as a few other drugs.  A few months later I moved and found another doctor.  That doctor did the same.  My doctor gave me Klonopin and other drugs for 2 years.

Last week I had a discussion with doctor about marijuana.  She told me that I had THC in my drug screen.  I reminded her that we had talked about marijuana multiple times within the past few years and that I was happy it actually made me feel good.  

Well, the doctor didn't remember any of those conversations (even though they were all in my medical records that she typed herself) and began to scold me for using what she called, ""the joint"".

She then went on to tell me that I do not have anxiety or any type of panic disorder.  Instead she said that every symptom I've ever discussed with her was because of marijuana and that she would no longer give me any medication.

I was dumbfounded, I didn't know what to do.  I smoke marijuana, it makes me feel a lot better when I'm tense, when I have headaches, when I have chest pain, etc, etc.  I don't smoke it very often but it's nice to have around when I want to ensure I have a relaxing evening.

Regardless of that, I'm now someone who has taken 3mg of Klonopin a day for two years and has been forced to stop taking it cold turkey.  I am afraid of the withdrawal side effects which has made my anxiety much worse.  I'm going to do my best to find another doctor but I'm afraid that I'm going to look like a shopper and they are going to deny helping me.

What can I do?

Also, do I have a leg to stand on in regards to marijuana making someone with anxiety feel better?  I know it makes me feel better and I've seen people here discuss how it made them feel better but is there any medical documentation anywhere discussing this?  I've seen medical studies that showed marijuana increased anxiety for some patients.  I understand that.  I've smoked too much pot before and it made me feel pretty shitty.  However, it never made me feel like I feel when I have a panic attack.  

I don't know where to start with this thing and any advice would be greatly appreciated.  "
21,0.8671089395016538,0.1328910604983792,0.138,0.743,0.118,"I'll make a long story short. 

I have Pure O and generalized anxiety.

From 2005-2007 I dated a girl who was my first love.  We started college together.  But we broke up in 2007 because she thought we were fighting too much.  (I honestly can't remember in retrospect).  I was heartbroken, though, and I never remember being that happy in my life since then.  She started dating and went on to marry one of my best friends.  I don't have contact with her or him anymore.

We broke up in January and I was devastated.  In October of that year (2007) I started dating someone else after having lost about 60 lbs.  We got engaged the following summer.  The idea that I was still in rebound never hit me, but we grew apart as she wanted to party and I had quit drinking.  

I was single for the next two years and then I started dating my most recent ex.  She has severe anxiety issues, a history of drug abuse, etc.  She was a wonderful person.  But we, with our anxiety and problems, ended up being emotionally abusive to one another.  It got to where I felt I couldn't get out and had to involve an outside party and the police.  I developed stress-induced hypothyroidism as a result and I took about 6 or 7 months to recover from that (my weight had gone up about 80 lbs since my initial loss so I got up close to 290).  

I took time off from school and work after the relationship ended and my parents were a big help to me as I got my thyroid meds in order and started losing weight.  I've lost 50 lbs since the middle of this past December.  

I went on a first date with a girl I met from Match.com last night.  It was amazing.  I felt like I was with my high school girlfriend all over again.  We talked for seven hours.  She normally goes to bed at 9.  She stayed up til 2 and we just talked to one another and it was awesome.  I gave her a hug and we talked about going out again after she gets back from a trip she is taking this week (she leaves tomorrow).  

She texted me good morning today and told me that even though she was gonna be busy she wanted to just say ""have a good day :).""  I texted her back later and told her I was gonna be at a local coffeehouse if she wanted to stop on her way out of town and grab a cup with me in the morning.  She didn't text back for about 5 hours and I sent another that just said, ""If not its not a big deal, just figured since I would be in the area I would ask :) and how did packing go?"" or something along those lines.  She texted me back later telling me sorry she had been busy and was now at the concert she had planned on going to with her mom, etc and that she ""definitely would like to"" get coffee but she ""didn't think she'd have time :("" in the morning.

She stayed out super late talking to me and we couldn't stop laughing and being goofy with each other all night, and I haven't had that much fun with girl since almost 10 years.  Today, I just couldn't stop obsessing about it.  Thinking how I had fucked things up somehow or that I was being an idiot or that something terrible was going to happen.  

And then it hit me today that I hadn't even been in love since that first girlfriend.  That I just wanted someone to be with or accept me and that the girls I was confiding were just getting more and more damaged and broken [not that there's anything wrong with them].  And then here I am today, having lost 50 lbs, out of an abusive relationship for almost a year, and I am absolutely fucking terrified I'm going to destroy it.

I can't focus on exercise or my little schoolwork I have left or just take my mind off of it because I finally have something like I used to have and I'm scared its all going to end.  I just want it to be okay and I just want to not worry about it.  

End rant.

My night job is only like a mile away from my house so i just walk to it however my morning job is about 20 minutes away from my house on a car so i depend on people to take me there because the craziness inside my head doesn't let me drive. Just thinking about driving gives me a panic attack when i try driving i just start shaking uncontrollably and i hate it because i hate depending off other people. now my ride's work schedule has changed so he can no longer give me rides to that job.

I have xanax from a friend so I was taking quarter of a bar when I woke up in the morning before work and I had a small hour long window where I was a little sleepy and loopy and then I was fine for the rest of the day. I wake up 2 hours before I go to work to get ready and the xanax times perfect so I'm not feeling like that right as I'm leaving for work. My doc said she doesn't want me driving within the first 4 hours of taking the klonopin because it will make me drowsy. Would you guys recommend taking it before bed at night and see how it carries over the next day? Or should I set my alarm an extra 2 hours before I usually wake up to take it and then go back to bed? I'm sure I'll have to try a few things out and see how I'll feel but I could use advice on how you guys time everything with your meds so you're not feeling like a dopy mess at the wrong time.

24,0.0020083179865537006,0.9979916820134428,0.091,0.818,0.092,"Hi guys, 

I've had an acute (but severe) anxiety disorder for about 15 years now (I'm 30). I have been with my partner (who's also 30) for for 12 years and married for 7. 

My disorder is really only an issue going into new workplace environments, however these attacks are incredibly severe, almost to the point debilitation. This is due to some very traumatic experiences I had entering the workplace as a teenager. 

On the plus side, during these past 12 years I have overcome my anxiety and successfully held down a couple jobs for some significant periods of time. 

On the negative side, due to the severity of this disorder I have also let some of other jobs go as I was simply unable to cope with it. Overall I think my disorder has cost me 5 or 6 jobs.

Up until recently my wife has always been a never-ending source or strength, love &amp; support for me. However a couple of years ago I had a particularly bad attack when I was about to start working a new full-time job. Long story short, I ended up not getting this job (because of my anxiety) &amp; my wife not long after had a nervous breakdown. She has always been the main income earner in our relationship and after not being able to keep a good-paying full-time job it all became a bit too much for her. In her words, she broke. As she explained to me not long afterwards she is desperate for me have to a consistent income. She was then put on some pretty strong medication.

Fast forward to this year and things have slowly grown more distant between us. I have started working what is essentially my dream job however it is only between 15-20 per week and the pay isn't that great. So, I went out to find another casual job to help bring in that little extra. Sadly, when I got this other job I yet again had extreme anxiety for a few days. It was at this point my wife gave me an ultimatum that I needed to make this job work or our marriage maybe over. 

As I'm sure most of you will understand having that added pressure hanging over me made the task of starting this new job made it that much more difficult. But, after a few days I did overcame my anxiety and am now currently work 2 jobs and bringing in a relatively regular income.

I was so proud of this achievement and thought that this might be the start of a turning point for us.  

However after a long and difficult discussion last night my wife confessed that while she is happy about me overcoming my anxiety and sticking with this job she no longer feels she has anything more to give me in terms of support and patience when it come to dealing with my disorder. On top of that due to my sporadic incomes over the past 12 years she does not ever see us being able to have children and on top of that she feels a big part of her breakdown &amp; subsequently being on medication is because of me and the trauma she's experienced watching &amp; having to constantly support me having such horrible panic attacks. She told me that whenever she thinks of a future with me, she is now filled with sadness &amp; insecurity.

We do both still love each other intensely but I just don't think she  can see a positive future with someone like me. She is making an appointment to see a psychologist today in the hope of helping her clarify her thoughts and then we will go from there. She has also suggested that we may need to separate temporarily for now, while she gets herself together in this way. Which I said I was willing to do.

So that's it basically. I am absolutely terrified by the thought of losing my wife, to the point where it makes me physically sick. I cannot imagine my life without her but her happiness trumps all of that and maybe we would be both better off in the long run to go our separate ways permanently if she cannot overcome how she feels about a future together with me. I'm doing everything I possibly can make things better but right now it just doesn't seem like enough and I don't know what to do.

That's it, any feedback or advise is of course appreciated. Thank you for reading this."

Depression has always been a part of my life, but it wasn't until I started college that anxiety surfaced. I had what I guess was pure-ocd. I got really bad attacks because I thought I had contracted horrible diseases, and then once I'd learned to control that, I got attacks because I thought I was somehow gay without my knowing.

I learned to control that too I guess. But then a year or two later, around two years ago, I started getting pretty bad general anxiety. I started getting what I guess is agoraphobia, I'd get really panicky if I felt I couldn't easily escape from somewhere, even just hanging out with friends.

This culminated with a really bad panic attack when I went out of town by myself. Long story short, it convinced me to seek professional help and I started antidepressants.

In January of this year I stopped taking them. I don't know why, really. I guess I'd started to feel too comfortable on them, started to take how I felt for granted. Depression came back hard, but also the anxiety, which I've always had more trouble dealing with.

I'm lonely, I've always been lonely. Today I saw this girl I fancy probably for the last time. I couldn't make a move. And I'm losing sleep over it.

I've been having a lot of anxiety about how I've wasted my youth. I'm 24 and I have nothing to show for it. No degree, no social life, nothing. It's been keeping me up at night. I'm planning to spend the next 4 years getting a degree, but now I've started getting anxiety about that. I'm going to be almost 30 when I graduate. Christ.

The health anxiety has been coming back too. A few years ago I learned I have mild Tourette's. It waxes and wanes but it causes me some anxiety, like I'm afraid it'll get worse one day and I'll be full blown like the people in those shows. Swearing uncontrollably. Anyway I saw a movie earlier and I think another person in the theatre had Tourette's, they were coughing and clearing their throat through the whole movie, and it got me thinking about my tics, and then the cycle started and I was pretty anxious through the whole movie.

I'm back on my meds now, but a lower dose. I'm hopeful that the anxiety will subside, but holy fuck. It's brought me nearly to tears. Something I'd hoped was behind me for good."

My partner is out of town for the week and doesn't even know whats going on because he doesn't have access to internet or phone until after 8. I feel like I'm all alone right now with no one to comfort me. All of my friends and family live hours away and aren't here to support me. Does anyone else crave company when they're having an anxiety attack creeping up? I like being around others as support and a distraction. It makes it easier to keep those negative thoughts at bay. I just keep obsessing and worrying what if it's something serious? My mind is racing and jumping to all of these ideas, each one worse than the one before. Being around people or having a distraction helps me ignore those intrusive thoughts. Anyway, I guess I'm rambling now. Sorry."

I can't say that it was for a good reason because this is what it has lead to, I was going to tell her the truth but it was all high school drama that I had lied about and now I am in college (3rd year). I just wanted to leave all that stuff behind me. She cried so much last night because she's been in a similar situation where she's been lied to. I just want to run so badly. I'm not good for her. But she wouldn't break up with me. I think I might be doing it today. She doesn't deserve to be yanked around by me. I've been so sick from a disease I've had and the disease gets worse through stress. Because of my depression and anxiety its gotten to an all time worst and I am basically constantly sick and a big root of the problem is my relationship with this girl. 

I have withdrawn from the first semester of school and I will be living at home to work on myself. I have to figure out what I want in life and I need to talk to a therapist. I turn to weed often when I'm feeling down which masks it for a bit. But I just feel like the biggest scumbag in the world. I am going to try to get better. I am going to be the best damn person I can be when I figure everything out. 

The attacks are bad. The depression is bad. Everything is bad. Ive had around 3 attacks in the last 24 hours that leave me crippled and I am on no medication. 

I have to work on not lying when I'm scared. I do it to protect myself and make myself look better and its just a terrible habit that only brings me trouble. I want it all to stop. I promise I will stop it. 

If anyone wants to talk or share anything (like thoughts) I'd love to hear it. The community sounds really nice and I just found it after 2 years of having anxiety. Thanks for reading too. It means a lot in this time.

I've been having issues for about 5 years have been taking medication for 3.  I take paxil (40mg/night) doxepin (20mg/night) and xanax (.5 x2 /day) and my anxiety is under control.

So recently I've been thinking about seeing a therapist to see if I can approach the issue from a different direction.  I'm not sure what I hope to achieve by seeing one; I have no problem with taking medicine, but I feel like I have nothing to lose.  

For those that see/have seen a therapist:  
What kind of realistic expectations should I have going in to therapy?  
Is it normal to start therapy without having a goal?

I've never sleepwalked before or witnessed anyone else doing it before, so I'm not sure of its basis.

I was on Lexapro and then changed to Celexa due to sexual side effects (severely delayed or absent ejaculation). Even with Celexa libido disappeared, so I was switched to Wellbutrin (with Zolpidem added for insomnia).

With Wellbutrin, I definitely started feeling less depressed (and more sexually fulfilled), but still suffered from anxiety. Not to say I am constantly anxious, but I have my moments that make it hard for me to calm down and not obsess.

After talking to my doctor, she recommended that I stay on Wellbutrin but ADD Prozac on top of it.

Since Prozac is an SSRI like Celexa and Lexapro, I am worried (as usual) that my sexual side effects (that I hated) might come back. I also have read that this combo can cause seizures.

So I open these questions up to those that are currently on both meds (Wellbutrin and Prozac) or have been.

Did sexual side effects increase or decrease?

How did your energy level change?

Did your weight fluctuate?

Did anxiety diminish?

I appreciate any and all feedback to these questions.

Thanks!

I have had a nearly constant fuzzy / brain fog feeling. At first I confused it with dizziness, but its just kind of a constant disconnect.  It has been extremely frustrating/scary etc, as I usually automatically associate my symptons with some type of Cancer/Stroke etc etc  which only makes things worse.   My doctor doesnt seem to be concerned at all and has just upped my meds in an effort to help. 

I'm just wondering if any of you have had similar issues and what you may have done to help or overcome it.

Thanks!

35,0.5046298538265543,0.49537014617342295,0.132,0.772,0.096,"Hi, I stumbled upon this group searching for some answers about GAD and itching. I have been having disruptive bouts with itchy skin for about 8 months. There have been times when I've felt about [ ] this close to a breakdown over it, and have often ended up crying and in a panic attack. 

I've gone through all the possible causes I can think of:

- I thought it was dry skin for awhile, but no creams/soaps/lotions/etc. help even a little bit. 

- I thought it was environmental, some allergen at my home, so my husband and I gutted our apt. had the carpets cleaned, washed everything with sensitive laundry soap, and still no luck. Also made no sense that my husband has no symptoms like mine.

- I finally went to my dr. and she thought it could be something I was eating... however this seemed very unlikely to me, as I have an extremely varied diet and I thought for sure I would have noticed if there was a link there. But, I did try to eliminate things I'd been eating more of, like coffee, and still no change.

So, long story short, I mentioned it to my sister, who replied, ""OH I had that too! It stopped after I finished school and quit my stressful job."" !! 

I have had a pretty intense year... over a year ago, my other sister left home and cut off our family, so that has been stressful. I've felt very discontent at work for over two years, and finally decided to go back to school online to get my degree and get out—which hasn't really helped with the situation presently, but has added extra stress/time constraints. I also recently saw my doctor about depression, probably induced by all these factors, and she subscribed 5-HTP which I have been taking for nearly three weeks now. 

So with that new suggestion, I've begun to see strong links between my stress and anxiety level and the itching. Since taking 5-HTP I've still had some itching attacks, but they are much more manageable. When I can get out of my situation, take a walk, drive, watch TV, BREATHE, I start to feel better almost immediately. When I'm in the middle of an attack, I notice my breathing becomes short and I cannot concentrate. The one time I had significant relief with no attacks for a week was when I was sick on the tail end of taking time off from work—so I was out for almost two weeks straight, and NO itching during that time. 

MY QUESTION IS THIS: I find relief from taking Benadryl, because it calms me down, but makes me VERY drowsy. And I do not want to take it for a long period of time. I am taking the 5-HTP and meeting with a therapist to try to help, but this week after my first meeting I have had even more attacks of itching (even reading this group to find some answer had me scratching all over). 

TLDR: So what do you (those who have these same symptoms) do to manage it in the meantime? Topical medications? Oral meds? Something else? Is it OK to be taking Benadryl consistently for this? I just need some relief so I can work on getting to where I can manage this anxiety.

So I start off the day yesterday at about 5:30 am.  I get up and eat two bowls of cap'n crunch (I know, razor blades!!!) and everything seems ok.  At 7 am I take 30 mg of Vyvanse that my doc prescribed last week on Monday for anxiety and 500 mg of nabumetone for some pain I am having in my back and legs.  Again, everything seems ok.  Day isn't bad.  Wife gets up and gets ready for work.  Everything is ok between my wife and I.  No problems there (that I know of) and she goes off to work.  

At about 8:30 or 9:00 am I go for a walk (about 1.5 miles) and talk to my mother (mostly just listening to her go on and on about nothing).  I get back from the walk feeling sweaty and take a quick shower.  So far I am feeling my usual anxious self and some depression but nothing really bad.  I am functional.  I am ok.  

At 10 am I take my ""morning medicine,"" which consists of 1 mg Xanax extended release, 40 mg of prilosec (for my terrible stomach acid), 800 mg of Gabapentin (again, for anxiety), and 25 mg of Seroquel (anxiety).  My day goes on.  Nothing bad happens to me.  No one yells at me.  Nothing goes wrong.  I am doing research on the internet, playing my 3DS, playing around with Blender 3D.  

At about 11:30 am I eat a bag of Reese's cups.  I didn't intend to eat as many as I did.  Probably 5 and a half servings of them.  I usually eat candy but not that much.  I am trying to cut back on sugary things because of my weight (about 210 lbs).  I think this was my obvious first mistake.  I don't eat anything for lunch.  Just the candy.  

At 12:30 pm I start to feel tired.  This is when I do something new.  I drank an orange flavored ""5 hour energy.""  I usually feel tired early afternoon and my doc didn't have any advice for me so I went this route.  My wife thought it was a good entry point for someone who doesn't regularly consume caffeine.  I feel ok.  I don't go to sleep or anything.  I don't feel super jacked up.  I just feel a little tired but nothing too bad.  My anxiety still isn't over the top or anything.  The day goes on.  I spend time with my 3DS and talking to a friend on the internet. 

 At about 3 pm I start experiencing pain in my pectoral area.  Not sure if it is muscular or what, but whenever I moved just a little bit I would feel pain on both sides.  I also notice that I am feeling a little more jittery than usual.  Anxiety is starting to build up.  I try really hard to focus on my game.  I think maybe it is just the caffeine (again, not that much.  Less than a cup of coffee) and go on. 

 At 4 pm I take my day time medicines (seroquel 25 mg and gabapentin 800 mg again) and keep playing my game.  The pain is getting worse.  the anxiety is getting worse.  Everything is getting worse.  I am having trouble focusing.  Having trouble concentrating.  Not feeling well.  

My wife gets home at about 5 or 5:30 pm and is super happy that she got me some xmas presents from Target for a super good deal.  Wife is in a great mood.  She seems happy.  She is being super nice to me.  For some reason, though, every word she says upsets me.  I feel like even the smallest move she makes is going to make me start yelling.  I am super irritated and aggravated.  The pain is getting worse now and it is starting to move to the center of my chest.  I tell my wife I am not feeling well.  I try to just let it go and think about something else.  My wife has me put a pizza in the oven for her.  I didn't put one in the oven for myself because I wasn't feeling well and I didn't know what was going on.  I keep stressing to my wife that I don't feel well.  I tell her that maybe I want to go to the emergency room after I think about it for a minute.  She goes, ""that bad?!"", and then doesn't really talk too much about it.  She does ask, ""what do you think they can do?"", which is something that has been going on in my head for a while now.  The pain is pretty intense now.  The anxiety is way high.  Every small sound and movement in the house seems like it is specifically engineered to infuriate me.  I sit down on the couch and watch Hotel Impossible with my wife.  The pain is bad.  Strong burning sensation in my chest.  I feel like maybe I am dying.  This doesn't feel like heart burn.  I know it can't be a heart attack.  I start to think that maybe I am having a panic attack.  My wife looks over and sees me in pain and checks on me.  I tell her I want to go to the emergency room.  

We end up going.  The ER is only about a mile from my house.  We get in there and it is a long wait.  I tell them I am having chest pain and I feel like I am dying.  They take my vitals and hook me up to an EKG and check on my heart.  Everything is normal except for my blood pressure.  It was a bit high, but the nurse said it was normal for someone in an agitated state like I was.  Then I wait.  I am starting to feel some discomfort in my stomach now on top of the pain in my chest.  I ask my wife to find me something to eat.  She disappears for a while and then comes back with a small bag of chips, a pack of crackers, and a bag of cheez-its.  I eat the bag of chips and some of the crackers.  After eating, I was starting to feel a little better.  The burning in my chest was starting to go away.  I wait in the emergency room for hours.  No doctor visit.  I play my 3DS for a while.  I realize that I could probably just go home now and call my doctor tomorrow. 

 After waiting 3 hours to see the doctor, I end up leaving the ER and just going home and going to bed.  This wasn't heartburn.  I have had heartburn before.  That is not what this was.  I don't think being hungry had a causal link to all the shit I was experiencing.  I have been hungry before.  This hasn't happened before.  Did the panic attack pass as I was eating and calming down?  Was I suffering from low blood sugar?  High blood sugar?  Was it the 5 hour energy?  Was it the Vyvanse?  Why would I have chest pain 5 hours after drinking a 5 hour energy.  Why would I have chest pain and all these problems after I was getting near the end of the half life on my Vyvanse.  Why did I start to feel better?  What the hell happened?

I am a 30 year old man diagnosed with a bunch of psych stuff.  I live in the US (if you couldn't tell by my measurements in the post).  My doctor told me in my last visit (monday last week) that I was going to start ECT soon.  The Vyvanse was an attempt by the doctor to at least hold me over until the ECT got started.  I hadn't taken a psycho stimulant before.  I am not taking any recreational or illegal drugs.  I am taking my medications exactly as prescribed by my doctor.  I do not smoke.  I do not drink alcohol.

What happened?  Thank you for reading my insanely long post.  I apologize for the typos that you will read.  I hate proofreading.

EDIT 1: Formatting to make post easier to read.  Also, I have contacted my doctor's office and am waiting to hear back.  I spoke with his medical assistant who said I had a panic attack and to stop taking the Vyvanse."

But here is my problem, I don't leave my bed. I mean it, I don't leave my bed unless I am getting food from the kitchen or going to the bathroom. 

I just feel like I am too scared and crippled to do anything now and I'm not sure if I should give anxiety medicine another try. Please don't tell me to talk to my doctor about this, all he does is suggest different medicines for me and doesn't listen to me at all. "
38,0.9761439679125454,0.023856032087483783,0.166,0.679,0.154,"First off, I sincerely apologize for the wall of text, but there is quite a bit I want to get off of my mind. I have talked to people I know, and I would like thoughts from a broader audience, and I just found this sub.

I am a 24 year old male. I have a girlfriend of six years who makes a decent living and everything about my life is above average. I'm finishing up my first year of law school. I've noticed that, within the past year, my anxiety has hit an all-time high. I've always been an anxious person, but it has been generally manageable. This is different. This is affecting my grades and my relationship. I should also note, for the sake of disclosure, that I have been diagnosed with ADHD when I was seven years old. I did not receive medication until I was 22 because of my parents. At 22, I received a low dosage of Adderall, and I went from a C student to a straight-A student. I could actually focus. It was amazing and has been extremely helpful. I should also note that my anxiety is still there if I don't take the Adderall (I tried this because I thought the Adderall was the culprit). I have also done recreational drugs before. I smoke weed once in a while, and it helps me relax. I have done Acid once, years ago. I have done a few pain killers recreationally, but nothing recently. I smoke cigarettes occasionally, and I like good beer. I hardly ever drink during the week, though. I have also, in the past, had a prescription for Ambien and Xanax to help me sleep. I have had sleeping problems for as long as I can remember. I like being awake at night, which screws me up when I have to wake up at 6:00AM for class.

Ok, first off - a year ago I had just graduated with my bachelor's degree. I had a hard time finding a job, but I finally found one working in tech support for a company that treated its tech support staff like garbage. But, $9/hr, even if I was being treated like crap, was better than $0/hr. I spent six months at that job, and progressively got more and more unhappy and anxious. I felt like I was going nowhere and nothing I could do would make my supervisors happy, so I stopped doing any more than the bare minimum. It was during this six months that I decided to apply to law school, which I ended up getting into. So I quit that job. Not long after I quit that job, I had a huge falling out with a good friend of mine, who ""took"" three of my other friends with him, which didn't help things. But I just told myself that I knew who my real friends were, and let it go.

Now to law school. Law school is hard, and there's a lot of homework and social interactions. The insane homework load caused me to literally freak out if I didn't get it done RIGHT AWAY because I was afraid that I would forget something if I didn't. Normally, this sounds like a good way to do your homework, but it quickly got to the point that if I didn't get EVERYTHING done RIGHT AWAY, I would fret over it to the point of loosing sleep or becoming irritable with my girlfriend, which caused fights and even more lost sleep and anxiety. This anxiety about my homework has spilled over into every aspect of my life. I get anxious about unimportant things that I need to do, because I feel like I will forget about them and they will never get done. I would become anxious that I would end up pissing my girlfriend off if I did something, anything, wrong. When she acted at all abnormal, I would freak out and demand to know what I did wrong. This usually doesn't end well and I hate it. We love each other very much. I seriously don't know what I'd do without her and it kills me when we fight over something I can't seem to control. 

Now, on top of these problems, my social anxiety has hit an all time high. I have an insanely hard time talking to anyone outside of my girlfriend, my close friends that I've had since high school, and my parents. The best way I can possibly describe what goes through my head every time I have a conversation with anyone outside of my normal circle is

""Don't say something stupid. You're not talking enough, no talk more. It's silent, stop the silence. Now stop talking, they obviously don't like you. But they have to like you. Don't bring up that topic, why the hell would you do that? Now they think you're stupid. Wow your voice sounds really weird. You just mispronounced that word. What were you thinking about just now? That one word, oh yea. Now they don't understand what you were just saying. Holy fuck man can't you even finish a simple thought? No wonder everyone you meet thinks you're retarded. Does everyone really think I'm retarded? Now it's silent again and they think you're an asshole and don't want to talk to them. Wait, were they talking to me or someone behind me? Ugh, I really would like to weigh in my opinion but they'll just think it's stupid. You should make small talk. What is small talk? The weather? That's stupid. Whatever. Oh yes, the weather. Ok that's over with, what now? Awkward silence. Holy shit, this is awkward. Look at the ceiling. Look out the window. Pretend to check something on your phone. Oh wait, that will make them think you're rude. Put your phone away, even though they probably just noticed I didn't actually check anything on my phone so now they think I'm just rude and now it's been awkward for like ten minutes."" when in reality it had probably been all of 30 seconds. 

And this is what happens almost every single time I'm trying to talk to someone I don't know. I have rare times of clarity and anxiety-free social interactions, but they are few and far between. People have noticed that I've gotten worse at this, too. The one thing that has been making me worse has been when people ask  ""why?"" or tell me I need to ""confront my fear,"" like I haven't tried, or that I ""should be ok"" or ""you're life is so great. It's so much better than most people's lives. People would kill to have what you have. Why are you so anxious? What do you have to be so unhappy about?""
It's like, yes, I get it, I suck at interacting with people. I suck at being normal. I can't make small talk. Yes, I know that's a bad thing. Yes, you're right, I should try harder. I'm not doing enough to fix this. Yep, you're right, I can't be a lawyer if I can't talk to people. Yes, I understand that I'll never get ahead in life. Yes, I basically suck as a person. 

And then I tell myself, everyday, that the stuff I'm worrying about is normal. That I shouldn't worry so much. I have a good life. Stop thinking about that. That won't happen. Stop being sad, you have nothing to be unhappy about. Look at your life. You're fine. You could be poor. you could have a crappy car. You could have shitty parents. You could have a terrible girlfriend.

Yet, all the logic in the world doesn't make it go away.
All I want to do is enjoy my life again. I remember enjoying life, and I'm not right now. There's ups and downs, but it used to be normal for me to enjoy life.

So, I'm sorry if this sounded like a rant or something, but I would just like to know if I'm seriously messed up or if I'm normal and have nothing to worry about. Any responses are appreciated. Thanks!"

I got it under control by going on different medicines. About a year ago I weened myself off prozac because I was feeling depressed anyways and the side effects were too much, including feeling numb,emotionless and zero sex drive. Since then I have been fine albeit some depression bouts.

Here's the weird thing that I need advice on- I've been having some medical issues lately with my stomach. On the 20th last month I ended up feeling faint at work and having maybe a panic attack or maybe a dizzy spell I don't know what it was. I was sent to the ER and decided to take a medical leave to figure our my medical issues once and for all because my stomach problems were keeping me from preforming at work and school. So since the 20th I have been staying at my moms and having an endless amount of panic attacks, when I was previously not having any at all! Out of no where I am anxious all day, I feel like I'm having a nervous breakdown. I feel like I am dying and every weird little symptom is convincing me I have a brain tumor or stomach cancer or that I'm bleeding internally etc. I have no slept at all. I've been waking up with nocturnal panic attacks and generally haven't left the house. I feel like my life has been totally taken away from me and I am at the mercy of these panic attacks. I was scheduled to have a endoscopy is figure out whats wrong with my stomach on friday but I had a panic attack and they took me to urgent care instead of preforming the operation. (I have emetophobia so anyone sticking anything down my throat and into my stomach, while i'm conscious is my worst fear) But I have to have it to know whats wrong with my body and to get healthy. So I have some questions for you guys..

Have you ever had a insanely strong resurgence of panic attacks and GAD out of seemingly nowhere?

Where you able to move on and return to normal life in a timely matter?

How I stop myself from having panic attacks about medical symptoms?

How can I make myself have this endoscopy without having a panic attack? (they do not allow anti anxiety meds before the sedation.)

any help with amazingly appreciated.Thank you"
40,0.9301772205491056,0.06982277945089514,0.126,0.77,0.105,"Hello everyone.  I just wanted to share with you my experience of anxiety and how I feel like I'm starting to take control and I hope that some of it will benefit you all.  

I never really had anxiety much until I was 23 and in the military.  Believe it or not, I feel like most of my anxiety can be traced back to when I was getting promoted at a ceremony that was supposed to be exciting.  I never had an issue with crowds or being the center of attention- I was so excited for this event!  So I'm up there in front of approximately 100 people standing at attention (Standing straight with arms to the side;not moving).  I start shaking a little bit; I've had my normal 5 cigarettes and Monster energy drink by this time of the day (9am).  I think nothing of the shakes and continue to wait my turn to get promoted.  As I'm waiting I notice the shakes get worse- it's not just my legs anymore, now I can feel my back starting to quiver, taking away from the picture perfect sailor (spare me the Navy jokes, I've heard them all :D) I had always been.  I break my thousand-yard stare only to see other people watching, nudging the person next to them to look at me, thinking WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY??  I fight this feeling I have, heart racing, breathing constricted- determined to stay as still as possible for this event.  At this point my back is spasm-ing, legs shaking- I'm a fucking mess.  I made it through the ceremony somehow, as people walked by to congratulate me some asked if I was okay, some smirked, and of course all my friends teased me relentlessly about it.  This small event will go on to define the next few years.

The teasing subsided after a few days, and it was business as normal.  Other people got awards in front of the squadron and I stood at attention just fine for them in the crowd watching them, wishing I could have kept my composure for my big day.  I was then due to receive an award for my outstanding service for an inspection we had.  Many others were to receive commendation as well, so I was in the third row receiving the award.  I stood there anxiously while everybody crowded the hangar to observe the ceremony.  My heart started racing, muscles shaking again- I knew this dreaded feeling all too well.  I had to leave.  Luckily I managed to get out of it by telling my superior that I could NOT stand there, and I was allowed to wait outside.  I went to see a doctor after this incident.

The doctor told me I had an essential tremor that was made worse by stress and anxiety and I was prescribed propanolol.  I didn't notice many benefits while taking it but I could tell by the horrible feelings when I missed a dose.  I continued taking it regardless.  After disgracing myself twice through these awards I started thinking that ""What if I have a panic attack simply watching others get an award"".  The Captain Picard of my brain replied ""Make it so"".. and simply from thinking that thought I caused myself to have anxiety while not being the center of attention.  Damnit, Picard.  

Every time an award was to take place, I was nowhere to be found.  Avoiding the feelings I dreaded most.  At this point, I ONLY had anxiety at award ceremonies. 

Fast forward 4 years, I volunteer to go to Iraq (to avoid doing another deployment on a boat).  No anxiety that any normal person wouldn't have during this deployment.  Everything was business as usual for me.  Turns out the U.S. was leaving Iraq 5 months after I got there.  We were faced with the choice of either going back to the U.S. (where my Navy contract would expire and I would be a civilian again), or take reassignment to Afghanistan.  I chose Afghanistan.  While in Afghanistan I was able to take 2 weeks of ""vacation"".  The military puts you on a plane and sends you where you want to go.  I returned home.  Spent two weeks with my family and on my flight from XXX-Atlanta (where I would return to Kuwait, and ultimately- Afghanistan) I had a panic attack on the tarmac headed to the runway.  My irrational mind contemplated telling them to turn around, or even just running out the emergency exit.  I was terrified.  

I arrived to Atlanta airport and sought the doctor there, as I had 9 hours until my next flight.  I kept thinking that if I had a panic attack on my last flight, this next leg of my trip would be unbearable as it was a 14 hour flight.  I was prescribed Xanax.  ZZZzzzZZZ all the way to Afghanistan.

While back in Afghanistan all I could do was dwell on this horrible incident.  Why did this happen to me again?  Was this going to be a recurring event?  I've wanted to be a pilot since I was a child and planned on flight school after this- can I still do that?  Hundreds of questions about myself ran through my mind.  I met with a counselor in Afghanistan and was prescribed Prozac.

The counselor helped a little bit, and I'm not entirely sure if the medication helped at all because I still felt anxious.  Keep in mind that I was never involved in a direct gun fight with the enemy.  Once again I felt horrible because here I am in this horrible place and I have anxiety not war-related.  Granted there were a few close calls- a group of rockets passed between 10-20 feet over my head while I was working at a guard shack.  I calculated that from the distance they were fired from had they aimed just a few centimeters lower, I might have been hit.  I'm thankful that I wasn't.  We also got mortared- a lot.  That's scary because you never know where they are going to hit until they land.  Your body adapts and you become used to it to a certain extent.  I did receive my award for service over there though with the help of Xanax.

The flight to the U.S. did not bother me when I left.  I guess I was so excited to come home that I forgot that I was supposed to be afraid of flying now.  I returned home and everything was fine and I separated from the military and returned home for civilian life.  I had big plans though.  

My fiance and I moved to Florida where I would attend college and take flight training to satisfy my goal of being a pilot.  While very heavy on the wallet- I flew.  I was very good at it and not once did I experience the anxiety that I once knew all too well.  Life was great.  

Until Christmas break.  During the few weeks off of school from the beginning of December until early January I had time to think- too much time.  I played a lot of video games and didn't really do a whole lot with myself except think.  I was in the Navy Reserves and had a similar panic attack at an award ceremony one weekend- can't stand still, back tremors, the works.  This got me to thinking.  If I still have that issue, what if I have a panic attack on the plane?  What if I have a panic attack while getting a haircut or something crazy like that?  Well, the good ole Captain Picard ""made it so"".  I could barely keep my head still getting my hair cut that weekend, and I was heavily medicated on the flight to and from home.

Back to Florida, time to fly again.  I flew once, when I got back and decided I could not do it anymore.  I was on the verge of a full blown panic attack for the entire training flight.  Much to my dismay I dropped out of the flight training course citing ""lack of funds"".  So here I am in Florida, not flying, embarrassed, ashamed.  What was I to do?  I kept going to school and thought of back up plans.  

Navy reserve weekend again, it was a Sunday and I was determined to get the hell out of the place before I had another panic attack at the normal ceremony.  I said I was sick and left early.  On the 2 hour drive back home I had a panic attack on the interstate.  Great, now I associated driving, getting a hair cut, and a slew of other things with fear.

I missed a lot of class that semester, failed a class, and was actually house-ridden for about a week and a half.  I refused to get in a car or go anywhere.  I decided to call the local VA Hospital and schedule an appointment.  I need help and I knew it.  The first thing the VA wanted to do was give me medication.  I didn't want to take medication as the onset of the problem was quite rapid for the most part, so I was determined to get through it without medication.  But they prescribed it anyways and I took it home and took 1 dosage of this SSRI.  They also set me up with an appointment at a Veteran Center- not run by the VA, but there to support Veterans.  I went to this appointment the next day and met with a counselor there who has thus far given me so much help I don't think I could ever repay her.

She was an alternative-medicine type therapist and helped me talk some things out and give me some coping strategies.  She taught me a technique called EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) that involves tapping on certain points to calm oneself down.  It actually works, sometimes fast, sometimes it takes time, but it works.  That, combined with the coping strategies, got me on my feet and out the door again.  

For the year or so after that, it was a combination of meeting with her, but also trying to find ""The Cure"" to my problem on the side.  I think we've all been there.  The Cure, doesn't exist for most.  I tried looking at vitamin deficiencies, random herb pills that worked short-term at best and all sorts of other things.  I didn't find my Cure.  If you've read this far, I doubt you have either.  

The past year or so has been a rollercoaster- some days I would be on top of the world, others- anxiety through the roof.  Through 2 books I've been reading, and my counselors help, I have finally got on the road to recovery.  The books are called ""At Last a Life: Anxiety and Panic Free"" by Paul David and ""Hope and Help for Your Nerves"" by Dr. Claire Weekes.  Just for the record I am not affiliated with them and am not making a cent should you buy their E-books on Amazon (which you can read on your cell phone, as well).

 I know I'll have days where I am an emotional wreck but through these books and my session, I have learned to not fear fear.  It has been my biggest struggle.  That, and projecting my fear onto future events which eventually come true because that how I pictured they would.  Now, I welcome every bit of anxiety because it gives me another chance to prove to myself that I can do it.  Every time I welcome these feelings, I feel them lose their strength on my life just a little bit.  All of this didn't happen overnight.  Some of it did, after reading a few chapters of the books before bed I would feel more equipped to handle the day's stresses and challenges but I faltered occasionally. 

I'm not 100% and I'm not sure if I ever will be.  I've given up on trying to be ""the person I was before all this"", because that person doesn't exist any more.  That person hasn't gone through the trials that I (or you) have.  All we can try to do is be a stronger person than we were yesterday.  I will warn you, though- it involves getting out of your comfort zone.  Take baby steps.  For me it was like ""Okay, I'm going to find a barber I'm comfortable with, and go there for a while"".  Believe me, once you start doing things that you never thought you could do again, you will realize how little power anxiety has over you.  

I haven't done any more flight training- I have a baby on the way and realized that everything happened for a reason.  I like to think that God planned it out for me that way, or the universe knew that being a pilot wasn't a sustainable career for me at this point in my life (new FAA laws/subpar pay).  I do want to finish getting my pilot licenses at some later point in life but I realized that there's no point in dwelling on  things I haven't done or achieved because I have different things to achieve at this point in time.

I realize this was long, and I did not intend that.  I also realize that not many will read this whole thing.  I just wanted to put it all out there and maybe if I somehow helped just one person I'll be overjoyed.    I am also getting married in a week, which is similar to the situations that I got anxious for, but I met with my counselor today and between scheduling the appointment last week, and meeting with her, I realized I have nothing to be afraid of.  

I wish nothing but the best for all of you dealing with anxiety and hope that you all can find peace with it.

TL;DR
You can conquer anxiety."

I realized I was trans at 16, came out to my mother and father at 17, and started Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) at 18. It's been a year since I started and I love what it's done with my body. I look like a girl in every way, I have a feminine shape, boobs, hips, and a girly face. I have a feminine voice that doesn't make anyone suspect a thing when I speak. I'm young, pretty, and attractive (or so I'm told). I pass as a girl without a second thought. 

I did well in high school and am going into the honors program of a good college.

My depression and anxiety are fairly well controlled, I am on meds that help me significantly. My last year at high school was a bit of a mess mentally, I was really depressed during first semester, and my anxiety kept me from finishing assignments and scoring well on tests. I was suicidal for most of the time, but never attempted, though I did select a method and started writing a suicide note.

I saw therapists and a psychiatrist, who put me on Lexapro, which has helped me tons. I also have a supply of Xanax for anxiety-ridden periods.

I came out as MtF (Male to Female) in December, to a mostly supportive school, with surprisingly supportive facalty. I lost one of my best friends, but aside from him I still had a close-knit group of friends to be with. I made good friends with some former acquaintances who had new incentive to get to know me better. I became almost popular in my peer group of nerdier kids. People said plenty of things behind my back, but never to my face. I still got an awkward question now and then, but I was fine. My depression and anxiety seemed to go away, and I finished the year academicaly strong, and got the IB Diploma I had worked for through high school.

College starts next month and I've had some time to think. I've realized something. This physique I've worked for my entire life isn't something I can give up. This will surely sound quite vain, but now that I have beauty I can't bear to lose it. Aging terrifys me and I'm scared of what the future will bring.

Honestly the way I forsee my life going is that I finish college, find a nice guy to settle down with, maybe adopt a kid or get a surrogate, and then kill myself once my body starts to fade. I feel so selfish that I could just turn my back on my family and friends like that, but I feel like that's how it has to end. I don't feel like there's much of a point beyond that. I don't want to sit by and slowly watch my body deteriorate. I just want to end myself at a high point in my life. Death doesn't really seem so bad to me either, it's like a final peace and calm. Eveything in life feels so temporary to me. This is a really dark thought, but I feel like comitting suicide with a partner would be oddly romantic. I don't know, but I feel like there has to be something wrong with me to think this way."

**tl;dr: I think it's working, despite a big low point at the start, and continued issues getting to sleep.**

First, some context: I'm a [28m] grad student who's pursuing a master's after spending 4 years working at a startup which was very fast-paced, and essentially took over my life. My research is extremely unguided, hazy, and open-ended, so it's very hard for me to gauge if I'm making 'enough' progress.

The weekend of 3 weeks ago marked an extreme low point for me. I had set a deadline, and been telling everyone that I would finish the master's by September, but started to realize that sticking to this plan would take a huge toll on my mental health, and the few coping strategies I'd developed for my anxiety &amp; depression would probably fall into significant disuse.

Up until this point I was strongly averse to medication, and had put all of my energy into trying various mindfulness or cognitive techniques (quite a lot of meditation, have been reading about ACT, but have never made a strong attempt at CBT). Finally, over that weekend I re-watched [this video](http://www.penny-arcade.com/patv/episode/drugs) and decided that my current attempts weren't getting the results I had hoped for, and so it was time to try something new. On the Monday I scheduled an appointment with an on-campus doctor. She initially (without a whole lot of inquiry or digging) wrote up a script for Zoloft, but I mentioned that I had read up on Lexapro, and wanted to try it, so she wrote a new one without giving it a second thought. I had my first dose by 7pm that night.

The first week that I was on 10mg of Cipralex was really, *really* shitty for me. I was sleeping in past 10am (which is easier because I almost always work from home), and had zero motivation to do any sort of work on my research. I cancelled several social activities, including plans for the coming weekend, and looking back it's hard to even remember what I did, besides feeling like crap and beating myself up for feeling like crap. 

I think 3 things kept me from giving up on the meds at that time:

* Hearing some stories, either here or on other forums, about people having really high stress/anxiety when they first get on the meds.
* Not being sure if this was caused by the meds themselves, or if I'd starting taking them just the nick of time, and that first weekend was just the tip of a particularly depressing &amp; shitty iceberg.
* Hearing the guys from Penny Arcade talking about how it changed their lives (and their co-workers').

So that was Week 1. And throughout that whole time, I don't think I got to sleep before 1am, and would often wake up 3-4 times a night, which was extremely unusual for me. I was also getting some mild stomach issues for the first 2-3 days, where I was only eating about half of what I usually do, then feeling full/gassy. 

By week 2 I stepped up to 20mg as per my prescription, and was starting to accept that I probably wasn't going to finish the master's by September, and that this is going to be a time when I need to seriously shift my priorities, and focus on getting better. Still having difficulties sleeping, still sleeping in just as late. Still making little or no progress on my research, but starting to change my mindset and not be so hard on myself about that.

By last week I started taking my dose in the morning instead of dinner time, with the small hope that that would reduce the insomnia. It didn't. I met with my doctor and explained the low mood I'd gone through the first week, and she suggested upping the dosage to 40mg, which I told her I wasn't really comfortable with, so she kept it at 20. By the end of the week, when I got the new prescription I mentioned to the pharmacist that I was still having difficulty sleeping, despite the morning dosage. She suggested switching to late evening, and I've been trying that since Friday, with no real change in ability to get to sleep (which, if you haven't already picked up on, is a bit of a concern for me). 

On the bright side, this past week the amount of worrying, and random thoughts going through my head *feel* like they've gone down substantially. I'm noticing this when I do sit down to meditate, and I find that I can read a page in a book without thinking about what I should eat for lunch next Thursday. So there are some definite pros, to go with the main downside of not getting more than 4-5 hours of crappy, intermittent sleep, and often feeling like I just want to snooze for another 2-3 hours when my alarm goes off.

Two questions I have for you fine folks:

* Has anyone experienced insomnia, but had it subside over time without the addition of some other medication?
* Is my concern about my doctor's willingness to change prescriptions at the drop of a hat (which I perceive as a lack of scrutiny), a valid one, or am I just getting anxiety about the person who's trying to help me be less anxious?"

I told my mom how I've been having trouble with violent intrusive thoughts the other day, and it was a pretty bad idea because after I told her about them, it just got way worse. She misunderstood what I was trying to explain to her, and I think part of her is scared I'll act on these thoughts. 

I talked to her tonight and she kept saying ""I need to know if you're thinking about hurting me"" I just broke down and cried, because these thoughts have begun to ruin my life. I'd never hurt my mom, I love her with all my heart.. but when my mom says stuff like that it just adds fuel to my anxiety, making me even more anxious that I'll act on them.

I'm going to see my doctor tomorrow if possible, to try and start some medication to help cope with my anxiety.
 
The thing is I'm really scared to tell my Dr about my intrusive thoughts, because I'm scared I'd end up getting put into a mental hospital, from what I hear intrusive thoughts are common. So for anyone who has told their doctor about their intrusive thoughts, do I have anything to worry about?

If anyone has any tips and tricks on how to calm down these intrusive thoughts, I'd greatly appreciate it. I've been struggling so bad these past few days because I have no friends to confide in.

I live in the northwest so he said that most of the people he sees are deficient to some extent and he recommends it to most of his patients. We were talking about the various benefits which include improving brain function, possibly preventing neurological disorders later in life, it acts as a mild anti-depressant, among the obvious known benefits. So i told him i would try it and he wrote me a prescription for 50000 ui capsules once per week for 12 weeks. This seemed like a lot to me considering that most supplements are around 400 ui per day. So, naturally i did some research and found that this is a normal amount given to people who are deficient and because it stores in fat and releases over time that you only take it once per week. Also, in my research i read about the rare bad things it can possibly cause, even people reporting panic attacks from taking it. Great. Now, like every medicine i get i don't want to take it. Even though the possibilities of it working great or even just doing nothing at all far exceed the possible verrrry rare negatives im having a tough time. Shit it took me a long time to even try diazepam, the very thing that helps me with my panic attacks.

Has anyone tried vitamin D?
If so, have you taken a weekly large amount like i was prescribed? 
Did it work?
Did you have any negative side effects?"

I've noticed a slight tolerance increase, 1mg feels like .5mg nowadays, and I don't want this to be an issue. So my question is, how often is too often and how should I take it to avoid physical dependence?

My insecurities have almost led to me destroying my relationship with my incredibly loving boyfriend, but thankfully his support and love has made us more stable than anything.

Looking back I have had three instances, where I have out of nowhere just fainted. The first time was on holidays, I was standing by a bus stop several years ago with my father and suddenly everything just went black and I fainted. after a few minutes of resting everything went back to normal. I cant recall the onset as it was so long ago but it was quite unexpected, my father just assumed it might be from the heat (38 degrees celsius) and being dehydrated.

Then comes another few instances, all in a social setting, most of the time alcohol was involved or even marijuana but both in moderation. Around friends I wouldnt call myself insecure in the slightest, so the one time I do believe it might have been too much marijuana and my body just temporarily failing. Again, after 10 minutes I was fine. (I do not use it anymore, as my anxiety keeps me away from smoking it nowadays, which is ironic because in places of legalization many people take it as remedy for anxiety.)

Then another time after a couple beers and having a marijuana joint, the same thing happened, all went black and I fainted for a good 3 minutes. My friends immediately put me in a cab home thinking I had drunk too much.

However, the reason I believe it is not CAUSED by , but merely made worse by alcohol &amp; marijuana is because one time it was without any intake of substances;
I was simply having a shower and freaked out because i thought i had noticed an abnormality on my body (which turned out to be nothing), My heart started racing, I freaked out and once again everything started to go black. I quickly sat down in the shower and after a couple minutes of breathing slowly I was all fine. 

Now having looked a bit into Anxiety disorders, it does sound a great lot like I suffer from it. I have always been very good at school, never had issues making friends and am not horrible looking either, but somehow I am extremely insecure and have no self esteem...I believe the neglect of hobbies plays a large role since doing things you enjoy and are good at and where endorphins are involved would certainly prevent such anxiety.

But as of right now, being aware I should increase hobbies such as sports, I would really like to know if I need to be worried. Sometimes when I overworry about something my heart starts racing and racing and I actively have to calm myself down.


A friend of mine who has similar issues has a psychiatrist for a mother and has been taking anti depressants and said they have greatly improved her quality of life, i am just interested what you all think, how do i go about this, it really does impact my life as my self esteem is just..awful and despite having supporting family and partner who tell me how good I am at things and how pretty I am those things just dont have any effect on me. 

I noticed I am over observant in social settings, as to how people act, and i think the fact that i am extremely empathetic is a key factor as well. If someone is feeling uncomfortable I immediately pick it up without even intending to. I always feel the need to make them feel better, its as though my brain just picks up all the uneasiness of others, makes them feel better and in return i end up stuck with all these shit feelings...

i dont know what to do and am honestly considering therapy or some medications that will just calm me down. Sorry about the lack of formatting and structure but I have never really talked to anyone about this so am a bit disheveled. 

Would appreciate ANY kind of advice and thoughts.
Much love,

54,0.04640892389132573,0.9535910761086394,0.132,0.754,0.114,"Hi everyone. I've been lurking on this subreddit for a couple of months now. I actually didn't know it existed until pretty recently. It's been great reading other people's posts and knowing that what I feel isn't something that only I go through. Because of this, I decided I should reach out.

For reference, I'm a 22-year-old female living in the USA. I am currently taking Lexapro. The best definition of the anxiety I have faced throughout most of my life has been contained in the descriptions for Generalized Anxiety Disorder. However, lately, things have been a little different.

For more context, I'll kind of go over what anxiety has been like for me. As a child, my family moved around relatively often. I didn't notice how quiet and nervous I was until I was around 10. Everyone always said I was just ""shy,"" etc. By the time I reached high school, what had started as just a general inability to speak to most people (extreme social anxiety) had become more like depression. I felt that there was something wrong and broken within me and didn't know what to do. I often thought people would be better off without me, or that if I was gone, no one would miss me. This did not make my crippling social anxiety any more manageable.

This kind of went on through my first year or two of college. Though, I managed to make a little progress with the depression. It helped a lot to have such a caring support system behind me. But I still maintained the social anxiety, and actually began to have a lot of trouble sleeping, and be terrified of germs. The thought of even leaving my room was sometimes too much for me to handle. Going anywhere where there might be people sneezing or coughing made me feel intense panic, which made school difficult, and bus rides practically unbearable.

By January of 2013, it had all become too much. Friends could always see that there was something wrong, but finally, one close friend told me he was worried for me, and that he knew how I felt was a burden on me, and that I shouldn't have to manage so much alone. After this conversation, I talked to my mom, and we decided I should go to our family doctor to talk about what I was going through. He asked me a lot of questions, and ended up prescribing Lexapro. 

The Lexapro has honestly made such a difference in my life. I am much more willing to talk to people now, and have been able to make my fear of germs and infection at least manageable. Things were really looking up for a while, since the medication was prescribed. I do realize, though, that the pills are just a tool to help me find balance. They don't magically make everything better. I have to be willing to work on things too. And I have been.

As I said, things had been a lot better. That is, until I graduated from college last May. I am currently unemployed and am having a lot of difficulty in finding a job, especially one related to my degree. I've noticed a switch flip in me the past few months. I feel like I have reverted back into feeling depressed about 60% of the  time. I sleep for hours upon hours every day and have a lot of trouble getting up. It always seems like a better option to go ahead and aim for 10 or more hours of sleep, or even to just stay in bed rather than start the day. I've also been having panic attacks and getting angry. I'm not generally an angry person. I've always been very chill and calm, but lately I lash out at people for no reason, especially my poor boyfriend, who is so supportive, and someone I'm so thankful for. I find myself feeling so unreasonably angry for even the smallest reasons, that would never have usually made me upset. I feel immense guilt, and like a failure, over not being able to find a job, even though I realize that this is actually quite common anymore. 

I guess I'm just here hoping someone may have some advice for me. I'm wondering if this is just temporary, from my life changing so drastically recently (graduating, entering the ""real world,"" being unemployed and alone at home all day), or if it might be something more serious that I should do something about. I know no one here can tell me that for sure, or give me medical advice. But does anyone maybe have any tips for dealing with things like I've described, short of therapy or more/different medication? Anything you can say would be much appreciated. I know some people have worse problems than I do, and that I'm lucky to have what I have. I've debated about posting at all, worried about judgement and negative reaction, but I honestly just feel like I could use some help. Thank you so much to anyone who replies."

So here's the back story: I recently started a relationship with a girl who used to simply be a friend that I made up every which reason for not being able to chase after her (was secretly crushing on her and we were close friends) and then she came and showed interest in me and I went right for it. I am madly in love with her and find her to be the greatest thing ever and know I am also a bit clingy. Anyways we've been together for almost two months and in the last week or so I feel like she's distanced her self greatly from me and is overall irritated by everything I do. It feels like she's degenerated from being my significant other to a simple acquaintance. I'm assuming this is a trigger for me as I've been in a relationship before where they showed interest and I perused to be lead on then dropped like a bad habit and blamed my self for it thinking i went wrong somewhere. Now I have a feeling of inadequacy and have that whole ""I'm doing something wrong and don't know what"" feeling and its acting as a trigger bring multiple break downs a day which I have been free of for about 3 years now. I have already talked to her about it and she told me that its not anything I'm doing things are just bothering her and she prefers not to talk about it. Regardless I cannot shake the feeling I'm whats wrong and every little thing she dose that feels like she's trying to distance herself from me acts as a trigger, it could be anything some thing as little as no response to a text I sent to her, or even receiving a one word response to a text I sent to her expecting a larger response. Anyways I cannot think of any solutions aside from breaking up with her which is the last thing I want to do and want to ask for any ideas on how to cope with this (no meds please). If you have no ideas but took the time to read thanks for listening. Other general info if needed: Age: 16 (Junior in High School), No meds or any drug use. Types of anxiety: Separation and PTSD (from bullying at a younger age). Again thank you."

I would really appreciate resources if anyone has any. Also, here's why I think I have anxiety...

On the 17th of December I stayed up all night and in the morning I think I had a really bad panic attack, my first one ever...I kept feeling waves of heat inside of my head and that's how I knew that it was more of a mental thing, I started shaking really bad, frequent urination, weird breathing and I've had two more since, it's sounding like panic attacks to me...I have never had this issue before, I've been talking to friends and they usually help a bit in distracting me from whatever is bothering me. My second panic attack happened immediately after I was meditating which makes me really adverse to trying it again...I've completely cut sugar out of my diet, I'm scared to eat it because I assume it makes them worse. I have trouble sleeping, it seems to get worse at night but I've only had three. 

I think I was triggered by thinking about manual breathing the second time, in meditation as some of you may know, it's important to concentrate on your breathing and in doing so I think that I may have triggered it but I'm not sure because it happened after I got done meditating. 

the third time it was triggered because I was worrying about whether or not I was bothering someone. Third one has been the easiest one to deal with so far. 

It's really hard for me to relax after I have one, I start stimming in order to keep them at bay and I eat less and it's incredibly hard to fall asleep because sometimes the feeling of heat starts to seep in. When that happens I usually hop up and pace around the house. It was really bad after my second one because it was suddenly a reoccurring thing, I didn't think that I was ever going to feel that again after the first one. 

Thinking that birth control may have started all this but I don't know for sure and I don't know when it will get out of my system...

thank you guys for reading, I'm sorry...I'm very new to all of this, I don't know if this is a lifelong thing or a temporary thing, it freaks me out that maybe I messed myself up for life...is there a diet you recommend that I go on? I'm going to start working out every day or at least most...I have been to the doctor, got blood work done, waiting for the results and going to try to discuss that I'm pretty certain I have been having panic attacks...don't know what he's supposed to do about them, do I just ride them out for a few weeks to wait and see if maybe they go away? Do I even want medication since it seems like you have to kind of shuffle through them to see which ones work and which ones don't...?

Not that there's anything wrong with doing that, but for me, it seems so unfulfilling. 

Having said that, I've never had much issues with anxiety. But this realization has made me sleepless and anxious, leading me to go to the doctor. I recently had to take some melatonin to improve my sleep quality as well as other medication to calm myself down. I'm not sure if it's working, but I still feel nervous to go work every time I wake up. I feel so stressed, helpless and I feel like I've wasted my own time and it's my own fault.

He has ADHD and can be extremely disorganized and cluttered- the clutter from all his impulse purchases and disorganization from his scattered ADHD brain. I am realizing that his disorganization and clutter is a HUGE trigger for me. Because of that, this move is making me completely balls-to-the-wall anxious. I know the move in is the right step for our relationship, but the stress is driving me crazy and I am having a hard time dealing with it. 

On top of the fact that I work for a civil litigation firm that is neck-deep in trial. Last week, I worked 12 hour days EVERY day, plus 6 hours Saturday. I have NO time or energy to move and get things organized and getting my SO to help has proven to be difficult. A lot of my stress comes from the fact that his things are all over the house (he's lived there for a year) and its difficult for me to find room for my things. I dont know what of his I can toss, move, whatever, to make room for my stuff. 

For example: we share the master closet. His clothes took 2/3rd of the room even after he ""cleaned"" it out. I pointed this out to him and asked him to make more room for me. He told me just to throw his stuff somewhere to make room for my stuff. While I am happy to have my clothes in their place, there is now a large amount of his clothes sitting on the dresser for DAYS now. I don't want to remove his things to make room for mine, only to have his stuff clutter the space instead. I am becoming a nag because I have to constantly ask him to clean stuff, make room, etc., and even with the constant reminders he still wont do it sometimes. I HATE feeling like a nag and I don't want to be in a relationship where that's the role I have to take. I'm worried that this difference in living styles is going to be the thing that breaks our relationship. We are great partners in every other way, though, and I dont want my anxiety over his living style to end things. But honestly, I seriously cannot live like this. I hoping that once things are moved in and organized (and trial over at work) that my anxiety will be much better. I am not on meds currently, because I had to go get a blood test before my MD will give me meds. However, with my job being nuts, I haven't had time to get the necessary blood work, which is also stressing me out that I cant get the help I need right now.

Anyway, I just needed to vent so thank you.

I've always found it cathartic to write my thoughts and have them read, so I hope you will be able to offer me some advice. I have always dealt with anxiety, primarily health anxiety. I tend to worry about that which I have no control over. My earliest memory of anxiety was worrying the roof of my mouth was eroding: I was four. I've been seeing specialists since the fifth grade, but I don't feel I've made much progress at all. Up until last year, my anxiety had been tolerable. I was able to suppress it and actually enjoy my life to some degree, I very rarely had panic attacks and only became anxious when in crowds (a concert, movie theater... I did not enjoy gym class). In January of 2011 I became concerned with my environment and the effect it may have had on my life. I live in very close proximity to a main road and an oil refinery, and I have neighbors in my area who use a fireplace to heat their homes. I obsessed over organic food and detoxification, I demanded to know the source of my vegetables and whether they were treated with pesticides and I began to withdraw from friends. I became less interested in school and here is where I believe my anxiety amplified.





 For some incomprehensible reason, in May of 2011 I decided I could no longer live at home. Home was creating my anxiety and I needed to leave immediately. I decided to live with my aunt and uncle for one month as an intermediary before moving into my godmothers (I will not touch on this much, but I will say this was one of the worst months of my life. There was an incident involving an oil furnace, and since I have hypersensitivity to fumes I nearly went mad). I saw my godmothers home as a utopia, an environment where I may finally focus on schoolwork and seek treatment for my mental health. I finally moved into my godmothers in June of 2011. I enjoyed my summer, granted my anxiety was inhibiting me from enjoying it to its fullest.







I began a ritual where I would leave my home every third day, because I felt this would minimize my exposure to environmental toxins. I became obsessed with achieving optimum cognitive health and I started to take several supplements (wheatgrass, spirulina, omega-3 fish oil, acai) and go on daily hikes. I was doing well. September introduced the new school year, and as luck may have it I suffered a fall a couple of weeks into the month, nearly suffering a concussion. I was not injured, though my anxiety was leading me to believe I was having secondary effects (intracranial pressure, perhaps a subdural hematoma). I was constantly feeding my anxiety by researching symptoms and complications.






 My relationship with my godmother became increasingly negative over the course of the next several months which lead me to moving out in January, earlier this year. I was placed in a shelter while my social worker searched for a new apartment for me. I began to skin pick (my acne), almost unconsciously, and I would do so for the duration of my stay (five weeks). The notion of infection did not cross my mind, I thought what I was doing was harmless. I ended up leaving awful, awful scars over my chest, shoulders and spanning across the entire top of my back. I did not suffer an infection, but I realized the severity of my behavior and told my mother I wanted to schedule an appointment with a doctor. This lead to me moving home with my parents once more, I'd not been living there for seven months. It did not take long for my anxiety to manifest into something more dire. 







 I now had an entirety of time to myself since I was not attending school. I used this time to research symptoms and illnesses, all relating to skin infection. I became so frightened that I completely stopped skin picking, and as of now I have not picked for over four weeks. I have been to the emergency room three times in the past month due to fear of infection, and I have been reassured ad nauseum that there is none. I am not overly concerned of whether I am already infected; I am concerned with my susceptibility and risk of infection. My back, though healing, has open scabs and I cannot even shower anymore without noticing blood on the towels. I notice blood on my pillows. I notice blood on my T-shirts (Actually, I should note, I have been prescribed minocycline and a topical cream for my acne, so yes, I have been given medication). I try to treat my wounds as best I can with an antibiotic ointment. Others find my hygiene to be obsessive. I am doing everything I can to prevent infection. Yet I still worry. There are three infections that I am most concerned with: Necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis and cellulitis. I have read all three are mostly found in individuals with compromised immune symptoms, and one of these is actually exceedingly rare, yet my anxiety is convinced that I will become a statistic. 





 Since I always have minor breakages in my skin, and since these diseases are so opportunistic, seeping in at the slightest trauma, I worry that I will eventually suffer from one of them. Using last night as an example, two scabs broke and bled and I began crying, applying polysporin like a damn maniac. Pathetic imagery, huh? It's gotten to the point where I cannot even enjoy a book anymore. I haven't been to school in over two months because my anxiety has completely consumed me. I am on my sixth day of anxiety medication (celexa) and I am seeing my family doctor once every week, in addition to my psychologist once every week. I'm actually meeting with a psychiatrist this month as well, so I am seeking support. I just need to know what to do in the meantime. I feel like I'm being crushed by my anxiety.






 All I do anymore, really, is lay in bed and sob. just waiting for infection to set in and ravage me. It's funny to note that just under two months ago I'd been digging my dirty fingernails, that I'd not washed in days, into my flesh and freeing the pus from beneath. I've never been so scared of anything in my life, but this has just about ruined me. I feel like I'm missing some things, and this may not be very cohesive, but please, Reddit, help me. If there is anything you are wondering, I will be glad to answer your questions.

I spend my nights writing out what I'm going to eat, the calorie count, I create diet plans, work out plans, then I stew and worry about what I ate and if I ate too much. I will sometimes rewrite these things over and over. I'll stay up worrying about how much I ate the previous day, I'll worry about talking about it to someone and getting help, becasue I'm afraid to get treatment becasue I don't think it's that bad. Some nights I'll stay up and binge and purge, and stress that I didn't get it all out.

I'm not sure of a diagnosis, because at any given time I can meet the diagnostic criteria for at least two (possibly three) disorders--so I'm not sure how I'm classed. My armchair opinion (and that of a couple therapists) is that I've basically had pretty severe GAD my whole life, and when you combine that with stuff that's happened through my life, I've picked up the symptomology of other disorders.

I've been on multiple medications. With the exception of benzos, nothing has worked. When I'm in therapy, I'm always at such a crisis point that the therapy has to focus on the immediate need, and not on long-term. I'm constantly so strung up that I cannot focus on learning coping skills. Every session is ""talk her off the edge of a proverbial cliff"". Trying stuff at home is a battle between motivation, and then becoming so anxious I cannot concentrate on the activity (like yoga). Distraction is my main coping method.

The absolute *biggest* trigger for my anxiety is the unknown. It can be in any area--social, my pets, work, etc. The biggest trigger lately has been finances. I spent some time unemployed, and money was a huge issue. So now I have a hard time spending money, make decisions are large purchases impulsively (because the anxiety is so great I just want to get it over with ASAP), and constantly worry about having enough for the future..among other things. 

I'm in the process of (probably) trading my car. The car is at the point where repairs, and the potential for more repairs probably outweighs the value..and is frankly causing my a ton of stress through worrying. So the dealer ordered the car I think I want (gotta drive it first), and if all goes well, I'll be talking trade-in. This is a decision I have again snap made because of anxiety, but everyone (except reddit) agrees this is the right decision.

So here I am sitting on the internet looking up every bump and clunk and whine that the car makes, self-diagnosing every single awful thing that could be wrong with the car. I'm convincing myself that the dealer will come back and say ""Yeah, we told you we'd give you $X for the trade-in, but we really are going to give you $0."" (Dealer provided a trade-in value without seeing it). 

And I know this isn't rational. I'm getting rid of the car because I'm not going to spend the money to fix it. The car is at the point where shit starts to go majorly and expensively wrong. And I'm certainly not going to basically overhaul the car to get a couple thousand extra dollars in trade-in. But as soon as I convince myself of all of this, I see/hear a new thing and start the whole process over.

But this is only a symptom of a bigger problem. If I'm not worrying about the car, it's my cat (he's got a chronic illness), my financial solvency, the fact that I think I spend too much on groceries (but hate cooking), my health/teeth, my job (no reason to worry, they love me), my (non-existent) love life...it goes on and on and on. 

I'm tired. "

68,0.9716665516577829,0.028333448342253313,0.127,0.739,0.134,"Last year I entered college out of state. I have had longstanding problems dealing with depressive episodes and moderate social anxiety. When I got there, the anxiety and depression intensified greatly. On the surface, I was successful; I joined a fraternity, made friends, and aced 20 units of classes. But in reality I felt like I didn't have the support network to maintain meaningful relationships. I also had a roommate I didn't particularly care for, and as someone who was already very introverted and anxious, it was very difficult to ever feel calm considering that there were ALWAYS people around, even in the library. I had difficulty fostering my passions like playing guitar and writing because I felt that I could never do them without the privacy of my own space. A lot of times I would just lie in bed with headphones on and listen to music and pretend that nothing was there. I went to counseling for several months, which helped, but only depressed me further when I was cut off by the university and referred to an outside source. I visited a psychiatrist, who gave me general health tips and told me to get over the counter lithium. I didn't try it out of health concerns and reading about the risk of kidney problems online.

I decided to transfer back to go to a state university. I'm already so much happier now that I'm back home for the summer. I still sometimes feel very depressed, but it's mostly subsided compared to what I went through last year. I can just spend my days indoors drawing or playing guitar or reading. It's great. I hang out frequently with a few of my closest friends whenever it strikes me.

The problem is that while the depression went away, the anxiety didn't. It's hard for me to ask anyone outside of my 3 closest friends to hang out. Even replying to emails or sorting out my affairs for enrollment at my new university gives me intense anxiety spells. There are days when I can't leave the house because of the fear of having to ask someone if they want to get lunch. These aren't strangers either; these are some of my best friends for years. The problem is either A) big group gatherings, even if they are all friends, or B) individual meetups with people who I am only okay friends with. Either one of those scenarios results in me making a million excuses and then staying home. It's not even that I say no, it's that sometimes I just get so anxious I can't even reply to a text message inviting me to hang out. I haven't seen some of my best friends all summer out of this anxiety. Today, I was invited to one of my friends' birthday gatherings. I'm trying so hard to get the courage to show up. But I can already anticipate some of them asking me where I've been all summer, or what happened that made me transfer universities and I have no idea what I'll say. I'm still trying to decide if I should go, so if you have any advice on that end, let me know. I've always had this anxiety, but back in high school it was only mild to moderate. Ever since last year, it's been severe and never slowed down. I'm wondering if I should seek medications from a psychiatrist again, at least so I can get it under control in these types of situations and learn how to function again. I have no idea how these medications work or if it's worth starting up during a transition period like the new few weeks when I start classes. I'm honestly a little afraid of going back to classes in a couple of weeks; my anxiety might prevent me from getting help from others in my classes, or making friends at my new school. Any thoughts of advice?

tl;dr -- Got over depression, but social anxiety has intensified to the point where I can't leave the house, which I'm worried is going to make me more depressed. Advice?

Edit: One thing I'd like to add that I was just thinking about. I gave up drinking and smoking pot. It wasn't doing me any favors for either my anxiety or depression, and I was getting sick of feeling shitty because of it. My friends, however, didn't, and have very much ramped up their alcohol and weed consumption over the past year. Now every moderately sized social gathering seems to have drinking or smoking at the center of it. I don't have any problem with people drinking or smoking in a relaxed environment, but it's a little alienating for me to always be sober at these gatherings. I guess that's the nature of college though."

I have posted a couple times in this sub and elsewhere about my issues with anxiety, etc. I started seeing a psychologist/therapist in March for couples therapy with my partner for reasons I've posted about previously and also meet with her individually to work on things I'd like to work on about myself. Namely, my irritability, anxiety, and moodiness. I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything. 

It's ""only"" been 5.5 months since I started talk therapy and trying CBT. I am very aware of what a lot of my issues are, and am aware of why I have these issues, which is more than I started with. In that regard, talk therapy has helped. 

On the other hand, I have not had much success actually altering my behaviors that are symptoms of my issues. I still have unexplained anxiety, and try to diagnose why I am feeling anxious, but most of the time I cannot. For example, a couple weeks ago, I was driving to a department store to purchase a new set of cooking pans. I was calm, happy, etc. Out of nowhere, I just felt overwhelmingly anxious. I asked myself why. Was it because of traffic? No, it wasn't. Was it because I was worried I was going to overspend? No, I had the means to make my purchase. I was unable to figure out where the anxiety came from, and all I could do was simply wait it out. My irritability is a smidgen better, but not much. Small, petty things still make me angry/tense/irritable, and my temper flares up. A lot of times, I can't catch myself before my temper flares up to figure out why I'm so tense or irritable and to consciously talk myself down from it before I react externally (usually getting terse or angry with my partner). I am also still having problems with my mood in general. It varies greatly from day to day. Sometimes I am happy. The next day I could be sad or tense for literally no reason. I'm tired of the variance and unpredictability. 

At this point, I feel like I know myself well enough that I realize what my issues are and why I have them, but I also know that they are so deeply ingrained in myself that I don't think talking about them by itself is going to help. I would really like to ask my therapist about medication, but I'm scared. I'm scared that she will say she doesn't recommend it. I don't want to be the way that I am anymore, and I don't think I can change myself without the help of medication. I don't want to stop therapy, but I don't think it's enough. I'm also scared of the potential side effects. I already struggle with weight, and I don't want to gain weight. I don't want to lose my sex drive, etc. I don't want to become numb. My boyfriend is on SSRIs for his depression, and he has the common side effects, and has tried different medications, but eventually just settled on one that made his mood feel the best, regardless of the side effects.

Does anyone who's gone through anything like this have any advice or words of encouragement? "

However recently I've noticed that my overall anxiety level increases sometimes and that I still feel not my normal self since I started having issues with anxiety over a year ago. The doctors, mental health professionals, and a psychiatrist that I've spoken to have all recommended that I increase the dosage of my medication as they believe that changing my medication is the only solution to me getting better.

I'm quite worried about this for several reasons. One is that my anxieties have centered around whether or not I'm in a ""normal"" state of mind and if I still have control over my thoughts and emotions. And I also have anxieties about psychoactive substances like my medication having control over my mind and making me unable to exercise free will over my thoughts and emotions and instead making me into someone that is unhappy but still functional in society. Another worry that I have is that changing the dosage may make my mental health and mood much worse to the point where I lose control of my mind and/or become actively suicidal.

So I'm just curious as to other people's experiences regarding dosage change on this medication. Although I know that my mental health could be much worse than it is right now and I'm still able to function somewhat normally, I'm terribly worried that I will lose all of this if I follow the recommendations of others and increase my dosage."

I went to my DR and basically said I didn't like the high/crash constant pill popping of xanax and wanted something that I could take in the morning and be good for...a while. Keep in mind, I've never taken SSRIs as I don't feel I have a chemical imbalance, but mostly that I am under a lot of pressure most of the time and get overwhelmed, not depressed so much.

I got a precription for Klonopin 1MG twice a day (I only use it either 1 MG per day or .5, I just like being overprescribed so that I don't have to pay my psychiatrist each month or if I forget to make an appt I don't run out). As well as some xanax for breakthrough anxiety as needed.

I have to say that I'm really liking the klonopin. Here's my breakdown as I see it, and again, this stuff works totally different for different people and I'm not a doctor.

Xanax (alprazolam):

Pros-

* Great for breakthrough anxiety attacks
* Great for knocking yourself out on a airplane, although there will be a hangover
* Fast acting with a bit of a rush to know its gonna be okay
* Great to keep in your pocket to ward off anxiety because you know you can diffuse it
* If you smoke trees or do psychadelics, invaluable for getting you out of a freakout

Cons

* Very short acting, meaning re-dosing often and riding a bit of a roller coaster
* Very tough on memory, even .5 mg means I might get some brownout retrograde amnesia about what I did the previous day while on it.
* Makes my stomach feel kinda weird, like empty and just a little uncomfortable
* I don't drink much, but be careful with booze around xanax

Klonopin (clonezepam):

Pros-

*  Don't feel medicated, just feel rather normal and somewhat more confident, good for social anxiety
*  The long acting properties means you don't think about it which (if you have an addictive personality) means you just kinda take it occasionally, but there's no reason to be popping these more than once or twice a day (morning and night is a popular regiment)
*  Takes less than an hour to kick in, don't really notice it
* Great for productivity, doesn't cloud thinking in smaller doses and lowers inhibitions in a good way.
* Cuts off anxiety at its source, just seems to stop the worrying cycle
* Takes the edge of smoking trees without totally killing your buzz
* Nice warm feeling and relaxing
* Less amnesia
* Easier to get off of as it is longer lasting and tapers itself nicely

Cons

* Not great for instant panic situations, although you'll have less of them.
* Not very useful recreationally (yay!)

Having been using it for a few weeks now, I really really like it and how it helps me be the person I knew I should be. Meditation and talk therapy are also part of my regiment, but this is one medicine change I've been very happy with.

I find the strength to be somewhat comparable, but to me 1mg xanax feels like 1.5-2mg of Klonopin.

Best of luck out there, it's going to be okay.

I write really very eclectically, so I apologize if my  train of thought is not an easy one to follow. It's hard sometimes to sort feels.

I've been chronically depressed for about 8 years, with a rather severe anxiety disorder.

For years, I assumed the depression was the major problem, that the anxiety was just a part of it, I hardly even saw it as anxiety. When I was in college, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and at that point, I felt like someone had taken all my years of sorrow and just told me they were irrelevant, and that it was just anxiety. I had become so protective of my depression. It had and has made me who i am &amp; ultimately, I liked that person, and she wouldn't have existed without that depression and the anxiety. I know they didn't say 'just anxiety', but that was what it felt like, since I had no personal  conscious experience with it yet. My sad had been dismissed, I had to rethink a lot of things. But with a new look at my issues, and the awareness of my anxiety, I really saw what I had been going through, how persistent, and hellish and how somatic my anxiety and my depression had been. I remembered anxiety attacks, I remembered feeling helpless and just crazy, a little. But now, I could focus on that, I could focus on it because I knew what it was.

I have anxiety attacks sporadically. Sometimes I get them once or more a day, every day, sometimes once a week, sometimes once a month, sometimes every few days. Recently, I had gone 4 months without one severe enough to require my medication, I was really proud of that. The key was that I was with someone who made me feel valued, safe, comfortable, and happy. That's not something you can prescribe though, and it's something I was ridiculously lucky to find. Today, that changed, I woke up with an anxiety attack that didn't let up for hours on end. It hurt, I cried, I hyperventilated, I continued to cry, my mind snowballed everything out of proportion, and I couldn't speak anymore. The meds didn't help that time, I just walked into walls a lot and felt wobbly woozy.

I kind of looked back today, at what my anxiety has been like

I know many of you, like myself, know you're not alone in what you go through. It doesn't change anything. It's your anxiety, all I can do is be supportive and empathetic, and if you need me, I'll help. I don't know your anxiety, I don't know how deep it digs, how easily it gets triggered, and I don't know what else is at place, and where your mind takes you. 

It's my anxiety, it's mine and you might understand anxiety, but you can't feel mine. Telling me everyone goes through this makes me feel like my problems aren't mine anymore, that they're the problems of the rest of the world, and I am helpless to change them.

When I'm anxious, I knit.
When I'm anxious, I listen to rainy mood and Yann Tiersen REALLY LOUD.
When I'm anxious, I drink tea.
When I'm anxious, I do my make up.
When I'm anxious, I might need a hug.
When I'm anxious, don't hug me unless I ask, you might make it worse.
When I'm anxious, I burn white sage
When I'm anxious, I eat chocolate really slowly, I let it melt on my tongue, tiny piece after tiny piece.
When I'm anxious, I roll my eyes at myself and try to laugh at how hysterical I look.
When I'm anxious, I remember that I have managed to get through so many other attacks.
When I'm anxious, don't fucking tell me to stop being anxious.
When I'm anxious, I want to help people who are anxious, because it feels so alone, having an anxiety attack.
When I'm anxious, I dive heart first into books.

I'm lucky enough to have someone who is supportive of me, and who tries to help me through it, but that's not most people. 

Thank you, /r/Anxiety, I know you've already helped me."

My mother is having anxiety/panic attacks.  I’ll try to keep it short.  She had an ear infection and the doctor gave her a prescription for hydrocodone but told her to use it sparingly because it is addictive.  Because she didn’t want to get addicted she then decided to use Klonopin for the pain in her ear instead.  (Yes, we know this was now a mistake.)  She was using the Klonopin for 2 weeks when she started feeling heaviness on her chest and that lead to panic attacks.  The doctor prescribed Zoloft 100 mg which made her feel awful and then Lexapro 10mg which also made her feel awful.  

She went to a new doctor.  This new one had her continue taking the Klonopin 0.5 mg three times a day and added propranolol to help with the heaviness in the chest.  They checked out her heart and it was fine.  Then she was switched over from Klonopin to Ativan 0.5 mg three times a day to help with the nausea she was experiencing.  She felt like “an elastic band that was stretched and then plucked” so they started her on Buspirone 30 mg a day.  This seemed to help a little.  Then they upped it to 45 mg a day and she had extreme nausea.  She can’t eat any food and only has protein like shakes for the past 5 days.  

They cut it back to 30 mg three days ago and the last three days have been hell.  She feels the most anxiety that she has ever felt and would do anything to get the pain to stop.  She is not suicidal, reports no depression and I am keeping a very close watch on her.

My questions:

What is happening?

The only meds she is on now is Buspirone 30mg and Ativan 0.5 mg three times a day.

Are these meds making her nauseas or is it her “nerves”?

She has tried Zofran, which didn’t work, phenegran, and reglan which both had “twitching” as a side effect.  She takes Benadryl which helps a little.  

Is she now addicted to the Ativan?

Does she need a different anti anxiety med?

I know that no one wants make medical advice without having more information but I really could use some guidance here.

Current Meds: Buspar 30 mg, Ativan 0.5 mg, Benadryl 50 mg 

Thank you so much in advance!

80,0.9941749645678133,0.005825035432217687,0.16,0.763,0.077,"Hi. I'm a 29 year old male who has suffered from varying degrees of anxiety for as long as I can remember. It used to be social anxiety, but once I got into my late teens and more comfortable it really became just constant worrying. Looped thoughts, time wasted spent obsessing over uncontrollable variables while pressing issues are ignored... That kind of thing. I really seemed to have gotten a grip of everything to the point that I had started to forget what anxiety even felt like. Then I went from a steady relationship to a somewhat fast-paced and chaotic dating life.

The one thing that absolutely turns my world inside out is dating. Something about the uncertainty involved with dating really cripples me emotionally. I spent most of my teenage years into my early twenties either in committed relationships or having casual sex.

An example would be with a girl I've been seeing for about a month now. She seems to be really into me. We always have a great time. If she doesn't respond to a text message, anxiety completely cripples me. Why didn't she respond? What did I say? Basically worst case scenario obsessing. I'm not a super alpha male type, but I'm fairly confident and don't think these thoughts are consistent with how I normally carry myself.

I can recognize that this is irrational and I don't do anything stupid (other than obsessing over it) like text her 1,000 times. When I'm dating, rather than in a committed relationship this type of thing really cripples me. I don't do as well at work, I let everyday things slide because I'm obsessing over little things.

Another thing is when I have to make plans. For some reason I'm obsessed over what I come up with as if it's going to be awful and ruin everything. Again, I know that's irrational and I'll force myself to just come up with something, but when I'm experiencing these things it's all I can focus on. My thoughts loop over the same thing again and again. If I'm seeing someone and we have established plans in the future this crippling anxiety immediately stops. I mean it completely goes away the very second plans are established.

There is not a single other thing I can think of that brings this out in me. Just dating. I feel like I could be told to learn a new language and give a 15 minute speech in that language on a subject I know nothing about with a gun to my head and I would feel less anxious.

Can anyone relate to this at all? Am I just insane? I'm considering going to see a psychologist about anxiety meds, but it seems so weird to me that dating is the only thing I can think of that brings this out in me. Any input would be appreciated.

**TL;DR Thought I had control of my anxiety, but realized when I'm dating it cripples me when communicating and making plans. Considering meds.**"

I was diagnosed with IgA Nephropathy, which is an autoimmune kidney condition 8-9 years ago (I'm 26 now). Thank God it has been mild for a long time after being medicated after my initial (severe bout), and my kidneys have been in stable condition. Several doctors have told me that I can live a long, ""normal"" life with this condition, but it doesn't change the fact that I can't live a 100% normal life, and it will get harder as I get older, and that I may not live as long as I could potentially.

I've posted previously on this board about bouts of prostatitis and stomach pains that I've had in the past that would last for about a week or so, which in themselves have caused me significantly distress thinking I had cancer or some other auto-immune disease. During my last semester abroad in graduate school, I was living independently, long-distance with my girlfriend, taking 9 courses in school, and was given news before arriving abroad that my kidney condition, although stable, was acting up a bit, but not enough for him to say I definitely needed medication. In panic, I tried to contact my specialist before I left, only to be told that I should go see a psychiatrist/therapist instead. I felt discarded. I saw a couple docs while I was living on my own, and was prescribed benzos for anxiety (first ativan, then klonazepam). I took about 20 or so doses during my time there, when I felt I needed it. I also increased my paxil from 20 mg to 25 mg, which wasn't stabilizing me, until finally I gave in to 30 mg at the tail end of the semester.

Those 4 months were hell, and passed. It was 2 weeks of complete hell and existential crisis, followed by two weeks of relative normalcy. This process repeated the entirety of the semester. I went to visit my girlfriend in Japan after the semester for 3 and a half weeks, and I even had a bit of anxiety for four or so days there over some joint pain I was convinced was gout, an auto-immune disease, or kidney problems (I did take some benzos on the plane). However, I started feeling the 30 mg shift (either that or I really was just enjoying myself to the point that I felt very comfortable and could care less about my condition). I made the decision I wanted to move down to 25 mg when I was in Japan again. This was a horrible mistake.

As soon as I came back home (Toronto), I was happy to see my family, to give them souvenirs, to show them my pictures, to unpack. I ended up catching a mild flu that lasted about 48 hours, but it was enough to drive me back into a health crisis. And here I am. I've left the house ONCE since arriving 5 days ago, and I'm lost my will to live. 

I've RE-realized again that my condition is something I cannot escape from, and that it doesn't get better from here, it can only go down. I am now serious with this girl, we are truly in love with eachother, and I'm planning to get married with her in a year's time. However, I fear so much that she won't put up with my anxiety, and won't put up with my health problems if they are to worsen. I love her so much that I don't want her to have a hard life. Because of this, I pity myself. I hate myself for having this problem. I feel like I should just get this all over with and die. Why do I have to go through this long, slow process of losing an organ, and dragging the person I love most along with me?

I don't know what the future holds. I don't know what advances technology will lead, but I wish I was ignorant about my condition having anxiety and all. If I didn't have anxiety, perhaps knowledge of my condition would help because I could be proactive without worrying. But right now I'm proactive to the point that it's working against me - the entirety of my day goes to thinking and worrying about my condition, what will happen in the future - all largely negative in nature. 

Am I the only one going through this torment? I feel like it. I feel like all of you have healthy, functioning bodies, but are suffering from the same mental illness as I. You have the luxury to worry about things that aren't life/death, although they may feel like it. My anxiety revolves around my LIFE. I feel like I'm dying because that possibility ACTUALLY exists, it is not an impossibility. CBT uses risk analysis, that doesn't work with me because of my condition. 

I really just want to meet someone who understands me, who can relate to what I'm going through. I want someone to tell me that everything is going to be alright, because they themselves have been in that situation or one similar and SURVIVED...

I suffer from social anxiety and have tried multiple medications for this but they all failed (I am currently prescribed 100mg lamictal &amp; 30mg adderall which I have been on for years) but I never tried benzos until yesterday when I was prescribed .5mg of clonazepam from my psychiatrist. 

I took my first .5mg dose yesterday to see how I would react to it (as opposed to first taking it when I am forced to socialize). I woke up feeling very calm... I'm usually very anxious upon starting my day. and throughout the day I also noticed I felt very mellow. in a good way. 

I took my second dose today except I broke it in half. so I took .125mg at around 5:30pm &amp; the second .125mg at around 7:00pm. 

I still feel mellow but I keep wondering whether or not this will work this weekend (forcing myself to leave my cave and socialize ha ha). I want to be able to just be okay in a social setting. even if I don't interact with anyone.... haha if that even makes any sense...

At this point, it isn't out of the question that I could be fired although it isn't a certainty by any means. 

But if I do get fired, this will make 2 jobs in 2 years that I've lost because of my anxiety. I'm in a high stress job (lawyer) and my boss is trying to help but she gets frustrated with my lack of judgement or insight into our work. What she fails to mention is that everyone else in the department has multiple years there, I've been there 13 months. But if she knows that, it doesn't seem to matter. I'm terrified I'm going to lose this job, and I will feel absolutely worthless if I do. Add to that the guilt I will feel because my wonderful girlfriend would have to pay all of our bills, and I'm pretty much a wreck most days. I hate feeling this way, and I hate knowing that the people I work with see me as incompetent or high strung, or just an idiot.  Bottom line, I'm frustrated and I'm scared. 

Sorry for rambling. Just had to get that out. "

With her panic attacks, I know to comfort her, cuddle her, tell her it's okay, that she can get through this. Correct me if I'm wrong.
But with her visions, hallucinations, I'm not sure what to call them, she starts to get violent and claws at her neck and swings her arms about. I can say things to her to calm her down, but not hold her because she'll hit me.


What do I do when she has one of these episodes? Also, if someone has a name for what these hallucinations are, could you tell me? She imagines she's in a war, hears gunshots, loud screaming. Sometimes she feels like her neck is being squeezed, and feels like she can't breath?

I haven't happy cried in a long long time, I think since before I even realised something was wrong in my head.

I'm three days removed from a minor surgery, am experiencing very, very little pain and actually holding up pretty well, but my anxiety has kind of returned because of the down time. 

I had not slept very well the past few nights, and this morning I woke off of 5 hours of sleep to go to a doctor appointment. I was feeling very, very lathargic and tired. 

When I got home I immediately tried to go back to sleep and definitely felt a little bit of anxiety (heart beat, kind of high strung, etc) but started dozing out. 

You know that moment when you are almost alseep but not quite and you feel pretty damn good? Well, all of a sudden I kept getting these like...adrenaline shocks...or something. My arms and legs kind of felt like they were going numb...and then I felt this rush in my head, that included somewhat of a noise, and I popped awake.

I have experienced something very similar once before, but I was very hungover and I think was having some alcohol withdrawals. This was not as frightening, but more of just my body seemingly trying to jolt me awake...as if my brain didn't want to fall asleep. I have not taken any medication other than Acetaminophen, which has no side effects.

It happened twice in about a five minute span, but instead of freaking out I just talked myself down and stubbornly said ""YOU ARE GOING TO GET SOME DAMNED SLEEP!"" so I made sure I didn't get up until I feel asleep. 

Well, I did, but my dreams were awful because my dream was me panicking! This is normal...I've had this before, and it sucks because you feel like sleep isn't a save haven...in fact it can be worse because the dreams can let anxious thoughts manifest themselves as perceptions that all of the terrible thoughts that come with anxiety are real. This dream I was going blind, which was a major fear I had as a kid. 

I'm actually awake and pretty calm right now, but this blows. I know I've always fought off my bad ruts of anxiety and come out with flying colors. Before this surgery I was sleeping great, waking up feeling awesome and was anxiety free for about 80% of the time. 

These setbacks make me feel depressed, or as if I might be losing my mind. I know not to Google because people create the most horrifying scenarios. I want to believe this is just some bad anxiety.

I have been suffering from anxiety and it has been pretty severe. I lost my dream job, and ended up working at a job I hated which only made my anxiety worse, and I ended up losing that job as well. It was devastating and my anxiety became so severe that I couldn't talk on the phone, leave my house, or visit with family. I finally was able to get to a therapist with the help of my mom dragging me out of the house but I have only had one visit so far and the progress is going to be slow because I'm also suffering from PTSD. My best friend is studying to get his Phd in homeopathic medicine and has been using me as his case study. He did research and consulted with a homeopathic doctor and decided on an herbal formulation that he thought would help me. I was hesitant because I am a nurse so I'm trained in western medicine and don't have much knowledge of herbal remedies. My anxiety got so bad, and I shut everybody out for a few days, even my best friend when he was trying to help me. He showed up at my door with the herbal formula and asked me to give them a try. I took them that night, and for the first time in I cant even remember how long, I was able to lay down in bed and go to sleep without anxiety or insomnia. I slept beautifully that night. It has been 5 days now since I started taking them and although I still have social anxiety, I no longer have the constant nagging anxiety that was haunting me before. I look forward to bedtime now and I get delicious sleep. I am in a good mood, smiling, and laughing and making jokes. I no longer have the nausea, diarrhea, headaches and everything else that came along with the anxiety. I'm starting to feel like myself again. I highly recommend this formula! It is called Bupleurum and Dragon Bone. The brand I am using is made by Jing Herbs. I never in a million years I thought I would get relief from herbs. I hope that after reading about my experience others will be willing to try it too. I really think it can help you and give you the headstart you need to start feeling better. What surprised me most is how fast it worked. I felt a difference after one dose! I still plan on going to therapy and I now am optimistic that with these herbs and therapy I can overcome my anxiety.

But I'm fucking miserable. I'm homesick, which is making my anxiety worse. I've never had trouble sleeping before, but last night was the second in 2 weeks that I've spent awake the entire night with my heart pounding, knowing I'd be fine if I could just go home or if I wasn't alone. 

I was seeing a great therapist back home, but obviously had to quit seeing her when I left this past August. I got so desperate that I had an appointment with a therapist on campus here, on my birthday last Friday. I have another one next Friday. I've always been anti-meds (because taking medication makes me anxious; I'm always afraid I'll be allergic to it, or that I won't be able to handle the side effects), but right now all I want is for someone to hand me a pill that will let me sleep and feel ""normal"" for a while, whatever normal is. I hate it here. I want to go home. My girlfriend is 3 hours away, so that's not much help either. I'm doing well in my classes, but I can't handle the pressure of 3 research projects that are all due within the same week in December. 

I'm such a lucky person. I was created by two caring people who worked their asses off to raise me and send me to good schools. I had little trouble in high school and college, and graduated cum laude with my Bachelor's in English this past May.

But I feel like I was cursed to be miserable. To never be able to truly embrace my life and the opportunities I've been given. 

I just want to go to sleep and wake up and be okay. Really, I'd settle for the mild depression I've gotten used to for the past 20 years. I don't need to be happy. I just need to be ""fine"". My ""normal"". But I feel like I can't even get to that anymore. It's all just getting worse."

I've had Generalized Anxiety for as long as I can remember. I'm 21 (M) now, but as a child, all the way through school, and presently, my anxiety is and has been so bad that I've found it nearly impossible to function as a normal person. The worst part about it is that my anxiety and stress does not and has not ever gone away, even for a split second. I'm completely and totally exhausted because I honestly do not know what it feels like to be relaxed. I want, more than anything in the entire world, to simply be able to be comfortable. Even when I'm alone in my bed, I'm just stressed out of my mind.

I don't have panic attacks or have my anxiety triggered by anything because it's already there in the first place. It never goes away. I can't even seem to understand what it is that I'm stressed or anxious about. I'm not particularly worried about anything, I don't have an irrational fear of people or going outside or anything like that, I'm simply tremendously uncomfortable at all times.

I've gone to various doctors and gone through numerous medications to no avail. I've also gone to a therapist, and that had no outcome other than strengthening my preconception that talking to a random person that happens to have a degree in the same way that I've talked to dozens of others in the past wouldn't do anything for me.

I really don't know what to do anymore. I'm totally exhausted as a result of my discomfort, and I'm fairly certain that there's nothing that can help me other than finding a way to overcome it in my own mind which, as I'm sure most of you in this subreddit know, can be nearly impossible for someone in this situation.

I've been down this road before and hated the cure almost as much as the disease. Everytime they medicate me I gain 1,000 lbs. my weight is a major factor in my anxiety and depression and I've been trying hard to lose it since the last time I was medicated (and it's been so f*cking hard.)

I need to be armed with information about what to ask for when the topic of medication comes up. What's my best bet for something that won't cause me to blow up like a balloon?

I am hiAnxiety, I am 20 years old, have done a plethora of drugs, most of the time to self-medicate my horrible social anxiety, and take suboxone for opiate maintenance and energy and klonopin. I only take the klonopin 4-5 times a week.

Now, this has been a decent combo and I am thankful for the prescription, however it wasn't enough for me to actually get out of the house and do things. I had little motivation and was scared to even go outside or drive. My social phobia has prevented me trying to achieve a lot of dreams, instead if has let me become isolated and watch netflix and play hearthstone all day.

Now, me and my therapist and my psychiatrist talk alot, and we agreed that a stimulant of some sort would be beneficial for me to become more extroverted and talk to people. I got prescribed 90 20mg IR pills for a month, which is 60mg of Adderall per day. Now, I know what you are thinking. Who starts on a dose of adderall that large? Well no worries, I have only taken about 10-20mg and plan to not go overboard. I mean, my insurance covers it so why not get free pills?

So, it's been day 2 on adderall for me. I have been feeling more motivated and talkative. The crash was kind of bad yesterday though and I threw up because I took too much, around 30mg... 

My question is, do you think adderall can help me overcome social anxiety? It isn't just a tool for ADHD/ADD, I don't have either. I have done lots of research on forums and many people say it has helped, and I think I can be one of those people. Benzos lower my anxiety but make me feel foggy and not sociable. Adderall can do the opposite. Combined, I think it will be perfect.

What do you guys think? Please only answer if you are open-minded and have had experience or know someone w/ experience for adderall as a medication for anxiety and being a more productive, better person."

I am dating this guy and do not want to take it further with him because I am scared. I have also gone through periods of agoraphobia where I don't leave the house for weeks. It got really bad about 6 months ago when I went to rehab. I had been on klonopin for my insomnia for about 4 years but I became very addicted to it and was on far above the legal dose. I was weaned off of it and over the months I became more and more paralyzed by fear. I have never known anxiety of this caliber ever before in my life until now. I didn't realize how much the klonopin affected how I perceived the world until it was no longer there. I've tried alternative treatments such as biofeedback and other forms of mindfulness, yoga, supplements, etc. Nothing is providing lasting relief. I also see a psychiatrist for psychotherapy every two weeks and he is amazing. He does help some but it's not enough to get through the every day trials I deal with in regards to my anxiety. I asked him if he could prescribe an SSRI or something to take the edge off just for now but he refuses because I have been to rehab. It's frustrating because I am not asking for a medication I could potentially become addicted to, I am just asking for something to improve my functioning. I am miserable.

I have been with my girlfriend for a few years now and it has been amazing. She is a wonderful person who I admire greatly and wouldn't change her for the world. But there is one thing I feel helpless about sometimes and it is her anxiety. It isn't a huge deal for me, and it is not a daily crippling struggle for her. She is still able to complete her days when she is feeling the weight of the world on her shoulders and I can't imagine how hard it is to struggle with daily tasks while suffering from anxiety and continue to push through the day.

This being said I sometimes feel lost in my ability to help. I am not an clueless and can sometimes tell she is holding back all these feelings and emotions cause I can imagine she doesn't want to feel like she is burdening me with her life problems. WHICH IS NOT THE CASE AND I HAVE TOLD HER THAT lol....those pesky over thinking minds :)  As someone who has no prior experience with this situation I do what in my mind is the best thing I can think of. I put myself in her shoes and try to treat her as if I was going through these problems. I motivate her and give her the best advice as I possibly can on how I deal with stressful situations. I hold her when it gets to bad and tell her it will be okay. I comfort her as best as I know how and it usually tends to deescalate the situation and everything calms down.

However, sometimes I feel trapped in a corner when these situations happen. Since I have no form of anxiety, I often run out of things to say and it doesn't help that sometimes the triggers are repeated experiences. I don't like feeling like I'm a broken record with advice when I run out of things to say or do. It can feel like I'm a doctor giving Motrin for every gripe, ache, and pain no matter what. 

I have told her to find more hobbies and continuously harp on exercise as a huge stress fighter. Because I don't want her to always rely on the meds and only take them when she needs them, but I have already told her that she needs to have them with at all times in case it gets too bad. In perfect world I would love to see her off meds and be able to not be bothered by all these things but I know that might not ever happen, which is okay. I am a her shoulder and open ear and I just want to have good advice to reply back with....I don't want her to feel like she has to hold things in, or go to other friends before coming to me. And I know that not all things she will talk to me about and I am okay with that too lol. 

Idk I guess I'm wondering if there are other people out their in my situation that have advice or things that they have found that help.

I am attending a college and it was Sunday night and all that night i had anxiety because on Monday there was a quiz. I studied the chapter as required and ended up still getting a D on the quiz. Last semester i scored so bad on a English test i almost rammed my car into the side barrier of the freeway that is how bad this is effecting me.
I have no idea what is actually wrong because ever sense i have had depression it seems like my academics have been totally horrid. No matter how much studying i put in it seems to not show. Therefore i recently changed my majors as i would not attend nursing school with the grading i am getting. Don't get me wrong i don't mind Computer Science but the fact that this has been a long dilemma i just ugh.. I currently take depression medicine and am going to talk to my Doctor for anxiety medicine.
Furthermore, this week i was going to have a test in mathematics on Thursday but luckily it was pushed back to next week praying hands. Often times i can't even bring myself to go into the math lab to study because of anxiety and the social pressure. My teacher has said (In general to the class) it's a confidence thing and that students need to build their confidence and practice to succeed but i feel when i do study i am confident and then boom when the test comes and i think i did great it was actually pitiful. Somehow i manage to pull out decent scores on finals.
Not to mention lately i haven't even been able to work correctly. Walking seems like a normal thing for people to do naturally but now it's getting to the point of being ridiculous. Today when i was walking i had a loss of balance.. A few hours ago i had family come from out of town (parents relatives) and well i was feeling very awkward as if they were judging me. At one point my mother blabbed about me not having a job and the lady (aunt) had this look as if it was odd that i am in college with no job. My mother made this excuses that she doesn't want me to have a job and to focus on school but the reality is i cant even muster up to turn in a application with 0 experience page empty.
Any recommendations for improvement are greatly appreciated."

I am currently conducting some research (For my Postgraduate MSc HPaB Psychology degree) on Depression/Anxiety and I would be very, very grateful if members currently taking medications would take a moment to complete the survey in the link below. 

The broad goal of my research is to examine the different classes of anti-depressant medications in relation to side effects, specifically addressing the severity level, type and tolerability of side effects in relation to medication BNF classification (the pharmacological body which classifies antidepressants into categories depending on the primary proposed mechanism for how the medication works). 

The link is: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/3933B5L

Again, I am very grateful to those who are willing to contribute the 5-10minutes it will take to complete the survey, an introductory page; disclosure and debriefing are included within the first and last pages, also an exclusion criteria is presented on the first page (For example, only persons +18 years can participate). 

Thank you again!!!

P.S. Please feel free to forward on the survey link, the higher the amount of responses and the more varied the participants the more robust my research findings will be. - Again, many thanks.

Nick.

I have never been the type to have many friends. Mostly the uncertainty of social experiences has scared me away from them entirely. If you saw me you would never know. A few months back my 2 year relationship with a girl I met in high school and went to college with ended. Had I not been afraid of what the outcome would be I likely would have ended it a year earlier. I have put up with anxiety symptoms for years, but lately that combined with depression or loneliness has had me sleeping in as long as I can, not wanting to face my life as is. There can be hours at a time where I am playing video games with friends and am happy as ever, but any trigger or stray thought to my current state has me shutting off the computer and laying in bed for anywhere from minutes to the rest of the day. Consciously I am well aware I am glad the relationship ended. Yet I cannot keep myself from thinking about the ""what ifs"", and part of me convincing me to be sad for myself over it.  

I am looking for any advice going forward. Personally I have tried to avoid getting medication, as I don't feel risking side effects is worth it. I will look into it if it is thought to really help."

I can't drive, I can barely talk to people without making it awkward, and most importantly I'm an academic failure. I'm enrolled in an online course and I'm almost done. I'm struggling with something normal people would find easy even with the correct dosage of medication.

She and i had hooked up during the senior summer before i went abroad for a gap year and study. While i was there, she played me for 8 months and left me expecting to be a father that would be giving his child up for adoption. Low and behold it was all a ""practical joke"" and i was left with no explanations and some pretty severe mental distress and trauma that persisted for the next few years. I have suffered from physical anxiety attacks, cyclical depression for the past several years, but this experience elevated it all to a whole new level. It led to the general inability to trust someone in a relationship without inuring the aforementioned issues.

It has been almost 5 years since i have been able to trust someone enough to pursue a relationship. Previous attempts left me suffering with physical anxiety attacks that were an almost daily occurrence. Recently though, i have been able to move beyond those terrors and to ask a gal out for a date. She and i have been together a little more than a month and it was fun, but now she is incredibly distant.

She and i are going to talk next week once we are back from spring break, but in the mean time i am left with my thoughts and fears. It is absolutely terrifying me.

While i know that i'm probably freaking out about nothing, my previous experiences are weighing on my mind. I am terrified that something is wrong, not so much that the relationship might not be working out, but rather that she might be pregnant. I am having flashbacks to the last time before i went abroad and its tearing me apart. I dont know if this is something i can go through again. Even though the first time was all a lie, for 8 months it was very real.

It terrifies me that after receiving counseling and being treated for the physical anxiety that it could be happening all over again. My first time removing the barriers that i put up to relationships, not allowing myself to focus wholly on work and school, and that it could be happening all over again. I just dont know.
She and i will talk and im sure its nothing, but like i said, i cannot silence my fears. Although my medication has worked great for the past months i have been on it, i can feel the anxiety building and im worried ill suffer another large attack, im terrified.

Currently I am 22 years old. Two years ago I was diagnosed with [Supraventricular Tachycardia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supraventricular_tachycardia) and my cardiologist decided it was serious enough to have an [ablation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter_ablation).

The procedure went well and it wasn't until two months later when started having palpations, skipped and fastened heart beats, ect ect.   
It really started to take it's toll on me. I was so outgoing and carefree before everything happened and now I can't do most of the activities I used to love- out of fear of having anything stated above.

I saw my cardiologist but he's very dismissive. I get it, he deals with people going through heart transplants and major heart problems but to me this is the most important thing happening in my life...the one thing I can't stop thinking about and it's destroying me. He suggested I see some psychologists and whatnot for relaxation techniques. I don't have anything against getting help but I can google ""relaxation techniques"" and find a ton of ideas (plus I do yoga which helps)

Fast forward: I've been on 10MG of Valium for about a year. I take it at various times when I'm anxious or have palpations or fluttering and it doesn't help at all...Unless I have an empty stomach, then it works for about 10 minutes and I go back to feeling anxious and whatnot.  I don't take it everyday. Sometimes I take it a few times a week and other times around once a month. It never helps.

A few months ago I went to the ER with an episode of SVT (which is now an undiagnosed heart condition according to my cardiologist) and after it subsided the doctor noticed I was anxious and gave me a one off dose of Xanax. It helped right away and lasted awhile.

I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow and I'm thinking about switching (obviously with her permission and script) to Xanax.

I'm wondering if anyone else here has had minimal help with Valium and has had help from another medication like Xanax or something alike or if I should just stick to Valium?

For reference I'm female, 22, 5'2ish and 115 pounds. 

**TLDR; Heart problems have given me anxiety. Valium doesn't help and I'm wondering about Xanax.**

I just got out of a relationship where I was being sexually abused. It was very strange, because it's something that went on for years without really being acknowledged.


Well, I'm dealing with the consequences now. Looking back on it I realize how messed up the whole thing was.
I have forgiven him for what he did to me. I don't want to punish him. I just want to heal and for him to get the help he needs. But I know that I have a responsibility in speaking up about what happened, so that he can't get away with doing that to somebody else.


I'm scared of how I'm supposed to approach this. He and I don't speak, and I need it to stay that way. I don't want to call the cops, because I don't want it to have to come to that. I can't tell his friends, because they won't hold him accountable. The only thing I can think of is contacting his parents, because they are the only people who love him enough to make sure he gets help.
Nobody knows about what happened between us.


I don't want to have to shake anybody else's foundation. I don't want his parents to have to look at their son and know what he is capable of. It will break their hearts. 
I also feel pathetic about potentially having to go to that length. He is an adult, and I don't like the idea of having to shake things up with his family. 
He just doesn't understand how sick he is, or the effect that his actions have had on me. He has no idea how much he could hurt someone else if this continues.

Just thought that maybe I should share my story for no reason whatsoever. Perhaps so that others wouldn’t do the same things I am doing now. 

Actually, nothing is too bad. I do have a supportive family, a couple of friends, and I’m studying to become what I’ve always wanted, which is translation from foreign languages. I would never go to a therapist because nothing is bothering me on the inside – or more likely because I don’t want to admit I have any problems speaking to a doctor. It might all be just my imagination, after all. 

I’m 20, male, and I have Cystic Fibrosis, a chronic illness that is incurable and leaves me with a somewhat shorter lifespan than usual, but if I eat all the pills and do all the treatments, it’s going to be alright for quite a bit more years, aside from coughing a lot every single day. I’m living with my Mom, who has sheltered me from most of human interaction on the good grounds of that the more exposure to the outside world I get, the sooner I get ill and the shorter my life is. I’ve never talked to a cashier to buy anything, I’ve never went anywhere outside the house alone with only one or two exceptions I will tell later, I’ve never went to a school to talk with the kids.

I did, however, have three or four good friends in the summer, when Mom and the grandparents were at the summer house, since I was 5 or 6 until around 15. Thanks to CF, my hormones are a little bit off, and the puberty started quite a couple of years later than usual, and my peers mostly used me as a source of toys and an easy target for bullying. One day, they stopped coming to my house for there were other entertaining things, such as flirting and girls and booze and smoking, of all which I didn’t join them. Roughly that time was when I got my first computer and switched from teachers coming home-schooling by foot to teachers coming home in a computer screen. Obviously, I got some friends as a bonus as well.

Now, what’s the problem? The problem is, I’m dead scared to talk to any kind of people I have to talk to. I got a dog to go outside alright, and I was walking him almost every day (except for extremely high or low temperatures, or the sick times), up until some old lady said she didn’t want me or my dog walking anywhere near her cats, which is at the entrance of the house (and that’s a very urban city for you). Then, I never walked with the dog again, except for when Mom agreed to walk with me as well. 

Then, there is the university, which also is going strong through the Internet, and all the fellow students and teachers. I’m both extremely jealous of all them because they talk freely at the lectures and even communicate one another outside of them, and angry at myself that I can’t belong to the group, too, and be the cause of laughter, source of knowledge, or just a general student. A year ago, when the first year started, I talked with everyone at the lectures, and everyone seemed to love me, only that my heart was pounding and my feet and hands were dead cold every time I had to talk, and then, well, I just stopped talking. I'm still going to the lectures, but whenever my name is mentioned, I shut off the computer and just sit there not even feeling awful or guilty that much. I guess that as far as I do the homeworks meeting all the deadlines, they won’t kick me out (I’m still the best student out of the group, as the teachers say), so it’s all good, but I still wish I could be re-plugged into the network of other students again, or something.

I’m not at all concerned about relationships, but, sadly enough, I attracted a very nice guy to myself, and even though he’s great and very caring and passionate, I don’t feel anything back to him. Might be because I’m not gay (but most likely I am, because I’ve never ever talked to girls in my life or felt the need or desire to do so). We talked a lot, and I reciprocated his “I love you”’s and other things because I didn’t know what they really meant. He loves me utterly and completely, and I have no idea what to do about it. Therefore, instead of watching movies or TV series or playing games together there is that same outcome: I stopped talking to him using my voice, and am avoiding talking to him in text, even though I know that’s not fair at all concerning him and how he cares about me.

So, here I am, not talking to anyone but my family and one single best friend, being angry and confused since I can’t find a way to be more talkative and not shy again (even though I am on Atarax, the medicine one doctor prescribed me to use against the anxiety, it doesn’t seem to help much so far). I’m probably not even intelligible and talk rubbish and not what you really want to hear. Oh well, can’t help that. Maybe one day I will ask the doctor if I might have Asperger’s, since my AQ score is way over the top, but I don’t think that will be any soon. I’d better be off living as it is now than talking about myself and what I might feel and what opinions I have on things to any person at all.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 8 years, (since 16 years of age, I'm now 24), and we have been living together for 2 years. After graduating I managed to find a full time, 40 hour a week job to help pay the rent for the two of us.

Her anxiety has gotten so bad that it's meant she's quit university without graduating (in her final year) which means we both have huge student loans to pay off. She can't find a job, she's been looking for just over 3 months, but her anxiety is so bad that she can't physically hand out CVs, answer the phone to strangers or attend interviews. We've tried counselling and medication, but we gradually lost hope in finding a 'cure'. She's currently staying at home 24/7 whilst I'm working, so I'm not sure if there are any jobs that she can do whilst at home. She's perfectly normal when she's at home, but as soon as we leave the house to find a job or go to the doctors she mentally breaks down and becomes very emotional in public, which can get quite embarrassing at times.

I've been supportive of this for years now, but it's gradually getting worse and I can't financially support both of our rent. I'm getting seriously depressed working for the sake of staying alive. The thing is, it's almost contagious, I've found myself being a happy guy to becoming socially awkward and upset a lot. I like to think i'm supportive, I have been the last few years but now I'm doubting our future together because everything is slowly falling apart. I've given her the ultimatum that she has to get a job before Christmas or she has to move out and live with her parents. I love her so much but I can't financially support both of us for much longer without her moving away for a while. I've seriously thought about breaking up with her because I can't handle the situation, but that would make me a weak and guilty person, which is something I can't live with on my conscience. 

I can't have fun or live with my girlfriend anymore, and it's killing me inside. Can anyone give me some advice?

Edit: I just realized that this post seems quite self-centered. I'm not upset because her anxiety is affecting me, but because it's having an adverse affect on our relationship."

I don't even have a target score for either of these tests, but every time I see my scores I feel like I am nothing, but a number. I am that score. My grades don't matter because I'm that score. Everything feels like it is going to fall apart because I didn't score a few points higher and I know that if I did score higher it wouldn't matter because I would feel the same way. My constant desire to improve myself is causing me pain. I was hard on myself about low A's. My transcripts don't even show percentages! Just the letter grade. Straight A's feels like nothing special to me and one B feels like my world is crumbling apart. My family is proud of me. My friends are proud of me. Everyone in my life believes that I'm doing great. Except the only person that needs to believe it, me. Instead of being happy with what I am doing with myself I get myself worked up and when something falls out of place I feel like everything else is falling out of place too. I feel like this is not only my best, but also my worst attribute. Ideally I can make it into only my best, but until I learn how to accomplish that, I am my harshest critic and form my feelings of anxiety through my harsh criticisms of myself how I only see the worst case scenario and never the best.

Thanks for letting me rant. I'm going to try and sleep now.

Side note: I do receive profesional help and was diagnosed with a GAD and given meds just looking for support or someone similar I guess.

TL;DR : I beat myself up over accomplishments probably worth being proud of it and cause myself anxiety by feeling like my world will crumble apart for not being perfect."

122,0.9792686689037485,0.02073133109623981,0.101,0.782,0.117,"Hello I have had these issues for around 5 yrs now. It started as a bad time of the month (cramped and bled everywhere 2 hrs from home and panicked.) I am currently on meds now plus birth control since I believed it was hormonal. Anyways almost became an agoraphobe, but thankfully I don't let my anxiety control me like that. So fast forward to present...I have been good for several years give or take a few lingering anxiety attacks once or twice. (usually lasts like a week or two) and last year it hit me hard again, but it was a really stressful time since both me and my fiance both lost our jobs and money was running out fast. Either way after 6 months of no SSRI's I had to be put back on them (I kind of could not afford them so I decided to quit on my own.) 

Anyways a little over a week ago I got really sick and bedridden for 3 days in which caused my anxiety to sky rocket because I never had to call out of work once (other than earlier this year when I first started due to getting bad attacks and to get put on meds to control them better) and I never sat at home that long before in a looong time either. 

Okay to the point. I kind of think I screwed myself this year because when I get anxiety I get terrified of being home and especially being home alone so I always went out to stores after work and shopped around until a certain time then I would head home. I didn't want it to control me and make me stay home so I always went out, but I think this time I need to try and stay home more often in order to be more comfortable at home. Then on days off go do stuff (what are ya'lls opinions on this?) I have noticed the past two weeks that drinking so much coffee does mess with my anxiety a bit. I always drink it before work and sometimes a few cups at work and maybe half an energy drink. I also was drinking 2 beers a day almost everyday of the week. Now that I quit caffeine I notice that I am calmer although I do miss how hyper it made me and it brought my mood to good lvls. I also decided to quit drinking as much and only during social gatherings or something I might have one beer.

So I guess what I am going at here is that do you guys think it might be a good idea to spend a little more time at home learning more hobbies and bonding with myself better so being bedridden wont do this again? I am scared of becoming an agoraphobic so I always force myself out if I have anxiety attacks in which leads me to being scared of going home.
I am forcing myself to go home after work well after going to the gym so I can learn to not be bored at home. (in which I think being bored is another trigger and with drinking coffee making me hyper and not knowing what to do with myself)

Also I did get my meds changed from citalopram to the generic of zoloft because of the attacks last week. In which I have noticed that citalopram did make me soooo sleepy all the time and so far zoloft only makes me sleepy a little after I take it then I am fine. So theres a plus haha. 

Sorry it was a random post, but I would love to hear some opinions though :) I am okay now although a little zoned out due to the new meds."

Maybe it's this depressing weather. Maybe it's low hemoglobin levels. Maybe it's vitamin deficiency. Maybe it's because my period is about to start. Maybe it's cancer. Maybe it's heart problems.  
I almost fainted in a bus last week (not sure if it was because of anxiety, it felt different, so maybe it was due to hunger or temperature) and now I'm terrified of buses, especially crowded ones. And fainting.   
Sitting through lectures in university has been the hardest thing these days. I can't give you a solid reason why I'm so anxious during lectures. I can't control it, I'm afraid of everything. I guess most of it is health anxiety though.

My girlfriend is in her mid 20s while I'm a couple years older. She moved in with me a couple of years ago. Before moving in with me I knew she had some anxiety problems, but once she moved in I noticed how much worse it really was. She understands that she has more anxiety than usual and I'll put some more details below so you can see it isn't passive every day anxiety that anybody faces. However, she is really afraid to seek professional help. She says her fear is of taking medicine that might make her want to kill herself, but I think it is also the anxiety of going to a doctor that prevents her from going.

She often worries about things that are incredibly unlikely to happen, and is constantly worrying about death (for any reason). Sometimes the reason can be understandable. For example, while driving, another driver may do a near hit and that can scare her, but there are other times which she'll just be afraid of any random thing crashing into our house or that she might suddenly get cancer. If the topic of death ever comes up, more often than not, she will have a panic attack later in the evening. I'll stay up as long as she does, keeping her company and consoling her as best I can.

When we are at home, I always have to make sure she knows where I am or else I'll startle her. If she thinks I'm in the restroom and happens to see me in the living room, she'll scream.

Whenever we do go out, she is often easily irritated at the presence of other people. She is always paying more attention to what other people are doing rather than what we're doing and either worrying about their actions or judging them. I feel like that may be what she does to herself, judging every action she makes.

There are even some days where she'll just be sad and moody all day, crying for no reason. It even gets to a point where she'll just sit on the couch and stare off into space with a blank stare, with tears running down her face. I try to talk to her and console her but she just won't react in any way, no talking or moving or acknowledging my presence. I stay with her though, even just sitting next to her because she usually later tells me that it helps a lot if I'm just there, even if she doesn't react.

However, there are also days when she's in a great mood. She will be happy, excited, and without much worrying. She will be motivated to go do things or continue with some of her hobbies. It really makes me happy when she has her good days and I want to see her like that more often.

To me, all of these are signs of Anxiety and it affects her every day life so I want to help her. Have any of you had friends help you with getting help? What did they do? And how do you think I could help her?

TL;DR How do I convince somebody to seek professional help when they really need it? Also are there any minor herbal things or meditation techniques she can try until I convince her to seek help? Afraid of medicine but not herbs."

My first year of school was great, and I was really excited to come back. But the combination of me having too much work and my realization that college has no meaning or value for me whatsoever (along with a number of other factors) ruined my mind. I was always anxious, sometimes because of something in particular and sometimes for no reason at all.

I was talking with someone who is into herbal remedies, and I eventually ended up buying some holy basil capsules (Organic India). I'd tried St. John's Wort to no effect, so I figured I'd give this a shot, but I had very little faith that it would help.

I was taking two of those capsules twice a day, and a few days after I started, I walked outside, saw that it was a beautiful day, and for the first time in a very long time, I felt absolutely overjoyed. I couldn't stop smiling.

For about the next month, my mood continued to be much higher (though I still had my moments, of course). It didn't really help me to do better in school, but when I messed up, I was able to brush it off and not get upset. I felt grateful to be alive, and nothing could stop me.

Then I started feeling worse. The anxiety began to return, and as it continued I decided to myself that I should stop spending my money on those pills. I figured the effects were probably all in my head anyway. So I stopped.

Things continued to worsen, but I was still functional. At some point last week, I had a lot to do and found myself unable to do any of it. I felt totally paralyzed, and all I could do was sit and cry. I told myself I'd go to therapy the next day (for the first time). In my desperation, I took two capsules. Within an hour, I felt incomparably better. I actually felt *good*. I still wanted to go to therapy the next day, but I felt unable to because I wasn't really upset. So I decided that this time I'd stay on it. It was obviously helping.

Unfortunately, the past two or three days have been the worst, ever. I am a total wreck, really miserable, and I can't seem to do anything, which is just fantastic, seeing as the semester is ending and all the papers are due and exams are beginning. I have made up my mind that tomorrow I am going to go to counseling at my school. Sticking with the holy basil for now, too.

My advice to anyone considering it: give it a shot. I wasn't confident about it at all, but it has definitely helped me a lot. If it works for you, it will be well worth it.

I'm not sure if the return (and subsequent worsening) of my anxiety is a result of becoming tolerant to the medicine. Maybe I'm doing better than I would be without it. I don't know. It does seem to me, though, that when I am in a really terrible state and I take some, I generally feel a lot better within a couple hours.

I think maybe a better idea (at least in my case) would be to take a lower dose (half of what I am taking now) and take more when I'm not feeling okay. It's something that you'd probably have to experiment with to see what helps you.

While my experience has been mixed, I've been able to spend a lot of time feeling really good that I probably otherwise would have spent very upset. So I definitely think people with anxiety should give it a shot!"

I knew it was there i knew i was going to have attacks occasionally and i just accepted it and kept on keeping on. I had good friends, i still do somehow.

And i end up stopping them because it gets really bad, only thing that's helped me in the past is xanax really and most doctors don't want to prescribe that regularly. I know i need professional help, and i want to try counseling but right now sadly my families in a bad place financially and i cant afford to go in at all not even to urgent care to try to get a prescription. I even have insurance but i still cant afford the copay and pills or a psychiatrist. I have no idea what to do anymore. I feel so miserable and tied down by my anxiety and it's gotten to the point where i can hardly see a point anymore.

My SO has anxiety issues, they are something he has dealt with a large portion of his life but for the most part they are more strongly related to stressful situations like his college classes or impending deadlines (even gets a bit worried around anniversary/gift giving times). 

That being said he is often anxiety free in day to day life however he is enrolled in college courses and they will only continue to get harder and more demanding over the next few years so the stress/anxious moments have been cropping up more frequently as of late. We have begun to more seriously discuss medication as an option. 

I would love any experiences from anyone who's SO are now medicated, changes, concerns, positives and negatives to get a really good idea of potential outcomes and expectations from this perspective.

The opinion of the professional was that meds could help, but doing as much natural remedies as I could before turning to them.  And I have; a healthy lifestyle is something I treasure, and probably keeps much of the feeling at bay, along with a dose of daily meditation.

But this last week has really sucked.  I'm a person with very high situational awareness; I sit by fire exits for example.  I always have; being a perfectionist and a lover of the worst-case-scenario, I prepare for it.  But this manifests as bad paranoia when my anxiety hits.  It's not unusual for me not to sleep well; but this past week has been a string of four and five hour nights.  Naps and working out have kept me going, but it's been rough!

So today  I ran even further than I usually do and hopefully exhausted myself enough that I will sleep better.

All started when I was having odd pressure in my chest, thought it was heart problems. After a few more doctor visits, she told me it was anxiety. As it progressed things got weirder, weak feeling in my arm and shoulder blade, a feeling like someone is tickling the inside of my head, a feeling like my head is numb or someone is pulling my hair back when I touch my scalp, nausea that came for about a week at a time, and odd visual symptoms that made me blink a lot and made it hard to focus (that one is really hard to explain).

What made the ""anxiety"" diagnosis harder and harder to believe is that I was never anxious and am not an anxious person. Still, to this day, I don't think I have anxiety at all. I just feel sick. I am not nervous about going out, socializing, etc. I actually do everything I did before the anxiety, but just while feeling bad.

I, of course, do now worry about health problems. Brain tumor, MS, etc. Again while I know this is a symptom of anxiety, it's not really debilitating it's just me trying to figure out while I feel like crap.

When I'm anxious though, I'm a blithering idiot. I stumble over words, my sentences are muddled, I'm hyper-aware of how my voice sounds ugh. And, I'm always itching to just get out of the conversation

I know I'm a terrible artist but I drew this to put a face on the monster inside my head that is always lingering waiting to come out and make me miserable. 

I am 27 and I'm supposed to have it together by now. I'm pretty sure everyone I know thinks I'm a loser but doesn't ever say anything because I'm a very nice person and they do value my friendship but I know they don't respect me. Why should they? I'm 27, I have a bachelors degree from a really good school and i've just squandered it all away. I'm a waste. 

 I'm a disappointment to everyone who ever expected great things from me because I showed so much promise in college. Now I am nothing. My boyfriend loves me to let me stay home and go to school again but he doesn't understand that I wouldn't be able to make it in the workplace even with the medication I take. He told me he would be happier if I just tried to find something and if I didn't like it I could quit. In the same breath he told me he'd be disappointed that I babied out of it. That's just it, i'm a baby for not sucking it up and just dealing with it and getting over it. Like it should just be that easy. 

I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I think he thinks that I use the anxiety as a front to avoid adult responsibilities and a job because i'm just too lazy.

I want adult enough to be able to handle real adult things without having a melt-down. I want to be able to get out of bed reliability every morning and go to a job that would mean something to me. I just want to be normal. More than that I want the people around me to understand just how hard being ""normal"" is for me. I'm not asking to be coddled, but I wish the money you made wasn't the sole factor of how much you are worth for anybodies respect. 

I feel like life is unbearable and not worth it. I don't want to die, but I don't want to exist either. Life is such a burden to me. People say that life is a gift. I wish I could give this ""gift"" to someone else so maybe they could do a better job with it than I ever could. The worst part is that I confided all of this in my SO tonight and he told me he didn't think it was true and I wasn't like that. 

Thank you for listening. Also I don't want to hear anything about what a jerk my boyfriend is. He really cares for me and I think he WANTS me to be making this all up because its easier for him to cope with than a girlfriend that is just plain up nutty. I'm also sorry if this is in any way disjointed or makes no sense.

Each year there's always a new flair of a disease I worry about, I've been battling with health anxiety for so long now that i've gone through weird cancer fears, and now it's mostly just weird obscure stuff that always get me. 2 years ago it was Diabetes inspidus, wow that was fun! I was obsessed with drinking water, I  couldn't stop, I always felt thirsty, I was drinking like 5 litres a day. I was peeing in bottles so I could judge the colour of my pee because people with diabetes inspidous have no colour to their urine (disgusting I know, but at the time it felt like a necessity to do this, to prove to myself I was fine).    

Last year I was convinced I had Gastroparesis, a really fun ailment where your stomach stops moving, there's no cure, and you wither away until you get a stomach tube in you so you can get nutrients. I was convinced I had this because after every time I ate I would reflux it up, I'd burp 4 hours after eating something and it'd taste like what I ate before, and I looked at stomach emptying times and I saw two hours, so I was convinced my stomach wasn't working properly. I lost a ton of weight because I wasn't eating well, and eventually I got over this somehow just by eating more and not puking, because a lot of people gastroparesis vomit, and i wasn't vomiting. 

This year's it's been Reactive Hypoglycaemia. I'm always looking for answers as to why I feel the way I do. My anxiety feels physiological, like something is setting it off, I feel like it's not my thoughts, but my body, if that makes sense?  I noticed, or think I notice increased anxiety after eating a very sugary meal, I had one of the worst panic attacks ever after eating a bunch of cookies my roommate gave me. Doing research I came across Reactive Hypoglycaemia and I've been glued to my blood sugar monitor ever since. Spending so much money on the strips, anytime I'm low I freak out, if I'm too high i freak out, I try noticing trends but it's hard. I do get really low sometimes, and i get this hungry but nausea feeling, I'm obsessed. Last night I found an article though that helped ground me a bit, because it described exactly what I was going through with Reactive Hypoglycaemia. Here's the article...

Anyway this is just the tip of the iceberg for me when it comes to my health anxieties. Throughout all this I've been a major cardiophobe, I've been taking my blood pressure every day, multiple times a day since 2012. Now I take my blood sugar so many times a day that my fingers are sore typing this. I also check my temperature a ton, I'm pretty much a mess. 

Before you mention it I've tried the medication route with horrendous results, Zoloft made me have extreme Akathasia, so much so I was almost committed, one of the worst experiences of my life. Lexapro caused documented heart skipping, prozac made me suicidal. Benzos help but make me depressed and give me rebound anxiety. I have some beta blockers for when my heart gets too fast but honestly I'm afraid to take them. The SSRI's i've been on feel so similar to speed, my anxiety started when I was in highschool after doing too much ecstasy, and I'm just really med sensitive. 

I'm envious of you all that get on a drug and start getting your life back. Fuck I don't know whether to feel happy for you, or hate you. Because I wish I could have that, but it's not a option. I feel like some of you go on about how it's the *only* option, but meds are a big no for me, and others like me.

Among everything else I'm anxious about I also have a phobia of flying. I've been very scared of that for as long as I can remember.

I lived abroad for two years and during that time I had to force myself to fly quite a bit to visit family etc., and things got a little better. I got over my fear of airports after a while and even flying got a bit easier. Not easy but easier. I no longer panicked, even though I was still very anxious, and didn't really experience the physical symptoms of a panic attack.

However, a couple of years ago I had a bad flight and that completely ruined everything I had worked on (when it comes to the phobia) for the past three years or so. After that flight I was right back to square one. I think I might even be more scared now than before it got a little better. I've been avoiding all air travel since then.

Anyway, I unfortunately *have* to fly in the beginning of September and around Christmas and only thinking about it is enough to trigger a panic attack sometimes. I feel like I can't and won't set foot in an airplane unless someone drugs me so today I got some medication. The doctor prescribed 1 x 10 mg of oxazepam (maximum 2 per day). I've never taken anything stronger than beta blockers and hydroxyzine before (both for other kinds of anxiety). Certainly not benzodiazepines. I've got some questions that I hope someone might be able to answer:

- The doctor told me to try some medication at home to see what kind of side effects I can expect, so I'm thinking about trying one tomorrow. The thing is I'm not always super anxious when I'm at home so how will I know if it works or not?

- How do I know if 10 mg is enough for me not to panic when it's time to fly? I'm really worried I'll get to the airport and board the plane and realise that the medication isn't working. Then I will, seriously, think I'm going to die and thinking that you're going to die isn't pleasant so I'd like to avoid that.

Thank you."

Yesterday, I had accidentally left my meds at home.  It had been years without them, and I had a crazy meltdown, which involved taking a nap, where I apparently yelled at my boyfriend.  I hate showering at other people's houses, and this is frustrating him as well, because I don't want to go shopping or anything.  I also have a special needs dog who really can't be left alone without pissing all over their house. He had wanted to do something, but didn't because he couldn't get an answer of me.  I, of course, feel horrible.  
Today his mom asked if we wanted to go do something, like go for a walk or borrow their bikes. My boyfriend looked at me, and I shook my head ""no"".  His mom looked like she never would have expected that reaction in a million years.  I enjoy derping on the internet.  It's what I do.  As a child, I was an indoor kid; I would pray for rain so I didn't have to go outside for recess.  I like playing Sims and watching Law &amp; Order.  That's how I enjoy a weekend.  But she keeps saying like ""Oh, well you won't be depressed if you go out and do something"".  (My mom learned to stop asking long ago.) My boyfriend said very little.  He has still never told his parents about my anxiety and mood disorders.  So I'm hiding out in the spare bedroom with a book and my laptop.

I would go to my mom's but it's far away and I have to work in the morning.  All of our food will be spoiled.  At this point (5:00pm on a Sunday), we likely won't have time to buy food before tomorrow.  I have so much I want to do at home.   I feel like shit, because I know I'm disappointing everyone. I wouldn't be that bothered, if I could just relax and do what I like to do. 

TL;DR  At someone else's house, feeling trapped.  Just want to read and derp on internet.  Constantly being asked ""Why don't you go...?"" "

So yesterday after having a bit of a break down, I realized I might have to back on my meds. I've been feeling depressed for about a couple months although it wasn't a constant thing... when I left my house I was fine, but as soon as I'd come home, the soul crushing sadness would be there waiting for me. 

Last night I totally broke down because of a thousand different issues swarming me all at once. I never cry because I like to fight whatever I'm feeling, so losing control like that made me take a hard look at myself again.  I have anxiety/panic disorder and agoraphobia, which I have been medicated for and have overcome (which subsequently led to me stopping my medication. I've been off them for over a year now), but I think it's coming back.  

I'm starting school in September, and it's almost like I've subconsciously forced myself to not think about it.. but now that it's approaching so quickly, I'm feeling depressed, I feel sick to my stomach whenever I think about starting, my heart starts to beat quickly, I feel helpless and frustrated which is something I end up taking out on my family by being a bitch... I don't know what to do and I don't have much time to properly deal with the issues.... right now the only thing I can think of is going back on my meds and hope that I can manage it when school starts. 

It's like a vicious loop... thinking about school makes me anxious, and because I feel anxious i start to worry that my anxiety will be unmanageable and I'll fail school again which makes me even more anxious, rinse and repeat. 

What do you guys think? Should I go back to them? Should I try to tough it out? I can't fail again. I'm 22 with nothing to my name. I know I'm young but I'm so sick of feeling like a failure and working at a shitty part time job. 

I just hate everything right now :(

EDIT: I should also point out that I haven't even bought my books yet and cant bring myself to because I guess I'm in denial about going back. No idea how to deal with this. It's like a crazy immature kid took over my brain.

TLDR; going back to school is making me feel depressed and bringing back my anxiety, wondering if I should go back on meds. "

I was even given a month extension but that's already come and gone. Towards the end I was trying to space them out by taking one every other day. I can now feel the anxiety coming back as well as the early onset of withdraw symptoms. Is there anything I can do? I simply can't afford to be seen by my doctor right now since I'm on unemployment and it's about $300 just to walk in the door. If I just call the doctor's office and explain my situation is there a chance they'll write me a new Rx? Any help would be appreciated.
148,0.978839528781439,0.021160471218567737,0.171,0.753,0.076,"Hey all,

I know that a lot of you guys are feeling like crap right now. I know that many of you are worried about the future, and may think that you might even not have a future due to anxiety and panic disorders.

The reason I am writing this is to tell you that your anxiety and panic disorders *can* be cured, and it doesn't require medication, or endless doctor/ER visits. It only requires time and desire to rid yourself of this disorder.

Secondly (and sorry if this gets a bit long), I am writing this because this disorder has captivated my life for the past 8 years. I was always prone to anxiety and depersonalization, and it became full blown after I decided to take up weed/extacy. It came to the point where I became extremely agoraphobic, and my life came to a full stop.

There weren't many groups like this 8+ years ago, and for the longest time I thought I suffered alone, and had a serious mental condition (brain tumor, insanity, bipolar, [insert random weekly disease scare]) It was absolutely chaotic. My mind constantly raced at negative thoughts, and my heart was permanently beating at 100 bpm.
I hit rock bottom when I would get full blown panic attack for doing anything as simple as getting the mail from the front door.

I was exhausted both mentally, physically, emotionally, it was a disaster.

I atleast found out what the name of my condition was, and researched the crap out of it to try and find a means for an answer, try and find a ""cure"".

There was no magical cure. We all know that this isn't Strep Throat, you can't take 5 antibiotics and feel better.

At around this time, something was around the corner that I had completely forgotten about. My family trip to Costa Rica. 

Now, if you can, imagine yourself suffering from something so atrocious like Agoraphobia, you're 19, you're ""supposed"" to be in peak physical and mental condition, but you feel like a 70 year old with a botched up hip replacement (no offense to anyone) and slowly feel that you're caving in. Needless to say, I pleaded to stay and not go on this trip (keep in mind I kept all of this away from family and friends for over a year). After startling the crap out of my mom and seeing her in tears on the morning we had to catch our flight, I sucked it up and stepped out.

Let me just cut this a bit short, and simply say that the trip was no pleasant. In the time it took to get tot he airport, get on the plane, fly, get out of the airport, get to hotel, I must of had at least 50 full blown panic attacks.

This wasn't a leisurely ""relax by the pool for a week"" vacation either, this was a tour of CR (which, by the way if absolutely beautiful) We were constantly traveling, walking, moving, site-seeing, etc.

And it started to occur to me, very slowly but very surely, that the panic, anxiety, stress, that I've been having all of that time, didn't actually do anything to me. It felt extremely uncomfortable, it constantly put me in a state of absolute horror and fight or flight, but in between these attacks, and whenever I had my mind off of anxiety (as rare as it felt), I realized that It never actually brought me any harm.

By the end of my trip, when we had a few days left at the hotel, I felt so much better. My fear had gone down substantially, I was out and about doing regular stuff like a normal person.

Upon coming back home (the trip back was *a lot* smoother) and for the next few weeks afterwards, I was able to go out and about with minimal issues.

During that type, I would of nipped the whole problem at the bud, had I actually went through with ridding myself of this issue, but instead (I had a lot of down time during that time, just out or college, etc.) I decided to go back into the lifestyle of gaming and being lazy, and my disorder slowly, but surely, crept back.

I didn't want to deal with what had happened, and decided to take medication (zoloft, started at 25mg) and it seemed to take the edge off, but it never truly helped me. My doctor bumped it up to 50mg, but again, it only took the edge off and allowed me to do certain things, at certain times, without full blown panic attacks. I then began to restrict my life as a means to coping with the disorder, instead of dealing with it head on.

Only until about a year ago did I actually (and *finally*) deal with the issue head on. It was a tough ass battle, and the war is still quietly raging, but I am winning it, and I know because I haven't had a full blown panic attack in months.

I was able to do this because I realized one very important fact: **The anxiety and panic that you suffer is self-induced.**

I know this sounds obvious, but for all of you who are reading this and are sufferers - I want you to truly dwell on this idea for a minute; maybe 10 if you have to.

The simple fact of the matter is, regardless of where you are, or who you are with, what you are doing, the triggers of your anxiety and eventual panic are all perpetuated by you. *if you take your mind off of anxiety for even a minute, it will evaporate*. I'm sure you have all noticed this, but just don't know how to control it.

You don't control it. You laugh at it. You welcome it until it becomes weak, you realize this, your subconscious mind realizes this, and it becomes that much less significant.

I don't want anyone to think I'm writing this to make a pitch or anything, but I found out about the fundamental ideas of this through something called the Linden Method. I strongly suggest any sufferer to check it out.

As it stands now, I cannot say that my panic/anxiety have completely went away. I do try to make progress on it every day, but I can safely say that the few anxiety triggers that I still have are purely the act of the subconscious mind, and it will be dealt with.

I would be more than happy to answer any questions if anyone has any, and I truly hope that I have helped in me posting this. I have only recently seen this /r/ subreddit, and wish I would of found it sooner.

Thank you very much for reading this extremely long post!

My school offers counseling services and lists ""anxiety"" as one of the reasons we should see them. I'm going to try to set up an appointment to start seeing a counselor the earliest I can, which is Monday. Does anyone have any experience with college counseling like this for their anxiety? Will it be just a ""I talk to them the whole session every time"" thing or will they be actively working with me on solutions for lessening my anxiety? What about anxiety meds, is that something that can come about from starting here? (I'd be ok if it is)

Rant section: I'm so sick of living like this. These last 3 days have been complete anxiety hell for me (see last submission to this subreddit) and I just can't see it getting better anytime soon. Unfortunately I realized I wanted to see a school counselor on Friday night which is when the office closes, so I'm stuck until Monday (I would have reached out to them right away if I could have). The thought that I can take steps to make this better is really like the only positive thing in my mind right now. I've been and am currently still a total mess to the point where it's really impacting my health. I'll lose my appetite for a whole day at a time, then get really hungry and eat a bunch and then feel really sick. I even got a random nosebleed today which I can't help but think is connected since I haven't gotten one of those in like 10 years? But yeah, I just am really struggling and have no power over my situation which makes it so much worse and don't know how I'm going to even be able to sleep tonight. That's the worst part for me is that there just really aren't any steps I can do about any of the situations causing me anxiety right now, I'm totally powerless and just have to wait it out basically."

Every so often - sometimes 2 days a week or sometimes only one day every 2 weeks - out of nowhere I will feel constantly anxious. I'm currently experiencing it.  I wouldn't call it a panic attack because I don't feel frozen or like I'm panicking.  I feel like I can still think clearly enough... from the descriptions I've read of people's panic attacks I don't think I've ever experienced one.  

Basically when I get this way, my throat hurts, my stomach is painfully clenched, and I feel this uncomfortable buzzing in my head and body non-stop all day long.  When I get this way, no distractions make it stop, no amount of rational thinking makes it stop.  Like right now, I have nothing in the foreseeable future to be *that* anxious about.  Thinking about getting to do things I usually really enjoy doesn't help at all.  Even if I tell myself I'm going to play video games for a couple hours and then sleep in tomorrow, nope, still feel like I'm about to die.

I sometimes wonder if medication would relieve this at all, but my mom is *very* much against me going on medication.  And I would like to avoid it too but I'm open to it if it would really help.  

I'm wondering if anyone else has had these types of symptoms of anxiety and has found relief for it."

I've been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD) but I also have anxiety about other things. I went to my doctor a few weeks ago to discuss my meds and she mentioned looking into getting a workbook as anxiety is one of the more 'managable' mental ""problems"" (sorry, not sure how to phrase it) and that workbooks can help find triggers and overcome them etc. I've also been diagnosed with depression (although right now it isn't so much a problem) and an eating disorder and I see a therapist for the ED and we often talk about both my depression and anxiety.
(sorry for the ramble!) 
So, does anyone have any recommendations for anxiety workbooks (maybe even ED workbooks too if you happen to know of any)? I was browsing at barnes and noble yesterday but I didn't have enough cash to get one and afford dinner with friends. But I also don't really know what I'm looking for... So, any suggestions?

This week has been especially rough. I moved out of my apartment, am living with my sister temporarily (need to find campus housing on short notice, having no luck), and have had a rough week at work. 

I'm usually fine in the morning, but once or twice at work and then more at night, I suddenly feel like I can't breathe. It almost feels like an asthma attack, but it isn't because I don't have asthma last time I checked. And I also haven't died yet, so there's that. I've experienced that tight feeling in my chest due to anxiety before, but this feels worse. Or I'm more vulnerable so it seems worse? I don't know. But I'm on my sister's futon right now trying to convince myself I CAN breathe, I DON'T have asthma, and I'm NOT going to die.

To the main question, how many medications must I try before I find one that doesn't cause me side effects? I'm on either my fourth or fifth now, and it's getting a little discouraging as it feels like throwing rubber darts at a board and hoping one sticks.

It's very frustrating. It used to work for a while. Ive been on it about a year, and it stopped really working for anxiety about 6 mnths ago.

My life's been an absolute roller coaster for the past few years and my anxiety finally fucked me over really hard starting from last year. I never had any sort of health issues growing up until last year when I decided to move back to my hometown after spending a year in a uni far away from home.

 I had to somehow cope with my anxiety and weed was the only thing working for me. I had no idea that it was my anxiety killing me so I never went to a doctor to get checked out hence never got any medications. 

After feeling very sick for a few weeks when I realized that I had basically wasted a year of my life doing nothing and failed all of my courses, I decided to move back. Now that was really not the best thing to do. I was a wreck. Had lost a few pounds, emotionally I was fucked up because of all the problems with family and moving back and starting from beginning. Then both of my grandfather passed away, I accidentally ran my mom over with my car because she was laying on the fucking drive way, the program that I wanted to go into got cut and a lot of other stuff lead me to get worse and worse day by day. 

Then my parents had to go back to my home country for the memorials and such, so I had to take care of my younger brother and do the house chores and also manage to do my own school work and whatnot. 

Long story short, I'm now 20, it's been around 4 months that my anxiety has really taken over my life, my parents found out that I smoke weed and that did not make anything better since my parents are VERY anti drugs. My dad did not react well when he found my stash which happened twice. Both of the times he just started shouting and saying horrible things that no one ever wants to hear them for their dad such as things like "" I should have never brought you guys to this country, I have wasted my whole life because of you and now my own son is a drug addict. I have been dealing with people like you (junkies) my entire life and now I have to take care of my own son."" and just other horrible stuff. They are kind of acting normal now that it's been 3 months since he found out about weed but he still searches my car every time I come home and stares into my eyes for a few seconds every single time I see him so he makes sure I'm not high. 

I have thought about moving out but let's be honest, I'm a 20 year old guy who doesn't work, has no money, has nothing really so I can't move out, I don't want to ask my parents for money after all the things that has happened in my life for the past few weeks. I'm just stuck in this house and feeling miserable. 

They don't really know what's going on. They think the reason why I puke sometimes is because of the fucking drugs, or the reason why I can't eat anything in the morning is because of the drugs, or the reason why I'm smoking weed is because of them so I can just fucking relax for half an hour. 

Now I just don't know how to deal with this. I started taking venlafaxine on a low dose about 3 months ago, stopped taking it twice for a few weeks because I thought that there is nothing wrong with me and I'm just taking these because I was told by my doctor but 2 weeks ago after not taking venlafaxine for 3 weeks, My symptoms got worse but it's been a few days that I haven't woken up from stomachache at 3 in the morning but that has moved to 8 which is a nice change... 

I'm just tired. I'm devastated. I keep having this fake fucking smile on my face whenever I'm with my family but deep down I'm a wreck. There is just so many things going on with my life that I don't know how to deal with them all AT THE SAME FUCKING TIME. I just don't know what to do and how to go on with my life. 

I hope I can get some feedback from you folks but this felt really good writing out my life story sort of. 

I also hope that y'all have a great day, week and just a great life ahead of you. This anxiety thing is horrible.

edit: Oh by the way, I don't have any drug dependencies or anything as such.. I'm just a regular stoner"

I am taking generals at a community college and have possibly fucked up my opportunity to be able to get a carrier in the field I want or be able to pay for it and I am so panicked and freaked and don't know what to do. 

Now for the story:
I guess I'm not really sure where to start. I don't have many people to talk to about this so I've resorted to strangers on the Internet haha. But this seems like a supportive community I could possibly get some reassurance from. I guess I'll start sort of from where I started getting all this anxiety and nervousness from.
 I'm an (almost) 21 year old female. in highschool I got fairly good grades, graduated with a GPA of like 3.8 out of a 4.0 GPA. I applied to the big university for my state and was accepted into the honors program but saddle I couldn't afford it and I couldn't get big enough loans and I just couldn't seem to get any scholarships. So I was crushed but decided to go to the tech and just do my generals while staying with my parents. From there I've just gotten so anxious all the time. I've developed rashes on my arms from it that come and go and I've also developed a little bit of an anger problem. I've gained weight, and have just been so worried all the time. Tried therapy but I'm so shy it didn't help a ton. Tried some meds but the doc gave me this really weak shit that didn't help much. I relax with artwork and photography and pets. I have a 5 gallon fish tank, a rabbit, a preying mantis, a betta and a cat. I love just watching them, it's really relaxing, but it still doesn't help when I'm working or at school.
Anyways I'll be done with my generals this semester and I'm freaking out so badly. I've applied for some more scholarships and another college in town that can help save some more money but give me a few more prephysical therapy classes. Problem is all I can think about is what if I don't get into this college? My grades have been iffy over the last couple years. Working, helping with my brother, classes full time and my sorta second job from my artwork has out a huge toll on me and in now average about a 3.4 GPA. I even have a Withdrawal on my record because I got bronchitis at one point. What if I don't get into this college? What if I don't get this scholarship? I don't have any option but to work full time at my retail job that I hate so much and I worry I won't get the chance to get the carrier I wanted. I feel like I'm stuck in the middle with everything. My grades aren't amazing so I won't be able to get into a physical therapy school and my art isn't amazing so I couldn't change to art school. I have no idea what to do. I'm trying to get into volunteering but I don't exactly have a ton of time and I'm worried if I add to my list of stuff to do ill just have a full blown panic attack and break down.
By boyfriend doesn't understand as he's never actually gone to college. My parents both went to college but they're majors weren't near as hard and they didn't have to pay near as much as they didn't go to the big huge universities with the programs That cost a fuck ton and are competitive like mine. I feel like a fucking winer when I complain about this to my couple of friends cause they're all just working instead of going to college but they did try and it just wasn't for them I guess. I just feel like I'm stuck. I feel like a winy loser about this. I know I'm lucky to be able to even go to the college I did, and have a family to stay with and a part time job when a lot of people don't even have half of those things.

Around this time last year, I started developing consistent headaches around my sinus area, gradually increasing tinnitus, and general restless, which I probably brought onto myself from worrying.  A month or two in, the doc ordered an MRI of the brain and sinuses which came back showing a golf ball sized arachnoid cyst (not_a_tumor.jpg), but it appeared to have been there since the beginning of (my) time.  The neurosurgeon was unconcerned; said there was no pressure and it wasn't the cause of the headaches.  ENT said sinuses were clear and everything looked great.   Between the time of having the MRI ordered, having several days in limbo between knowing there was some things to be looked at with brain doctors, and eventually getting the all clear, I seemed to have psyched myself into an issue which I can only describe as anxiety.  I'm not sure if this is correct.  It's not generally an attack of sorts where I'm afraid I'll die, or my heart will explode, but rather a string of 4-6 days of feeling general tweaky hell.

   Fast forward to today.  My life is generally low-stress.  I work a 9-5 in a great company.  Expectations are not unusually high, and I have a great family.  However, I continue to feel as if I've downed a case of red-bulls on a daily basis.  I've sloppily self-diagnosed myself with some sort of anxiety disorder, and the doctors that I've seen tend to go along with this.  My symptoms which have been going on for the last year, in varying levels of intensity are twitchy eyelids, lots of goop in my eyes, stiff neck, strong tinnitus, mild nausea, and most of all, a general but strong feeling of uneasiness/racing thoughts/and irritability.  Like I've seriously half drowned myself in rockstar/redbull/coffee/whatever. 

So far, my medications and effects have been:

Citalopram - Intensified the yucky mental feeling (anxiety?) many times over, to the point where I didn't want to do anything, although doing nothing was probably the worst way to deal with it.

Venlafaxine - Similar to the effects of citalopram, but with lesser intensity. 

Wellbutrin - Seemed to level things out, but would still make me feel worse for a few hours after taking the medication. 

Xanax - Mostly works.  I'm taking this in small doses (.5mg) once every few days.  Since it is habit forming and makes me drowsy, I'd rather not take it, but it does help to knock the edge off.

The first 3 medications I gave up after 1-6 weeks, depending on how shitty they made me feel.  I understand that most antidepressants take longer to work, but the side effects were just too much.  


I'd like to know if anyone has a related experience and what may have helped along the way.  Obviously I could (and probably will) switch doctors several times until something clicks, but getting appointments takes an amazingly long time.  I feel bad for those who are worse off than me, and have to wait months for an opening.

tl;dr:  I feel like shit 75% of the time and don't know why."

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety six years ago and been on medication since that time. I'm not in therapy now, but I have briefly seen psychologists several times over the years.

When I was fourteen, I found my mother passed out on the couch in her bodily fluids and she was air-lifted to hospital. Turns out she had a huge brain tumour (a meningioma). It wasn't cancerous and it was removed, but she was in hospital for four months after getting an infection after the surgery. 

I'm 20 now, and still live at home. A little over six months ago, I woke up to the sound of plates crashing. When I got up, my mother was having a seizure on the kitchen floor. I called an ambulance and she went to hospital. We don't know what caused it, but she was put on medication and discharged and hasn't had a seizure since.

Ever since then, my anxiety has been really bad. If I hear any odd noise during the night, I wake up (I sleep pretty lightly since that night) and have to go check on her. I usually wake her up once a night to make sure she's okay. I always have to call to check in if I go out and if she doesn't answer her phone I get really worried. 

I almost feel like I have a very mild case of PTSD. Ever since that night, I'm just a nervous wreck. I'm so worried she'll have another seizure, and I know seizures aren't generally dangerous on their own but something bad could happen and I might not be here to help. "

I'm struggling lately with anxiety, and started seeing a therapist and also started taking an antidepressant, which makes me feel less creative, less emotionally connected and less interested in others. My kindness and patience are much much less. More like a robot in a way. But it also alleviates much of the overanalysis and makes me less sensitive to stimuli that I might perceive as negative. My social anxiety and obsessive thoughts have improved, but I miss the old ""sensitive"" self who cares about others and wants to make the world a better place.

I guess I should talk to the therapist about this. I just wonder if I'm better off seeing her more often and working through the cognitive distortions and unhealthy patterns on my own, which seems better, or taking the medication as well, even though it's not really ""me.""

Thus - About 20 minutes ago, I figured that this was the perfect time to walk down the 10 steps or so and take out the garbage, because hey, no people around. Safezone, right?

At this point, I've already taken my sleeping meds, and I'm still a bit dazed from an anxiety attack earlier, so while I'm stumbling groggily down the very steep steps whilst admiring the moon, I think I'm at the bottom of the steps, and stick my leg out, but I'm not at the bottom - In fact, I'm a good 3 steps away.

Yet, I go to put my foot down and the cold embrace of gravity sends me crashing to the ground with an almighty thud... the bin bags went flying off into the bloody clouds, funny stuff to be honest. I even looked up at  the moon like it was the moon's fault and I was about to claim compensation from it.

Instictively, I break the fall with my left arm/hand, and land super hard on my right knee, complete with gashes on all 4 fingers, a twisted wrist, early bruises, and an impairment in my left arm's movement, because I have a trapped nerve in both sides already which restricts the motion in them.

But here's the funny thing -
As my breath suddenly loses me and the ""Holy crap, I just flew down a steep set of steps"" thoughts enter my head, I immediately get back up, peel my aching body off the gravel, and tell myself, without any hesitation whatsoever -

""Tomorrow, man. We'll nail it tomorrow. Let the adrenaline do it's thing. Your breathing will normailze, Luke. DO NOT PANIC. You'll be fine... but damn it man, go clean the blood off, and bandage yourself already, I can already feel the soggy crap on your favourite shirt.... And feel a bit manly, you've earned it, mate."" (I talk to myself a lot)

See, this is all 'very' weird to me because:
I always worry to an 'obsessive degree' that my body is going to give out, that something's wrong with it, and something very bad is on the way, like some serious condition, or disease, or impairment, being a hypocondriac and all, and that's on top of everything else - But that fall has taught me something, something I'd like to pass on to you folks -

'We are not made of glass. We can take a freakin' hit or two.'
Our bodies can be as tough as our minds at times.

However, I respect that some of us are disabled, and such a thing seems quite implausible: Like coming out of something like that with a positive attitude and some gashes here and there, but there's one other thing too -

I'm disabled. I have been for years now. And it hurt like hell. But I dealt with it, because I'm 22 and I live alone. I had to.
2 trapped nerves. Bad back. Bad knees (doubly so now, lol), wobbly legs, lightheadedness, chest pains, you name it, my doctor's told me I have it - But I'll live, and as long as I can still type, I'll be fine, being a budding writer and all. 

Sure, it's sore and aching like a bitch, and my trapped nerve has been aggrovated big time, along with the pain still pulsating through my entire left side, resigning me to this chair here - But the movement's slowly returning, and my sense of humour remains intact, and dry.

I'll sleep on it if I can, and see how it is when I wake up.
I just didn't know I could still take a big fall like that.... might be down to the excessive milk consumption.

Point is - that was one hell of a fall, but I got the hell back up, and realised what my body was still capable of, so who's to say that you, reading this right now, can't take a few hits of your own, and that your body isn't determined to keep you going when you fall, in mind or body? Or both?

We're tougher than we perceive ourselves to be. Much tougher, and that much translates to our mind when we prove it to ourselves, but by all means, please don't go running headfirst into a fridge or something just to prove it. That hurts, trust me.

If this post helps just one person gain just that tiny little bit of confidence, then I'll be a happy chappy.


TL;DR - You're stronger than you think.... and drink lots of milk, I guess.

Peace and love, guys. Keep fighting.
And remember, fall down your steps responsibly."

She's had 3 long term relationships, even though she's sees the end of their relationships as the mans fault. Everyone one else sees her as controlling and irrational and doesn't blame the guys for leaving her. 

Now she's dating my brother in law. It's the first time I'm getting both sides of the story. I used to relate to her in the fact that I would over react to a disagreement and but either mid fight or soon after I would say ""whoa sorry I went crazy I shouldn't have said or done that. I'm sorry."" I feel like that's just an immature girl thing, that most of us grow out of. 

Recently my BIL was with her Thursday night through Sunday morning and after needed space said she was being bitchy, picking fights, and he wanted space so she got mad and he said he might come over Monday. The next day (Monday) my husband and I invited him out for happy hour. He asked her would you be mad I I went with them? Se responded it doesn't seem like you are either way
So he's like here we go again and that's when he asked my advice with her. I suggested he just invite her out with us so he did she answered and hung up saying leave her alone and what not. 
So we went out and dropped the subject. That's when she starts texting me. Do I invite her out. She says no, that her and my BIL are fighting and I said why she said she's been being a bitch and he doesn't want to be around her. I said why would he if you just said your being a bitch? 

This time I took a different stance than I ever have before. Instead of coddling her I was honest with her. If you're anxiety is this big of a problem I am not qualified to help you, you need to see a therapist and learn tools to deal with it. She's on meds for it but didn't get counseling. I wasn't being blunt until she said she's NEVER felt like this or done this before! I was like this is probably the 50th time?!? 

Well now she's mad at me? Big surprise. In my mind I feel like she is throwing a tantrum over and over again. I e never seen her have a panic attack. She never acts this way per anything other than a boyfriend! 
She does great socially. 
Does this sound like anxiety? Or emotional girl shit she hasn't grown out of?

I also lost my dad to cancer while I was away at school during my first year of grad school.

I have for especially the last year had almost constant symptoms to some degree involving a flighty/unfocused feeling, tingling under my scalp and the top of my head, and sometimes numbness and tinging elsewhere like limbs and my tongue.  Recently, I have also had incidents when I am in class when I feel so pressured and ""intense"" that I feel like something akin to passing out is going to happen unless I get up and walk out of class into the fresh air, etc.

I have seen both MDs and psychiatrists, and the tests always come back normal, everything from blood work to MRIs show nothing drastically wrong with me.  Most doctors' best guess is anxiety (GAD)/depression, and I have been prescribed Prozac, welbutrin, and most recently one I have not yet filled, Lexapro.

Prozac and welbutrin didn't seem to do much at the dosages I was on, and made me sweat like mad, so I tapered them off.  I'm just unsuer as to whether I want to try the most recent prescription, and here's why:  In some weird way, I feel like I still hope that my physical symptoms are due to something/anything other than GAD, maybe sleep apnea, thyroid, who knows.  I just am a bit leery for better or worse about trying to make a medicated ""state of mind,"" my new normal

This is not helped by the casual searches for this and other drugs that I do on here and elsewhere, that seem to show some pretty serious potential side effects, and dependency/other issues in long term usage.

I just don't know where to turn at this point, I feel like I am at an impasse.  If this is all or mostly anxiety-caused as people are telling me, I both do and don't want to turn to the meds as the solution for the reasons above.  On the other hand, I feel like I can't live like this.  I feel like I'm a shell of what I was 10 years ago, a waste of energy who is just getting slowly older and dragging towards the grave in the worst way.

I can't get rid of that feeling of a knot in the stomach, and my heart is pounding.

I'm also going to go to class today after the gym. Last semester I skipped weeks of class because I felt terrible in the mornings and could not make myself go outside. Instead I listened to lecture recordings on my own but ended up doing poorly. But I'll take it easy today. I only have one hour of class in the afternoon, and two in the evening. Between that time I'll take a break.

Lastly, I am going to promise myself that I will be patient. I have been on two different types of medication since September, and I don't think the dosage is right for me yet but I won't stop trying. And if medication is not the right answer for me, that's okay, I'll try something else if it comes to that.

I've slowly developed this unusual fear of my heart. I'm worried because it's autonomous that it will just stop working one day and that scares me very much.

I first recognized it when it started happening at age 17. It caused me to lose sleep and over analyze every moment. It then progressed into my breathing. Then my brain. And just this month, my left ear has developed a pressure issue.

I used to be able to fly in a plane, drive at night, ride a boat, go hiking, but now I can't do any of that without having a serious mental attack (that manifests itself as pressure in the place I'm freaking out about). I've also developed a fear of space (like beyond Earth) and of really open spaces (like a field) because I'm afraid I will float into space and die. 

I'm now 20 and I've been seeing a councilor once a week for about two months. I'm very overweight (320 lbs) and don't work out currently. I don't take any medicine whatsoever.

My inquiry is, what do you all think I might have? I feel like a backwards hypochondriac. My whole situation is very stupid because I don't have any tangible sickness, it's just all in my head.

Thanks everybody. Hope you're having a good holiday season!"

I was only told that it was caused by a build-up of stress. One day I realized that I felt strange, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Over the next 2-3 days I developed a migraine that wouldn't go away, a fogginess in my thoughts, tremors, and a stutter so bad that I couldn't effectively communicate verbally anymore.

Yesterday I woke up with a migraine that still hasn't completely gone away. I took something new that my doctor had prescribed (I get migraines 2-4 times a week). I felt foggy for the rest of the day and noticed slight tremors in my hands, but I didn't think much of it and dismissed it as side-effects. Today I've noticed that the tremors still haven't gone away. I feel like there are little vibrations through my entire body. The fogginess comes and goes. It makes it hard to focus on a single thought. I haven't experienced any stuttering, but I'm terrified that it's coming. Last time it took a little more than a month of constantly slowing myself down, reading out loud, and singing to work my way out of stuttering. It was absolute hell. It tanked my self-esteem when I had to speak to strangers (ordering at restaurants, etc.), and I felt like I was going crazy half the time.

I'm not sure if I'm still just experiencing side-effects or what is happening. It's not characteristic of my panic attacks. I trust my doctor, but I can't help wondering if my different medications are reacting poorly with one another. I take Bupropion for anxiety, something for blood pressure that I can't recall the name of, Tramadol for the headaches, and Gianvi (birth control).

Fast-foward to today and I rarely even consider anxiety as a variable in my daily life. It would seem that out of mind equals out of body.

The drugs however are still here and, as many of you know, really tough to kick. I'm currently taking 150mg of Effexor XR and Wellbutrin XR daily. I've also managed to culture a fairly aggressive daily marijuana habit. I've been on the effector for over a decade now and the Wellbutrin and Weed go back about 3 years.

Since the major reason for taking the legit meds is gone I'd like to get rid of them; the side-effects are still there and reduce my quality of life.

Does anyone have suggestions as to which drug they'd give up first? I believe both weed and effexor work on serotonin while the wellbutrin plays more with norepinephrine. As such is there an advantage to giving up one before the others?

I'd rather not stop smoking weed but if continuing seriously handicaps my efforts then I suppose I'd have to consider it.

Much to my surprise it has been working, ever so slowly.  Lexapro has made my life so much easier...and normal...which is exactly what I was seeking by turning to a professional.

However, the reduced anxiety has introduced a new problem - I feel much more at liberty to express myself.  Doesn't sound like a problem, right?  Here's where it gets tricky:

A former employer terminated my contract without notifying me.  This happened in July.  They didn't even bother saying ""goodbye"" but more importantly they gave me no opportunity to retrieve my belongings.  Now they refuse to return them, not explicitly, but by ignoring requests made by myself and my recruiting agency.

The anger and anxiety over this just keeps building and building.  Mind you, I never received any kind of performance feedback from these people and performance was not the reason they cited to the recruiting agency for my termination.  They said, essentially, financing for my position magically disappeared.  One would wonder why they would even advertise this position and hire someone for it if they didn't have the resources to fund it.  But that's apparently how they operate.

I want the items back.  One of them doesn't belong to me and I can't return it to its original owner.  It's not the value of the item, I could easily compensate the owner for that.  It's the data contained on the item (it's a USB flash drive).

My psychiatric sessions focus solely on the efficacy of the medication.  It is not ""talk"" therapy so I cannot ask the psychiatrist for advice on how I should handle this.  

The people at this company lied to my face.  They smiled, acted as if everything was fine, and plunged a knife in my back.  It's the scummiest thing that I've ever witnessed.  What makes it even harder is I've never had an employment experience like this.  ALL of my former employers before this provided glowing references, and one of them even pleaded with me not to leave - but I had to go for professional reasons.  My current employer just recently brought me into the office to tell me how much they appreciate the work I'm doing and the contributions I've made.

It's just this one horrible experience with the company I now refer to as Mos Eisley.  I was raised to believe that one MUST take accountability for wrongdoing, that you don't get a free pass to trample on others.  But I'm powerless here.  It just lingers, like a bad odor.  I can't get an answer from these people, no explanations, not even a ""fuck off and stop emailing us"".  

How do I let go?  How do I explain to my friend that I can't get his USB drive back?  How do these people rationalize treating someone this way?  These questions haunt me, constantly."

I've been on a number or medications such as citalopram, fluoxetine and pregabalin but nothing has worked. Due to how worse it has been, plus the fact I've got a situation coming up which I think is going to trigger the same effect in me, I went back to my GP who prescribed 14 2mg diazepam tablets to help me.

I'm really hoping these have a positive effect on me and I'm feeling confident, however I'm concerned that doctors are very reluctant to prescribe benzos long term because of addiction, so I'm worried that I'll find something that helps me in these situations and I won't be able to get them again.

About a year after graduation, I felt like I needed to go on it again, so I went to my new doctor in my new city and she wrote me a Rx for 50mg. Six weeks later, I went back to her and said I was having very strange symptoms/side effects this time: racing thoughts, terrible insomnia, hyperactivity, etc., all things that I'd read online might be associated with bipolar. She completely dismissed me, said those weren't real side effects of Zoloft, and then upped my dose to 100mg. Then last Friday--one week after she increased my dose--I had such a severe panic attack that I had to leave work and go to the emergency room, which has never happened to me before.

Now I'm in a really tough spot because I don't trust that doctor anymore, but I can't seem to find anyone else who can help me. I've called a dozen psychiatrists, and none will return my calls. I have an appointment with a psychologist next week, but I know she can't help me with medication management. I tried switching to a different GP at the clinic I go to, but they can't get me in for two weeks. I feel like I need to see a doctor *now,* as in within the next few hours, or a day at the most. When I was in the ER on Friday, they gave me a small amount of Ativan, and I've already blown through almost a third of it because my symptoms seem to be getting worse and I feel like I'm constantly on the brink of another panic attack.

Does anyone have any advice, or is anyone able to even commiserate? I feel like no one understands how much pain I'm in and that, no, I really can't continue on like this for another two weeks. I could really use some support :-/

With this new look and lifestyle I began to realize how good I was feeling without taking my daily anti-anxiety medication. But I've had some personal troubles recently that required me to take 2-3 pills a day. So now that time has passed I'm wondering if I should/could stop taking any medication all together. The pharmacy called me today to notify me of a refill that is waiting for me, but I'm apprehensive about going and picking it up. Should I take them even though I'm doing OK without them. I sort of feel like I'm doubting myself. Like I don't have the confidence in myself to deal with problems as they come. I don't know what it feels like to have the ability to trust in myself and not rely on a pill to help me cope with life. I'm nervous that I'm not nervous enough. That sounds crazy I know....."

About three years ago, I experienced (what I perceived to be) a life threatening situation, which caused me to have my first panic attack.  I have them maybe 5 times a year, and usually it's when I'm feeling very sick/exhausted/stressed, or when I'm stressed about a situation.  

When I begin to get anxious, I want to slow my breathing but it seems that when I try to concentrate on slowing and controlling my breathing, it sends me into full blown panic attack mode.  My attacks consist of rocking, severe hyperventilating, and my hands clench up, and my fingers go completely numb.  So far, the only thing that has helped is if someone rubs my back.  

What are other coping mechanisms you've found that work?  Controlling breathing doesn't help me, and I don't want to always rely on someone to be there to rub my back to bring me out of it.  I need to learn to start controlling them because my attacks are situational, and meds aren't really necessary at this point.

Thank you!"

I've had it since I was a child and just when I felt I was getting a hold on it -- learning how to deal with it -- it's come back in the form of night panic attacks.

They're really terrible and leave me exhausted for days later. In addition to the tiredness, being so uptight does a number on my stomach. 

Part of me wants to try medicine just to see if it'll help, but I'd rather try out some natural remedies.

My parents were drinking a lot when I was young. There was a lot of yelling and hitting. I felt unsafe at school and at home. On the weekends when they were not drinking I felt ok. Not happy, I can’t remember a time when I was actually happy. There was always some kind of a problem, either medical or financial. They had enough money to provide essentials to me and my brothers. They just preferred to spend it on alcohol.

I have a couple of medical problems. Not sure if they were caused by my anxiety and depression or if it was the other way around. I have severe psoriasis on my scalp and in other areas on my body. My gums bleed despite flossing, brushing, rinsing and regular visits to the dentist. As of a week I have lost partial hearing in my left ear. I am pretty sure it is connected to my psoriasis but I have yet to consult a specialist.

I used to enjoy things. I have been very passionate about video games, books, music, TV shows and movies. I thoroughly enjoyed any kind of fiction. I used to come up with the ideas for books, TV shows and movies. Now I enjoy nothing. I have sold almost all of my possessions to have some sort of emergency fund. I have no debts, but since my health is not too well I consider it necessary. I also did it because I did not enjoy them anymore. I have sold all my gadgets. The only things of any value I own are a laptop and a phone.

I have not left the house in almost two years since I have graduated college. Except for the occasional trip to another city to visit my brother. I do not go out since I have no friends. I used to have one female friend. We used to hold hands together and generally talk about everything. But we had some differences and now we do not even talk anymore. I feel kind of indifferent towards females. My sex drive is at all times low. I rarely masturbate. Not because I feel the need to. Simply because I have read somewhere that regular ejaculation prevents prostate cancer. I work out a lot. But there are no gains in muscle mass or confidence. I do it because I feel like I need to, but deep down I feel like it is pointless. Like everything else.

I have not been able to get a full time job for the same amount of time. I had literally two job interviews since I left school. On both occasions I have heard the same thing: That I give of the vibe of someone extremely introverted and shy and that I might not be a good fit for their team. I have been deluding myself that I have some minor translation work going for me but I have not done anything with it for a long time. I might be able to start soon if I get accepted into another company but I will not be making much. I get intense panic attacks in situations which will affect my future. These include job interviews and meetings with new people and old colleagues. I do not think I am a hypochondriac. It prevents me from having the life I want. I cannot afford therapy or medication. Not until I get that good job. It is so bad that I am considering drinking before my next big interview.

I do not know what to do next. They tell me to live but I do not see the point to. Every situation, friendship, relationship feels temporary. Nothing lasts forever. I am terrified of growing old. I am scared of what other medical problems another ten years will bring. I fear being alone for the rest of my life. I am scared of being dependent on others for the rest of my life. But that is exactly what we all are, dependent on our employers and clients. I need advice. Please tell me what else I can do.

Recurrent issues include: my feeilng neglected/him feeling that I am too demanding, my overwhelming jealousy of his exes (whom he contacts on a regular basis), and both of us being unable to let go of past wrongs.

So, like I said, a mess. A month ago, the issue of him watching porn was brought up. We went about that topic pretty aggressively (no hitting or anything, just raised voices), and it ended with him telling me I needed to move out. I had a panic, called a few peope for support, and (after some protesting) have been looking for places since.

He started going to individual counselling a month ago, and we have our first couple's session this week. I started going to a different counselor a month ago. I'm on medication for anxiety. 

Meanwhile, he has adopted the ""I do what I want"" attitude. I'll bring up something that he's done that hurt me, and he will say that he can't make me feel better and that I just have to deal with those feelings on my own. That he's allowed to do what he wants. It's frusrating. Anything I'm upset about, he dismisses as ""a thing you need to deal with on your own"". Additionally, he said he will not acknowledge any text or message if it is not friendly or at least neutral. 

I'm feeling overwhelmed and lost. Bf says he still wants to stay together; he thinks that living separately is a step forward and will help our relationship. I feel unwanted and unsupported. But, like I said, we're going to a couple's counselling session this week. There's a bunch of shit here. What do you think I should start with in the first session?

I'm very useless. I'm 17. I'm a guy. I live in Germany. Never had anything with girls. I can't talk to anybody about all this, because that makes me feel really awkward. I'm ignored because of my shyness. **But I need attention.**


I want somebody to *care* about me. I want someone to listen to my problems. I want someone to help me finding friends. I need someone to help me from the deepest of his heart. Not for money. Not forcibly.


You would probably tell me something about ""*It'll be fine*"" or ""*You have all your life before you*"" or even ""*There is medication for this*"". I don't want to hear this anymore. I only want to find somebody who cares about my feelings, about my present. Ignoring my past, without preaching about my future. **I want to live.**

I'm sick of how sexuality is dominant in today's community. I'm sick of how a nice person cannot be as successful as an asshole. I'm sick of all the racism, sexism, etc. leaving marks in the society. I'm sick of the world. I hate this world. But I love the people. I love my parents. I love my brother. I love all my living relatives. I love all my friends and their girlfriends. Even when some of them are assholes sometimes, I love them all as person. **I only want to be loved back**.

I'm just a loser, trying to be nice to everyone. It makes me cry, when I'm being told how they all care, how I'm not useless, how they all need me. I know, that it's not true. I know you'll ignore me, when I'm with you. I know, you wont give me an example of how I'm useful. I know you won't ask *me* for help, when you need it. If you can't give me love, **then at least give me honesty**.

I don't want to claim that I want to be treated as I deserve, since I don't know what I deserve. I want my needs to be satisfied, just like any other person. I don't want people to tell me that it's all gonna be all right. I want people to help me **make** it all right. I can't stand being rejected by everybody anymore. I don't want styling tips. I don't want medication. I want a lovely kick into my ass from somebody who cares, Because I can't do it by myself.

I can't draw attention. I can't talk to strangers. I can't go anywhere alone. I need somebody. Find me somebody to love. I can't do this by myself. My confidence is basically zero. I don't care about myself anymore. That makes it all worse. I know, ""there is somewhere the person I'm looking for"". But knowing this doesn't really help much, don't you agree? I suck at searching stuff. Especially when I don't know where. Or how. I'm often told that *I need a girlfriend*. But it's not as easy as it looks to find someone.

Also, I'm often told that I'm nice, sweet, kind, gentle, etc. But that hasn't helped me. Telling me nice stuff only makes me sad. Instead of boosting my confidence, it crushes me. **When I'm so great, why am I treated so badly?** I know, I'm also annoying, I'm very lazy, I'm pretty much stubborn in these matters. **Just like anybody else, I'm not perfect**. I'm nothing special.

Kindness apparently is a thing which can't help you very much in life. It makes me boring. Nobody cares about me, I'm plain boring. Being nice to everyone made anything about me boring. You'd rather listen to a story about some asshole burning down a house than to a story how some nice guy helped to rebuild it. That's why society is shitty.

I'd write a lot more of my thoughts, if I remembered them all.

I'm sorry if I just took a lot of your time. I'm sorry for taking your time. I'm sorry for whoring for attention. **But that's what I need**."

Long story short: Have suffered from 4 full blown panic attacks over the past 6 weeks, 3 in the last seven days. Since last Saturday's panic attack I've had fairly severe anxiety and restlessness (not tremors, per se, but I can't stop moving for long) throughout the day coupled with a strong headache that is only marginally improved with Aleve or Advil. The morning of Saturday I felt perfectly fine before the cup of coffee that triggered the damn thing. Ever since then, it almost feels like I'm going through some kind of withdrawal. Am I missing something?
Age: 26 Male
Previous History/Substances taken: 

* Alcohol binge+withdrawal: Summer 2012, July 2014, totally abstinent since.

* Melatonin 10mg - 5x a week for about 2-3 months until Wednesday the 18th.

* Aleve daily from 18th - 24th.

* L-theanine 400-600 mg daily from 18th - 24th.

* Smoked marijuana - 14th, 18th

Context

* First panic attack about 4-6 weeks ago, at work. Worked moving material around a manufacturing shop, which kept me on my feet for most of the night. Attributed it to energy drinks as I was working graveyard at the time. Went back in the next day, and anxiety dissipated within a couple of days.

* 14th (Saturday): Smoked marijuana (live in Washington). It was the end of Valentine's day, and my fiancée had wine but I am abstinent from alcohol having withdrawn from it twice before, once in 2012 and most recently in July. Hadn't touched marijuana in at least three years, but felt no immediate ill effects from it.

* 18th (Wednesday): Quit my graveyard job as I was never well rested and just couldn't deal with the schedule. Smoked again that afternoon just as a ""fuck it all"" thing. Had been taking 10 mg melatonin on weekdays for about 3 months. Coupled it with Nyquil pills (not liquid to avoid the alcohol) for about 3 weeks before quitting.

* 18th-21st: Tried to readjust my sleep schedule back to normal hours. Stopped taking all melatonin and Nyquil at this time. Felt general tiredness and fogginess, bit of a headache, and malaise but no anxiety. 

* 21st: Slept from 9pm to about 5am, felt great. Had a cup of coffee (hadn't had regular coffee in a while, but I'd consumed caffeine in the form of sodas for a while before this), which within an hour triggered a terrible anxiety attack. Called the paramedics, but of course started feeling better after I knew they were coming so I called them off. Did jumping jacks and other physical activity to ""burn off"" the anxiety. Went to Vitamin Shoppe to pick up some L-Theanine chewables. Took 200mg that day. No real anxiety to speak of the rest of that day. 

* 22nd Sunday: Noticeably higher anxiety levels upon waking. Extremely anxious to the point of pacing around the living room. Took 500-600mg L-Theanine throughout the day, but didn't seem to do much. Not quite anxious to the point of panic attack but restless to the point where I couldn't sit still for more than a minute or two. Managed to do a grocery run together without problem. Fiancee and I made arrangements to drive up to Vancouver for a couple of days. Thought it would be good for me to get away for a bit. Ran 2 miles. 

* 23rd Monday: Fairly high anxiety levels driving up, I couldn't manage to drive more than 40-45 minutes. Bad anxiety set in after checking in to the hotel. Dealt with it for about 1.5 hours before we went out on a walk. The walk helped, kept busy until the end of the day without major issues. 

* 24 Tuesday: Woke up again with bad anxiety. Went around town for a while until about 2pm, when I felt my headache increase and fatigue. Went back to the hotel to rest, but I couldn't rest. Got anxiety to the point where I asked my fiancee if we could go home, a day early. Anxiety dissipated after an hour on the road, but flared up again to a panic attack for the final 45 minutes before getting home. Decided it might be best to totally abstain from all medicine and supplements to see if I just need a reboot of some kind.

* 25 Wednesday: Woke up feeling marginally better than previous mornings. Still high anxiety and restlessness. Went on a quick two mile run before fiancee woke up. Felt okayish throughout the morning. Broke down crying for an hour after fiancee left for work. Went on another run, this one three miles which somewhat helped. Tried my best to keep my mind occupied to little avail, but still managed to stave off a full blown panic attack.

* 26 Thursday: Again felt marginally better waking up in the morning. Didn't quite feel the same need to pace around like a madman. Went on a long, 5 mile walk with my fiancee which felt good in the moment, but that feeling didn't last long after returning home. Still, felt better than the previous afternoon. Managed to get out and go to Walmart and a couple other stores on my own after fiancee went to work. Anxiety wasn't great though, and decided to stop in at an urgent care clinic on the way home. I explained the events of the last several days, but didn't have the wherewithal to provide the broader context. Was prescribed 0.5 mg Xanax to take as needed, but I am wary about getting it filled as I know I'd likely get dependent very quickly.

* 27 Friday: Once again, marginally better morning, minus the headache. Decide to take ibuprofen for it, which helps somewhat. Started taking multivitamins again. Still general restlessness and skittishness. Ran 5 miles in the afternoon, went out to run an errand. After laying down however, a got a surge of anxiety which led to a panic attack. Called paramedics, they did an EKG which of course was totally fine. All my vitals were pretty amazing, they said. So off they went. My nerves were frayed through the end of the night.

* 28 Saturday: Nerves back up again in the morning, of course. Decided to write you fine folk.

Any insight, help, or even just encouragement would be great. "

My mom passed when I was 18, about 2 months after I graduated high school, so I immediately was living on my own with my girlfriend (who is now my wife), and that's where it really began. It took me about 5 years to really deal with that, and is still a sore subject for me to this day. Fast forwarding a bit, 6 1/2 years later after that happened, I have 3 kids, and having marital problems resulting in divorce (which hasnt happened yet, but soon will). My marriage has been on the rocks for the past year, at first I was highly depressed, I was prescribed lexapro for a few months until I stopped feeling any results from it, then changed to welbuturin and after 3 days on that was hospitalized for suicidal thoughts (not my proudest moment). This was about 4 months ago and since I got out of the hospital I had been off medicine and kind of strolling along, trying to keep my head up and keep on keepin on. Right now my wife and I are still living together, sleeping in the same bed even, kind of acting like everything is okay for the kids (which are now ages 5, 3, and 1) until we actually split up. As every day goes by I feel myself becoming more and more anxious, and at night when I go to bed is when I start to become especially depressed, which I'm not surprised.

I'm relunctant to see a doctor again because I don't want to see the same results as last time, and am really scared that I might do something. I genuinely don't want to hurt myself or anything, just afraid of going down that road again. I also feel like whenever I try to reach out to friends/family when I really need someone, it feels like no one is available, which is why I've come here.

I started taking celexa May 2011 after a life of anxiety and a heavy peak after my parents split and my bf of 3 years left me for another girl. Anyways, sob stories aside, I had been seeing a therapist since summer 2010 (before the storm) and then at college. College actually relieved my anxiety, which surprised me. 

I developed a drinking problem after my boyfriend lied and left me for slutsherface and didn't see a way out, and I had refused medication all my life saying there was ""another way"" but needed a helping hand other than my therapist and took the pill route. I started to take it after taking care of my drinking problem, didn't want to have that affecting celexa, but the anxiety persisted (especially at home).

I decided I felt like a zombie. Like my body and my mind were separated and that I was in auto-pilot. I had no sex drive, before and during the meds after starting birth control in 2008. I got off birth control summer 2011 to see if my sex drive would come back to me. Nope.

 I felt like part of my brain, the auto pilot was living life for me. I would write things and forget I wrote them, look down at the screen a few moments later and say ""when did I write that?"" Or be surprised when I had ""lucid"" moments where I feel ""alive"" or so to speak. Present is probably the better term. 

My emotional response to things is to turn off the emotion or so it seems. I used to be very in tune with my emotions, but now I go numb and just go into screen saver like an idle computer.

Drinking 3 beers put me in such a sleepy state that I have to be careful when I go out and can't for very long if I plan to drink. 

I couldn't deal with being a shell anymore, and I got off celexa by tapering with advice from online (stupid I know but I was studying abroad and didn't want to pay 100 bucks to see a doctor to tell me how to do it). October 2011. 


I still feel the way I did on celexa. 

Although my anxiety has improved and I am a lot healthier and more content with my life. I still feel zombie-like. 

Empty shell in auto pilot that feels separated mentally and physically with no sex drive, that sleeps a lot and can sit thinking about nothing for a half hour without realizing it. 

I drink less than a liter of beer in 2 hours and I feel like I'm going to collapse from exhaustion. I just turned 21 and have been drinking since I was 17. My boyfriend says it could be ""my age"" that causes this, but I never had a problem with getting tired after 3 beers before in my life until Celexa.

People have noticed a positive difference, I try to act like it's all normal and I'm healthy again, but I feel horrible. My brain just feels different than before and I hate this. I hate this.


Anyone ever dealt with this before? Advice?"

Backstory: I've had anxiety attacks as long as i can remember. Last year I decided that I didn't want to rely on medication for this anymore and prompted instead for finding other ways. I talk to a counsellor now, practice stress relieving techniques, but most effectively I bought a cat. His soft fur and warm affection help me calm down more than anything. It's been a rough year and I couldn't have gotten through it without him. I broke up with my long time SO of 4 years in August ( who in retrospect was really abusive), had to move out of our place and back in with my parents, got fired and found a new job, and since that job is a photography studio I've been under a lot of strain from the Christmas season. Since August I've been ok, transitioning and taking each step at a time. I even found a new SO who treats me so well that it blows my mind. I've never had to fight with him about anything, he listens to me and is open to talk if I ever have a problem. This is astonishing since I think I was screamed at about 5 times a week with my last SO. I'm in a really good place now, with everything.

Which is why I'm so mad about breaking last night. It was so stupid. I come home from a night out with my sister and join in on the group call with my SO and our friends to play some video games and tell me SO that we need to finalize our plans for a trip we're taking TOMORROW, when I see a post in the group chat. I recognize it as his alternate reddit username. This is the the one that he used as a throwaway to post a personal story about me (that I agreed to because he said it'd be a throwaway) and some pictures into a thread once upon a time. The thing is, I know he forgot to log out and back into his real account for a while after that post and ended up using it for the majority of the time. I was ok with that since I figured no one knew that he used that one. But then I saw it on the group chat! No context to explain what it was or anything, because it's just a string of numbers and letters, so I tried not to freak, but it has a lot of things in there about me that I don't want my friends to know about! My heart start pounding really hard and my hands feel like they're swelling up or something because they're painful and tingly. I'm getting myself flustered and overwhelmed by the physical reaction of it all and can feel my face getting hot. I'm getting really mad at myself because I know it's an attack, but I don't want to have the attack, this isn't a big enough reason for me to be having one and I don't understand why I can't just force myself to NOT have this happen.  I mean emotionally I'm holding shit down pretty well, because I have no evidence that there is really a problem yet, I've rationalized, but my body is just going off without out. I tried to ask him why it was there in the personal chat, but he didn't notice the messages, so I even had to casually mention that he should check his other messages while on the group call with all my friends, and it was so nerve racking to try and note a personal issue in a group call because I don't want to seem like the crazy girlfriend who bring personal matters to a public forum. So he checks it, and explains that he had to change his password on a video game yesterday and since it's just a string of number and letters that he knew well, that it was the best option. And his friends needed to use his account for a second so he posted it as the password, and apologized for the confusion. That's it. It was nothing. I started freaking out for nothing. And I just want to cry because the attack won't stop now, it's already on a roll and I keep feeling the physical effects of it, I have a headache and I'm nauseated and my cat is nowhere to be found. So I try and talk to my SO about it, (in personal call) and laugh it off and he's being wonderful, but I can't help but make worse and stupidly figure ""hey, you're already in crazy mode, why not just spill out every minute thing that's been bugging you this week"" and I blurt out my frustrations for out trip tomorrow and how I'm frustrated at him that he's not helping and just keep spewing this acidic word vomit at him, that he doesn't deserve. He's still being wonderful and apologizes and helps me finish the planning and there's no problems to be had for anyone. But my body still continues. I go to sleep and wake up this morning and lo and behold the effects of the attack are still working their way through my system, I have a headache still and no urge to leave my bed, when I know there's a thousand things to do... So I'm writing this is hopes I feel better. I do. Thank you to anyone who actually read through all that.

TL;DR: I have an attack over absolutely NOTHING. I'm mad at myself that even though I can rationalize and sort out my emotions, that my body still has the full reaction of an attack, and there's nothing I can do to stop it. And mostly ranting."

202,0.4020625387012124,0.5979374612987872,0.12,0.792,0.088,"Hi everyone.
I've been pretty anxious for as long as I can remember. Things made me more nervous than most kids my age. I had a really great home life so I can't seem to figure out where it came from.

As a child I had no traumatic experiences. Both my parents were/are still together. Both loved me and treated me great. I was never poverty stricken. I did average/well in school and in sports and always had friends. My little brother was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was two and my little sister was born with a developmental delay (it takes her longer to process things). But, aside from my two siblings slight disabilities I can't think of anything that would of triggered my anxiety.

The first incidence I can remember where I was really was anxious was when I saw something on the news when I was about 5 or 6. Something about public pools being contaminated because little kids were peeing in them and then the public pools weren't using enough chlorine to kill the germs? Anyways I had gone to a public pool (YMCA)  few days before I saw the news on the subject. I think I overheard a symptom being dry or rashed skin.. and I guess I thought I had contracted something from the pool (when in reality my skin was just a little dry and had some bumps?) I wouldn't wear dresses, shorts or skirts at all that summer. I remember only wearing pants because I didn't want anyone to see my skin. I was so scared to go to the doctor and for them to tell me I had contracted some disease. What 5 year old worries about that?!

The next issue with anxiety I remember was after September 11th. I was in 5th grade (about 10 years old) and I remember not being able to sleep in my own bed for weeks. I would lay in bed and envision a plane crashing into my house.

After that around the age of 14 or 15 I watched some video in health about a variety of diseases..one section was targeting breast cancer. I would touch my chest all the time and think I felt a lump when I didn't I was scared to go to the doctor and for them to say I had a tumor or something.

Throughout the years I had a variety of anxious behavior but the worst time was just a few years ago when I got high for the first time. I had smoked weed a couple times before.. I think I tried it when I was 17 but I don't think I ever inhaled properly to get high. About 2 1/2 years ago I drank a decent about and then smoked weed at a friends apartment. I literally had an out of body experience. (I didn't even know that was possible?) But I felt like I was in a dream and couldn't wake up. I kept thinking of the worst thing that could happen. My heart was beating out of my chest and I literally thought I was having a heart attack. My boyfriend gave me water and I was trying to relax. I literally can't explain how I felt. It was like nothing was real..yuck even thinking about it gives me anxiety.

The whole next day I was in a fog. I just kept thinking how I felt that night and it was like by thinking about it I could almost bring myself back to that place and how I felt. Anyone know what I mean? After that day the way I saw the world was different. It's like now I can almost ""make"" myself feel how I felt when I was stoned. I obviously don't want to.. but sometimes when I'm really tired, or zoned out, or it's late, or if I've had a drink or two I get back to that horrible anxious place. (By the way I know it was just weed and nothing else mixed in because my boyfriend and our close friends all smoked and were fine. I have also tried smoking a few times since then to see if it happened again and it did. I obviously don't smoke now)

So basically the point of this post was to see if anyone has any advice or has felt anything similar. Obviously the awesome people here have experienced anxiety, but I'm talking about how the way I smoked effected me so much and almost triggered me to having worse anxiety.

I have a friend who can't smoke because it gives him anxiety, but no one I've talked to experiences a weird fog like anxiety level when there's no smoking involved.

I always think the worst thing could happen but it's so odd because my life is so normal. I'm almost 22 (female) I'm graduating from a university with my bachelors in May. I have a great job- one that will promote me when I graduate. I have a loving and supporting family, and an awesome boyfriend whom I'm moving in with in a few weeks. It's just these anxious thoughts pop in when I'm not really busy..when I have time to let my mind wander. I get anxiety about the world ending, about cancer, about severe storms.. everything :( I just don't know what to do and if anyone has experienced anything similar.

EDIT: Also, I've never been to therapy, or been on any medication."

I know it seems slightly pessimistic and for all of the ""suffers"" probably a bit misconstrued because, ""we're actually inflicted!"". I have recently been tossing this idea around in my head considering that I have been in a struggle with what I believed to be depression/anxiety/ocd...etc, and I thought that my life wasn't in my own control anymore. It seemed that I might as well hand over my ability to reason to my newly anointed ""crazy, endlessly-running, sad"" mind. This was my exact thought process for a year and a half up until now. 

I found the idea to call myself mentally unstable after I seemingly lost control of my thought process and allowed dark, repressed thoughts to take the reins over a couple weeks time until one day where I caved. The year before this I had walked onto a Division 1 mid-major swim team without prior training aside from dedicating every minute of my previous summer to transforming myself into a grade A athlete. My mind was focused on nothing else and this was good for me, as I had finally found a way to disassociate myself from my half year of sadness after a breakup and a shitty freshman roommate. My sophomore year was promising, as I began the year with the least experience, the best build and a whole lot of room for improvement on the team. Come the third month of training and my season is plagued by a very fucked shoulder and I was forced to watch my teammates succeed from the bench, not to mention I had just recently tried to find happiness in one of the most beautiful girls I have ever known. I tried to repeat my prior relationship the same way as my first and immediately my infidelities came out. She obviously was excited at first but saw my sad motives and moved on. At the end of the year I knew that my athletic career was over and I had literally no clue where I stood with women, not to mention I had developed a weird anxiety where I was constantly checking to make sure I wasn't going to piss myself in class. God Dammit. I basically thought I had no hope for anything. Later on I broke down to my parents about how scared this made me feel while omitting the anxiety issues. I lost all hope for life and I was sad as shit. 

Enter the summer before junior year and I have started my first internship with a broken ego. My boss was quite possibly the most abusive person I think I will ever meet and one of my coworkers was a closet homosexual. I know that's a brash thing to say but it was discussed around the workplace and it was quite obvious. The reason that is relevant is because of a developed new thought process that made me terrified of becoming gay. Funny, right? I had never had these thoughts previous and became terrified of myself. The sheer thought of homosexuality destroyed my well being and it made me turn from a confident individual who had never had any issues being outgoing into a nervous, shy person who would have rather sat in my room and stare off into space. Fast forward past the summer and I had scavenged the internet for the ""answers"" to what was going on. This was on top of the fact that I had entered myself into a peer-pressured lifestyle of a fraternity. I unfortunately and fortunately am one of the better looking guys at my school and felt pressure from everyone I knew, even when it wasn't as present as I made it out to be. I would later on learn that this pressure was a self-pursued fantasy. Good-looking people can still be scared shit-less, when approaching the opposite sex when sober.

H.O.C.D. and Depression: ""A debilitating combo that affects very few OCD sufferers around the world. The normal patient has constant spikes in anxiety when placed in a situation involving sexual contact or where possible sexual connotations are present. Usually the patient is not gay and has never had previous desires for homosexual contact. The patient must go through a series of Cognitive therapy practices and medication must be supplemented to overcome these harmful thoughts."" Perfect, I found my answer. I was an OCD kid who simply couldn't get rid of some thoughts. Now remember, I was so deep into my own thoughts that the ""H.O.C.D."" was actually ruining my life. I kept reading deeper and deeper into my issues and decided to couple my new life with a bad habit of smoking weed 2/3 times a day, even after a previous bad experience with pot immediately following my first breakup. I thought to much, cast my health to the dregs and made bad decisions all year. I played friendship like it was an instrument and didn't really hold anything dear. It was like I had thrown in the towel and allowed my thoughts to capture who I actually was. 

I knew I needed help, so I went to see a therapist at school. It seemed like the perfect chance to take a step to recovery, even though I still had no genuine understanding of my issues but still a good opportunity. The only issue was that I was assigned a gay therapist. Perfect. I gave him half assed answers the entire time and eventually gave up on the sessions without disclosing my OCD fears. 

Fast-forward into the spring and was at a loss for what I was going to do with myself. I hated myself, It felt like there was nothing I could do and the fact that I kept reading into my issues from other peoples, similar but still subjective problems, did not help. The next summer came and my anxiety was at an all time high. I vividly remember having horrific panic attacks, where my body was almost uncontrollable. I hated where I was and I hated who I had become. 

This past fall, I finally found some courage to change my life. I went to a new therapist and a psychologist at school and told them everything. It felt good and honestly even though I honestly thought I was insane, I definitely noticed a change in my thoughts the day after my sessions. This revelation did come with a price though. The price was a new sense of purpose in life and my submissive anxiety filled character started to fade away. Once I harnessed that, I started smoking less and eventually became more engulfed in my health. I tried acid a few times too, which I thought was just going to make me crazy but it actually did the opposite, It allowed me to grow even when I did have one bad trip. Continue up to now and I have apologized to the people I have hurt, removed some bad seeds from my friendship group and stopped grasping others specific issues as answers to my own issues (I'm looking at you reddit). I have begun to write occasionally and although I still suffer from the occasional bad thought, I find it now more subjective in my case and I rely on myself to change my life and thought process. The things that finally brought me back to some sort of reasonable mental state were not relying on my thoughts to predict my happiness and making my actions key in defining who I actually am. I'm not going to say I'm happy all the time and I'm not going to say I'm sad all the time either, but I have changed and have embraced my growth from youth to manhood as a beautiful part of life, no matter how terrifying it is. I have also realized that being shitty to women and collecting sexual partners is a terrifying way to live life and it won't collect happiness for you, especially if thats not how you lived life upto college. Taking note of the world around me and not fitting all of my problems into each and every single moment of my life has proved key in my recovery. Moving moment to moment is better than continuing a thought filled, action-less life, but then again that's subjective for me. 

P.S. Acid is a beautiful drug and you won't go crazy from it unless you have a legitimate family history of schizophrenia or something of the like. 

TL;DR: OCD and other mental health issues are real, but become exacerbated to the point of finding yourself in a horrible pit of despair. Don't rely on reading others experience to change you, change yourself and trust your instincts over your harmful thoughts. 

I commend you if you actually read all that. Also please note that this isn't my full story, I had a wild year and a half dealing with this so there is more than just this page."

I've had major depression and very slight anxiety (like only in the car) since I was about 15.The last few months I've been having random panic attacks that come out of nowhere, I've been severely depressed, and I have a chronic pain condition that still hasn't been completely diagnosed (they dx'd me with Fibromyalgia and are still doing tests a year later for MS). I'm overwhelmed, in pain, my muscles seize up when I walk so I am basically stuck in bed unless I take a muscle relaxer or smoke some weed. I don't know how to talk to my doctor about pain medication, I've been taking tylenol extra strength and it only barely numbs the pain. My mind is constantly telling me that I can't do it anymore and I'm getting intrusive suicidal thoughts that I can't control. My husband and I got in a fight last night because I went to bed before him and I was really anxious because it's really hard for me to sleep alone. I was really bitter at him because even though I was begging him he just didn't want to lay down with me. I had a breakdown. He ended up trying to leave me but didn't because I was in such a bad state he didn't trust me alone. I can't control my emotions. I don't know what to do I'm terrified of everything, I feel like a burden on everyone, and I don't feel like I'm worth much. I have this constant cold tight feeling in my chest and it won't go away. 

I honestly feel so extremely about to just explode that I feel like I should be sedated so I don't just lose my mind. I'm at work and I've missed so much from being sick, flare ups, anxiety, chronic nausea, migraines, etc., and I'm scared that if I just go to crisis services I'll get fired or I won't make enough for rent this month. I've been seriously thinking about disability, but I make like 50 dollars too much and I work full time. But right now I'm missing almost a day a week, I can barely take care of myself, I feel like I've completely lost my grip on everything. I feel like every day is the last day I can handle. I owe thousands of dollars in medical bills, I need to come up with $2000 upfront for all the testing they want to do for MS, I feel like my husband is miserable and I don't feel like I'm worth much. I don't know what to do. I haven't been on any medication because I can't afford to go back to my doctor, and I really can't miss as much work as I have been. 

Whenever I try to talk to someone, they just tell me how I seem like I'm healthy and well put together and shit, and it makes me ashamed to tell them differently. I don't feel like I can communicate to my counselor how bad it is. She just tells me to work on breathing and says I seem to be doing well. But I'm not. 


I just need to know what the hell I'm supposed to do right now I can't deal with everything anymore.. :("

I'm living at home because I can't work due to my illnesses.  I've talked to my mom a number of times about applying for disability/SSI and she's always said ""It's no use, you'll just get denied, too much work, etc."" but after my psychiatrist strongly recommended it yesterday and said she thinks she can make a good case for me, I'm determined to do it.  

Here's my write up about how my disability affects my day to day life.  Let me know what you think.  If anyone who's familiar with the disability application process has any tips for making it better, please let me know.

&gt; Every day I wake up and getting out of bed feels like a chore.  Sometimes it takes me hours to work up the energy to do it.  Not because I'm still tired but because I feel so emotionally drained and empty right off the bat.  On top of that, I worry.  I worry I'll stand up and twist my ankle and fall.  I worry I'll leave my room to discover something terrible has happened to my family or the world.  I worry about everything that could go wrong that day.  I just feel awful from the moment I get up.
&gt; 
&gt; I spend almost the whole day in my room by myself.  Even being around my family in other parts of the house makes me nervous most the time.   My room is my safe space where I can feel slightly less on edge.  I have no friends to hang out with because I get too nervous meeting new people to actually establish a connection with anyone, so I am isolated.  
&gt; 
&gt; It's near impossible for me to find enjoyment in anything.  I'll lie in bed for hours just staring at the TV because I can't be bothered to do anything else, but it doesn't entertain me.  I just stare blankly.  I don't care about it.  Sometimes after a lot of struggle I can will myself to play a game or something but I rarely enjoy myself doing it.  It makes the time, which always feels to move so slowly, pass a little quicker but I rarely have fun.  I get little to no enjoyment out of the things I supposedly enjoy.   I have no real hobbies because I can't be bothered to do anything.
&gt; 
&gt; I hear voices I shouldn't hear.  They usually make no sense.  ""Radar blue CD patrol!  Don't forget your horse!""  Just nonsense that won't shut up and leave me be.  Oftentimes they aren't pleasant.  They're often reaffirming every negative thing I think about myself, telling me I'm useless, worthless, fat, ugly, annoying.  No one likes me.  I'm a burden on my family.  I'd be better off dead.  I'll never get any better.  The world is ending.  People are watching me.  They can hear me.  I'm not alone.  The voices are loud and angry and they scare me and they don't stop.
&gt; 
&gt; I can never stop the worry, either.  No matter how much I try to focus on other things, the intrusive thoughts always find a way into my head.  I worry about getting hurt.  I could stand up and twist my ankle and fall.  I could trip and smash my head into the floor.  The next time I go somewhere we could get into a car accident.  I could have a brain tumor I don't know about.  I worry about getting old, dying.  I'm terrified of death and I can't stop thinking about it.  I worry about the people I love dying.  Sometimes I start to cry because I can't stop thinking about my parents, sister, grandma, or boyfriend dying.  The thoughts disturb me and I can't get them out of my head. Gruesome images of my pets being harmed pop into my head and repulse me, make me feel physically sick and horrified and there's nothing I can do about it.  I fear terrible things happening to the world, like nuclear war or a comet striking that will wipe out humanity.  I become convinced the world is coming to an end and I can't stop worrying about it.  I fear something happening to my home - a fire or tornado hitting.  My safe place gone, everything I own and that is important to me, gone.  I'd have nothing and nowhere to go and the thought terrifies me.  All my thoughts terrify me and I can't make them stop.
&gt; 
&gt; Then I panic.  I have trouble breathing.  My chest feels tight and painful.  My limbs go numb.  I cry and shake.  I feel like I'm dying, and then I panic more because of my fear of death and it all amplifies.  Sometimes it lasts a few minutes and sometimes it lasts an hour but it feels like days, weeks of agony in just a few minutes.  Can't breathe.  Can't think anything except that I'm dying.  Can't feel anything but my heart pounding, ready to explode.  It happens at least weekly, sometimes multiple times a week, and it's agony every time.
&gt; 
&gt; I avoid going out places at all costs.  As soon as I get around people the anxiety amplifies and I get more on edge. In crowds I feel like I'm being smothered.  I become terrified of embarrassing myself in front of people, saying or doing something stupid.  I constantly worry people are judging me for how I look, walk, talk, act.    I become convinced that the people surrounding me can read my thoughts so I have to keep my mind blank.  I can't look at someone and think anything about them because they'll know and they'll think I'm weird or crazy.  I worry something bad will happen while I'm in the store, like a shooter or hostage situation.  I spend the whole time worrying it's going to happen.  I can't talk to people in public by myself either.  My mother has to be standing right there when I check out at the grocery store because I can't do it alone.  I can't talk to strangers without panicking.  I need a chaperone. 
&gt;  
&gt; Whenever I do have to go somewhere I have to go with my mother because I can't drive.  I'm too anxious and panicky to drive.  I'm terrified of having to control a vehicle.  I don't want to get in an accident and get hurt or killed.  I'm convinced I'll accidentally hit another vehicle, pedestrian, or animal.  Even the thought of accidentally hitting an animal makes me sick and so I'm petrified of driving in case it happens.
&gt; 
&gt; I had a job for a few months and it was hell.  It started with just a couple days a week, just six hour days, and that was too many and I had to be cut down to one day a week.  Even that, just six hours a week, and I was miserable.  I would have panic attacks before work every day.  I would be a nervous wreck in the car ride on the way in (Mom driving me of course, since I can't drive).  Once I got there I'd just go emotionally numb.  Everything was so overwhelming - being out of my safe space, being around people I don't know, having to talk to people and do things on my own.  I'd get more and more anxious throughout the day.  I'd shake and get cold sweats and have to cry in the bathroom.  I ended up losing my job and instead of being upset I was relieved.  I could just stay at home where it's safe again.
&gt; 
&gt; Night time is difficult for me.  I get more paranoid at night, and I'm afraid of the dark.  I can't look out windows at night because I'm convinced I will see something or someone staring back at me.  Ghosts, aliens, intruders.  All the curtains have to remain closed at night because I can't look out.  As I walk through the dark house I need to turn on every light I can to reveal anyone or anything that might be lurking in the shadows.  I'm afraid to look behind me because I worry something is there, watching me.  
&gt; 
&gt; I can't go to sleep without something on the TV to provide light and noise or it's too dark and quiet and I worry things are watching me and listening to me.  Oftentimes once I close my eyes I'm terrified to open them again because I become convinced that when I do, there will be something/someone there over my bed staring at me, watching me try to sleep.  I fall asleep each night terrified and worrying again, always worrying.

&gt; I often have nightmares of all the things I'm afraid of happening.  I thrash and moan in my sleep and wake up with my arms scratched up from clawing at myself.

&gt; Then the next day it all happens again.  I feel dead and empty inside.  Can't be bothered to do anything.  Nothing is enjoyable and all I do is worry.  It's miserable and no way to live.
&gt; 
&gt; I've been on countless medications and few things have helped.  I've been seeing psychiatrists and therapists since I was 11 and they've given me so many different pills and treatments and nothing helps.  I've been hospitalized multiple times and would always leave in the same state I entered in because nothing they did made any difference.  
&gt; 
&gt; I'm on medications now and they barely help.  They quiet the voices a bit and take the edge off to a degree but I'm still constantly plagued with the intrusive thoughts and fears.  I'm still hard pressed to enjoy anything.  I still barely know what fun is.  I still loathe myself.  There's still always that underlying level of anxiousness and depression.
&gt; 
&gt; I worry I'll never get better.

I've been off my meds for a really long time- almost two years. During those two years, I was out of school and didn't really need the medications to help me through it. Well, I decided to go back to school this summer, and realized that I would need meds as well.

I had a ton of anxiety about seeing my doctor again. I was on antidepressants, but had abruptly stopped taking them. I was worried that my doctor would judge me for quitting them, and wouldn't want to give me any more meds because I would stop taking them. So I let a long time pass, being too afraid to call and I let myself drown in all the ""what ifs""

I finally made an appointment and saw my doctor today. She wasn't at all angry that I went off my antidepressants. She helped me get the medications that I do need, the ones I feel actually work for me. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share my victory, I know it doesn't seem like a big deal or anything, but I was seriously stressed about this for a very long time. Maybe it will inspire anyone else in a similar situation.

Even though I could feel my legs walking it felt like I wasn't actually moving. I had to stop right there and rest with my hands on my knees panting before I could regain the state of mind to walk back to my dorm. The rest of the year went terrible and was filled with more anxiety, panic attacks and depression until I dropped out of college.

I'm on meds (effexor) and have seen two separate psychologists. Both have diagnosed me with severe social anxiety disorder and mild generalized anxiety. 

I currently feel like my condition is becoming worse. Any topic having to do with death, existence, the nature of reality, etc. triggers fear in my mind and I feel pathetic admitting it. I even lied to my psychologists about it saying I was having panic attacks over 'test grades' and 'schoolwork'.

Now that I am not longer being ""protected"" from my anxiety by Effexor, I have been having very intense anxiety attacks almost everyday.


My anxiety attacks tend to run for 1-2 hours and are essentially composed of hyperventilating, intense itching, being bothered by my clothing, claustrophobia, sensitivity to sound, anger, crying, wanting to kill myself. 


I usually take a GABA and lie in my bed until I come down from it.


I haven't had attacks like this since 2.5 years ago before I started taking medication and the only way I had of dealing with it then was cutting myself. I haven't self harmed for over a year now and it is obviously not a good way of handling my problem. So essentially I have no idea how to deal with this, and it is extremely detrimental to my day to day life. Which brings me to my question: 


Does anyone have any methods of calming themselves down from these types of symptoms? (Particularly if anyone has experience with the itching/ being frustrated by clothing.) Is it even possible to do without meds? Or do I have to start something new? 


Sorry if any of this is hard to read/ incoherent. I'm still kind of having an anxiety attack and am having trouble concentrating.

217,0.9990866364146183,0.000913363585372543,0.27,0.668,0.062,"Hi /r/anxiety,

So I had my first visit with my new doctor as the last one I didn't like because he seemed to not really give a shit about what I said was wrong.

Usual questions at first, what medications do you take etc.  Told him I take Adderall XR for my ADHD as-needed for work/school and I was given a few Xanax as-needed from the ER after a particularly bad panic attack I had recently (been starting to get them recently, same age my sister started).

The second I said Xanax and panic attacks he instantly did the same thing the past two doctors have done when they are mentioned ""Okay first thing you need to do is stop taking Xanax immediately, its a bad drug.""  First thing I thought was ""Oh boy.. this again.."" he then asked exactly what I was feeling during what I called a panic attack and said ""Okay look, you need to get out of this mindset you have that when your heart races a little or you get a little bit scared that its a panic attack.  You need to stop calling those panic attacks."".  After which I started to feel shitty and anxious because I felt like I was being accused of bullshitting on what's wrong with me, to which he said ""You are a very nervous and anxious man."".  Yes, because I'm sure most people when being told what they are feeling is made-up or playing down how awful they feel from it wouldn't get a bit defensive or nervous.

Hearing that honestly caught me off-guard, I've had doctors (or my psychiatrist even) be wary of prescribing Xanax, but not essentially just flat out call my fucking panic attacks bullshit.  I KNOW the difference between a little bit of anxiety and a panic attack, not to mention I have had a Psychiatrist, Therapist and the doctor during the ER visit confirm these recent occurrences were panic attacks.  Borderline passing out/passing out, extreme panic and feeling like I'm going to die for 45min-4 hours is not some ""heart races a little or a little bit scared."".  The second I even mentioned I see a Psychiatrist he got this slight rolled-eye look on his face and began asking for his phone#, office &amp; name.

I'm so sick of this shit.  I wish I could have my Psychiatrist be a doctor for everything because nearly every doctor I've ever come across always talks down to me after I tell them whats going on and plays down any anxiety, ADHD or depression issues I have (depression thankfully the past).  I'm sick and tired of the two times I've gone to ER for panic attacks and given Xanax that the pharmacist talks down to me like I'm only getting the pills for the purpose of abuse, when it's just so I don't pass out from a bad panic attack.  I feel like these are supposed to be some of the people that help me GET BETTER, not just make me worse and feel like I'm crazy, an outcast or over-exaggerating my issues.  "

I am still a little apprehensive about this stuff. I am scared it is going to change who I am as a person, not necessarily improve me. 

So far, for side effects, I just have a headache. Other than that I just feel tired. Although thats just the anxiety related insomnia I have been experiencing for months.

It happens when I get angry, when someone confronts me, and recently, when ANYONE that is not a student comes into my classroom. (I'm a high school teacher.) It's absolutely ridiculous, but I blush from the top of my head to my fingers- and for no real cognitive reason. It doesn't start off as embarrassment, but it ends up that way. (My chest, arms, neck, etc but especially my face and my ears- turn MAGENTA.) 

Then, my students want to know what's going on and why I'm changing to unhealthy shades of red. Which of course makes everything worse. 

So- my question is this- does this happen to anyone else? And if so, is there anything that you've found to work in the moment? For me it's like, I'm triggered by someone coming in my room, I realize that I'm turning a bit red which makes me more nervous, then everyone around me realizes that I'm turning colors and make comments, and then...it takes me a few minutes to regain composure but by that point usually the person is gone.

I have GAD and it was pretty out of control until mid-July when I went on meds. They have helped immensely, but one thing that still creates a lot of anxiety for me is college. I understand it is a stressful thing for any high school student to think about, but even just meeting with my college counselor or working on my essays, or reading the Fiske guide to schools makes me feel like I'm about to have a panic attack (heavy breathing, trouble breathing, crying, etc.). Sometimes just thinking about it sends me into a tizzy. There have been multiple nights I've been doing something unrelated and suddenly start getting really upset and anxious over college, to the point of crying and just feeling really down/anxious.

I don't feel pressured to go to a 'good' school. I am a good student and am confident I can get into the schools I have liked so far.
My anxiety is more 'what if I never find the right school for me', 'what if I hate it anywhere I go', 'what if my top choice turns out to be a horrible fit for me and I don't like it', 'what if I don't make friends I like', 'what if I could have a better time somewhere else',' all my friends from HS will definitely have a better time than I will', etc. A lot of the anxiety is surrounding what the lifestyle of college will be like for me. I even feel anxious about my top choice so far, which is frustrating. Any excitement I feel about college will be quickly replaced with anxiety and thoughts of worst case scenarios. 

In addition to GAD I have some separation anxiety as well as social anxiety. I have always been very resistant to change and leaving for college will be the biggest change I have experienced in my almost 18 years. I have lived in the same town my whole life and gone to school with the same people since pre-k. These are definitely playing into my feelings regarding college.

I have petulant BPD, MD, GAD, PTSD, and a lot of nausea/gastrointestinal distress. I have taken god knows how many prescription meds (Paxil and Wellbutrin, currently) and struggled through 10 years of therapy, including DBT, but I'm not doing so hot right now.
I seem to only be able to manage having good physical health, good mental health, and good grades (undergrad senior who will be staying a fifth year to boost dat GPA)- but only one at a time.

I got a 3.93 last semester (highest ever for me, 18 credits, heck yes), BUT now my moods and sleep schedule are wonky and it makes eating and staying healthy difficult. Because I don't get enough/get weird sleep, I feel nauseous, which makes me not want to eat, which deprives my body of nutrients, which makes me tired and weak, which continues the cycle.

I'm stuck, have had some bad BPD breakdowns and have struggled with finding motivation to survive and thrive.

-THEN-

I found Malibu Vista. It's an all-women mental health rehab center in California that helps women with mood disorders and anxiety and personality disorders. It has movement classes and yoga, individual and group therapy, and a very relaxing, holistic and natural ""healing"" vibe to it that you just don't get in inpatient psychiatric care. I believe you stay for weeks-months.

I work very hard to train myself and learn new things about my illnesses and how to cope with them, and this place basically sounds like the reset button I so desperately need. It will help my sleep schedule, get me eating healthy and regularly again (5'1 and 103 lbs right now, need to get a bit more), and provide me with the kind of environment I need to dig down and deal with some of issues that are still plaguing me today. I need more than just treating my symptoms, I need to HEAL and make real progress.

-BUT-

It's expensive. Very expensive. My insurance won't get back to me about coverage until later tonight, but even if it covers some, the out of pocket expenses are too much for me. It would cost over $55,000 for me to get the treatment I need, MAYBE $15,000-35,000 after insurance.

-YET-

I won't give up. I have planned out time and time again the ideal ""program retreat"" for my wellbeing, starting with resetting my sleep schedule, getting back into exercise once I am eating more again, and working on meditation/reflection/healing. The only problem is that I don't have the time to devote to creating my own program at home, and it wouldn't have the kind of support and therapy system I'm looking for. I called my mom today lamenting that no such place exists, only drug rehab centers, when I stumbled upon Malibu Vista. While we both agree that it sounds like the perfect, life-changing fit for me, it's financially out of the option.

-SO-

I want to start a kickstarter or gofundme. If people want to pay for other things, why wouldn't they invest in helping change someone's life who can't pay for the treatment they need? I thought it sounded worth a try, but I have NO IDEA how those sites work. I was thinking of setting the goal at $60,000 to cover the 5% cost of use, but I feel so incredibly selfish asking for money. But I need it, so I'm gonna try.
Does anyone know how to help me? I appreciate just having someone read this even.

TL;DR I have mental health disorders and found the treatment center that is exactly what I need but costs hella $$$ and I'm trying to start a crowdfund but don't know how. Thank you!"

Not sure if its part of a more serious neurological issue (hopefully not) or anxiety (not to downplay anxiety at all, i know how difficult it can be). I'll spare you guys the details on how i got to the point im at now, but im just wondering if anyone has experienced similar symptoms as me. 

My most prominent symptom is memory loss. I cant recall things Ive done only moments ago. I close FB, instagram, or reddit and i wont be able to tell you any of the stories or posts ive just read. I have Cystic Fibrosis also which requires me to do breathing treatments and i wont remember anything about it. I cant remember putting the medication in or actually sitting there doing it. 

My perception of time is also very off. Without looking at a watch i have trouble telling the difference between what is 10 minutes or 30 minutes. I cant  sit there and say, ""It FEELS like i talked to steve an hour ago"". I'll usually be able to recall parts of the conversation, but when  trying to think back on it i'll almost feel a certain level of detachment. Like a disconnect in my memory somewhere. Not sure if that makes sense. 

Also feeling very disoriented/confused. Normal things such as filling out a doctors form has become kind of difficult. Following plots to simple movies or even comprehending news articles has become challenging and frustrating. 

I don't know anyone with dementia, but 9 out of 10 symptoms im having match the symptoms for that. I've had an MRI, CT scan, X-ray, heart monitor, blood work, and am getting a EEG tomorrow. They all came back normal. Im just concerned because of the abrupt nature of all my symptoms (All started within the last month, Jan 20th i believe.  Functioning totally normal before then) if my brain would show any damage due to dementia. I dont know how long you have to have it for for it to show physical evidence on an MRI. 

Ive always been kinda stressed and had slight anxiety due to my health, but nothing that even came close to interfering with normal life. I lost my mom and brother a few years back and never sought help for it and am just wondering if my stress and anxiety snowballed into whats happening now. I was very close to both of them, but felt i dealt with their passings well. I have a few medical conditions that i often stress about too, but never thought i was overwhelmed with anxiety cause of them. 

Im just wondering if anyone has had similar symptoms or might have symptoms that don't fit the ""normal"" description of anxiety. My anxiety during most of this has been very bad. I  do have days where my anxiety is better but my neurological symptoms are still present. Is that possible? To have the physical or neurological manifested symptoms still be present despite not feeling anxious? Any input would help out immensely. Thanks in advance for any feedback. 

TL;DR- Experiencing memory loss, confusion/disorientation, warped perception of time along with other neurological symptoms. Abrupt onset of all symptoms (about a month ago). Feels almost like what i believe dementia would feel like. looking to see if anyone else has had similar symptoms before.  "

I went over to give him and hug and a kiss on the cheek like I usually do and he turned his mouth and tried to kiss me...open mouth! That's not the worst part. He also rubbed my boob. I don't know what to think or do about this. Would it be better to just not say anything about it? He is really old and just started a new medicine so I don't know if it was making him feel loopy or what. But he also said ""I probably shouldn't be doing this."" as he did it so I kind of feel like he knew what he was doing and that it was wrong. I feel like crap for not saying anything to anyone but I think it might be worse if I do say something. I am afraid my husband won't let me go over there anymore without him but his grandma and I are really close. I am afraid to say anything to her because I feel like she will be embarrassed by it. Someone just tell me what to do. Is keeping it in the right thing?"

Long story short, I have a constantly transient anxiety disorder (no idea when the next blow up will be, triggers are sometime random, sometimes not) OCD, (no rituals, just horrid cyclic thoughts) major depressive, and a panic disorder with mild agoraphobia.  Because MI never likes to come alone, I guess? 
I just finished 8 months of adult education, and was insanely proud of myself for finishing it. I'm not currently medicated, and am terrified of my doctor. I was doing really, really well, and feeling pretty good about myself for a while....

But school is over. I can't find a job. I'm terrified to go to my doctor, and I can feel my control slipping.   I'm always worse in the winter, so I know to prepare myself for that...I just...    Everything feel awful and I can figure it out.    This should be old hat to me by now. 

I have  a weird pain in my right leg, below and to the right of my knee ( top right of my calf, I guess) and it just will not go away. It's a strong ache, and probably nothing, but my brain keeps screaming 'blood clot' (which I know is wholly irrational, especially considering I have medical training to spot these things...)  worst thing is, I don't know why it's hurting. I didn't do anything to my leg, or fall, nothing. 
There's also a tiny little red spot on my left boob, like 2 inches below my nip.  I panicked when I saw it, but my SO is 100% that it's just a random ingrown hair or something minuscule and non-lethal. My brain, however, tells me it Must be ALL THE CANCER. 
 
These are two minor, very small things, but I can't stop obsessing over them. The only time I go outside is to take the dog out (and chain smoke while we're out there) 

I feel like I'm unravelling everything I accomplished this year, and I know I should see my doctor, and talk about meds, but I'm too afraid/ashamed to even call.  Which is also how I know I've let this go too long, and I'm probably doing worse than I though I was.  

My SO is a saint for putting up with this crap, and reassuring me everything night that I'm not going to die, that I'm not sick, and that everything will be ok...but it's not right to just rely on him.  
I need to get out of my headspace, and I don't know why I can't. I've done this before. I've overcome this a thousand times. Why is this time so terrifying and hard?????

I don't know what to do, and I hate myself for not taking better care of me, or noticing this sooner. "

I'm close to being off as my doctor and I thought it worth an attempt to get off medicine and see how that goes. I was originally on medicine for anxiety. I thought that it was episodic and would go away once certain stressors were removed. Now I'm not so sure that will be the case. 

I find myself depressed often. My anxiety is returning a little. I attribute this to the phasing down of the SSRI medicine. Fortunately my sexual libido has returned and the weight is stabilized for now. I think I need to go back onto medicine and I want to switch to something different. 

I'm angry and irritable all the time now. A lot of things upset me and I feel as though I could blow up on someone in the line of fire. I posted it here instead of /depression because I thought it fit more here - it could probably be either.

I'm 17 and have been dealing with what I guess you would call social anxiety, which is odd because I come off as a pretty confident person, although on the inside I'm irrationally freaking out. I don't exactly know why I have this irrational fear, or what I'm even afraid of, but the symptoms seem to feed off of each other. I'm a pretty pale individual hehe, no albino, but to the point where if I'm flushed, it's visible. So the anxiety will usually flare up, causing me to start sweating considerably,mostly under my armpits regardless of temperature, immediately causing me to become self conscious of this and my appearance, which then causes my face to flush a bit, and it's a vicious cycle that only perpetuates itself. My face will feel really hot and flushed, yet the rest of my body will feel cold and clammy. These symptoms little by little, are pushing me into a more introverted lifestyle, and I can't stand it, I feel like my anxiety has taken a hold of me. I have no idea what options are available to me, I've tried for a couple years to get a grasp on this mentally, but that hasn't worked so in terms of help I'm looking to medication. Anything to stop the sweating which I think in turn would reduce the flushing/heated face feeling? And I'm not sure if this is a situation that deems worthy for anxiety meds, but I'd prefer not to have to take some medication that will numb me and not make me feel anything, although I'm open to anything that will help with any of these symptoms. I'd very much like to take hold of my life and not live in constant, irrational fear anymore."

I will hang out with her at night, we will cuddle and I will feel like I am soaring with the eagle's nest. But the next day I wake up full of doubt if she still even cares about me the way she did the night before, and other stupid little things. If we are texting back and forth and a text takes a little longer for her to send than the previous ones, I worry. I realize this is faulty thinking but cannot overcome it.

I am a married 30 year old female dealing with a Panic Disorder, Anxiety and Depression. 
I have been suffering with these issues since I was a child, but I never took care of it. Everyone (myself included) described me as high strung, a worry wart, and so on. 
I have a knack for talking myself out of the fact that something is wrong.  I would have a panic attack and then deny I even had it a day later. 

I understand now that it was fear. Fear of the reality of the situation.  Fear of the gravity of it all.  Fear of taking the next step. The constant looping doubt in my head, ""What does this mean for me? How will I deal with this? Oh god, making the appointment for a doctor...I don't even know where to begin. How do I get them to believe me? WILL they believe me? I'm sure I'm fine. Other people deal with far worse than me. I'm overreacting. I don't have the money for this anyway. Plus I feel fine today. It's not that bad. I'm fine."" And that's pretty much how I would talk myself out of taking care of my mental health for over 20 years.  

But I was/am not fine. 

The amount of physical ailments I've dealt with over the course of my life is staggering.  Aside from just the panic attacks and depression, I had shingles at 10, multiple outbreaks of hives in high school and college, IBS since high school (and to this day), acid reflux, TMJ, psoriasis flare ups....and so on and so forth. My body has been screaming out for help for years, but I still made excuses.  I even went as far as to get a colonoscopy and endoscopy certain that there was something wrong. But of course, everything came back fine.  The only thing they said to me after giving me my results is that stress can do a number on your body.  No shit.

Four months ago I finally took my mental health seriously after a very intense breakdown. It was probably one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in my life.  I had to be really honest with myself and say, ""I can't live like this anymore. I have a problem, and I need help.""  

It was SO difficult to make that step to do research and call doctor after doctor just trying to get in as soon as possible so that I wouldn't end up making an excuse and not go. 

But I went. And what an amazing experience.  To have someone look you in the eyes and believe you, and validate you and to know you're not alone and that you have a chance at a ""normal"" (whatever that is) life.  

For the first time in my life I have a name for what I'm dealing with. I can recognize it. I'm learning to not let it control me. It is a struggle for sure, and it's like being in school again.  I have to relearn everything it seems. But it's worth it.

I go to counseling once a week, I'm learning to meditate and be mindful, I'm eating healthy, and I am also on Zoloft.  I used to be judgmental and scared of anti depressants, but I was so desperate with this last meltdown that I was open to anything at that point.  I will no longer judge these medications.  It's like a whole new world has opened up for me.  Of course there are side affects and it's not perfect, but it sure as shit is better than dealing with it on my own. I'm going to attack this shit at every angle! 

I hope that with this post someone will find the inspiration to just go ahead and make that call.  Take that step.  I wish someone had pushed me and encouraged me earlier in my life. But at least I'm doing it now. Better late than never!!

I'm a seventeen year old girl and I've been dealing with ""depression/anxiety like"" symptoms almost all my life, however only recently diagnosed on having a disorder. 

I'm on two anti anxiety/ depression medications and they seem to help for the most part. (Along with exercises and eating right)

The main triggers for my panic attacks are events/thoughts I can't control. 

To my main point. I don't consider myself to be a clingy person. I don't enjoy people hanging off my for hugs, or, any unwanted  touching. &gt;.&lt;

I've being ""with"" my boyfriend for about 4 months now and I love being around him. So much so that it makes me physically sick when he leaves. I'm scared that something might happen to him and I won't be able to protect him or vice versa. 

He is a few years older than me. We have an appointment tomorrow to look at a basement suite for him. I'm excited that he's looking, but I'm nervous that it might not be safe. What it there's a fire? Murderous landlords that live upstairs? Carbon minoxcode? The list gets ridicules at parts. :P

I just want to be around him all the time. He's the one person who I feel makes me truly happy at this point in my life. I don't really know what to think. 


Anyways. Thank you for reading and attempting to help. (:"
235,0.9799710641236745,0.02002893587633825,0.135,0.7,0.165,"So I will start with what I feel was the onset of my anxiety and go from there.  I also think it's important to note that my maternal grandmother has extreme anxiety and is a hypochondriac (undiagnosed, but undeniably exists). My mother has diagnosed anxiety and takes medication for it; but the level of anxiety appears to lessen with each generation.

I believe the onset was in high school, around age 17.  I would wake up in the morning feeling like I had just smoked weed; similar to a feeling I get when I'm dehydrated like I'm in a dream but I know I'm awake.  Except it would not go away.  I feel like I am always in a dream state--the levels of this feeling vary drastically though.  It's not a feeling of disconnect; it's a feeling of overwhelming consciousness of my self.  Every now and then it will get undeniably intense and I will be obsessed with the thought ""I cannot believe I am talking to this person right now/I cannot believe this person is looking at me and I cannot believe that they feel like anything about being alive or being human is normal.""  It's borderline out of body and I get warm and have to will it away with all my might.

But this is by far the least of my worries or problems; it is only a hindrance when I am forced to speak publicly.  The last speech I ever gave was for a class in high school.  It was a public speaking class and it was my final speech.  I got up in front of everyone, said the first line, then, ""I forgot what else I was going to say."" and returned to my seat.

The part that affects every facet of my life and is nearly impossible for me to articulate is how uncomfortable I am around other humans.  I constantly feel like I'm walking on egg shells.  Everything I say is in hopes of making a good impression and not annoying them.  But the ironic part is that when it comes down to it, when I'm not around them, I don't care if they like me or not.  I like who I am and I would hate to be someone else.  But I just feel perpetually uncomfortable around even my closest friends; if not especially my closest friends.

I don't change any of my opinions so that they like me either--I don't say I like things just because they do.  I am too comfortable with myself to do that.  This is where it gets really hard to explain.  I don't lie so that they like me--but I am always feeling like whatever I am saying is somehow offensive or annoying or worthless.  I feel like I need to be accommodating to everyone at all times.  But I am not a doormat either. I know this may sound like I'm in denial, but I just feel like I have to be nice and happy all of the time or else everyone is thinking about how mean and horribly boring and pointless I am. But, again, at the same time I don't care; I care about the anxiety it gives me.

I would really really prefer to be by myself maybe 95% of the time.  I am an introvert and I don't think I've ever felt lonely.

My problem with all of this is that I've researched so many anxiety disorders and none fits, some of them may be like 30% similar to what I feel; but the rest is just nothing like me.  I know that not everyone fits their diagnosis perfectly and that there is grey area. A lot of the questionnaires that I've looked at use the word ""fear"" the entire time: ""Do you fear being around strangers?"" -No! I don't--it's not fear! Its an annoyance toward an irrational anxiety that I dread.  It has nothing to do with fear which makes me feel like I'm dealing with something besides anxiety.

I know that a lot of what I said contradicts itself, but that's the best I can do with it for now."

So I used to keep my feelings in a bottle. But that didn't work out very well for me. I got racing thoughts, (that repetitively said 'kill yourself') and told my mom after never having a quiet moment in my own fucking head for almost two-and-a-half weeks.

This got me stuck in a hospital for 3 days. And now I have a dx of generalized anxiety disorder. This was in September.

And now I try to put less in the bottle but it's kinda not working because I end up wearing all of my emotions very close to the surface because I can't seem to find a middle ground between 'fake emotion' and ALL THE EMOTION!!! (Which results in people thinking I'm annoying and hyper)

And I keep getting worked up over the most minor situations. Like I lost my computer charger cable, I freaked out, and then my mom told me that if I didn't stop acting like a two year old then I would have to take medications. But I don't want to take medications and I don't want to see a therapist and she doesn't want to pay for it or have to drive me to a therapist so I'm not going.

But anyway. The main problem is that I can't seem to control myself in situations like this where it seems like my entire life is going to shit but it's just a fucking computer cable. And I realize how stupid it is later but at the time it's the Worst Thing In The World and she tells me I need to get perspective but I don't have any perspective in that moment because I just lost my fucking computer charger and everyone will laugh at me and I won't be able to study for my finals and I'm going to look like an idiot and I've lost something AGAIN and my mom is going to hate me.

In October, I had a panic attack at work and had to go to the hospital because I had no idea what was going on. I got hot, started sweating, my whole body went numb (not like pins and needles but no feeling at all), and I thought I was dying at the moment. 

I still haven't felt like my normal self and it caused my marriage to suffer, mainly because my wife didn't understand, and it was hard for me to explain. I was also suffering bouts of Depersonalization where I felt like I was in a dream state, as well as random bouts of depression. I would not want to do anything but ""relax"" and either sit on the couch or lay in bed. Along with that I just had a feeling of ""I don't care"" and had no feelings towards anything. It was like I was blank. 

I would have good days and decide that there was no need to call a doctor because i feel fine. But it would always come back and I would regret not meeting with my doctor. 

My wife scheduled me for a doctor's appointment this past Monday and went with me. He believes I was suffering from general anxiety and depression. I have been prescribed Sertraline and started that Tuesday. I've been exhausted and I no longer have the numb/light headed feeling of anxiety, but still don't quite feel like myself. I'm on day 4 and I haven't felt exactly the same any of the 4 days I've been taking the medicine. 

I'm hoping everything works out. I've read it can take up to 2 weeks to start feeling a more positive effect of the medicine.

I'm normally fine most of the year, but it comes in bouts. I might even feel fine most of the day during these bouts. I've had it last year once or twice for about a month. 

It's been over a month for the most recent one. I think it's getting better. I've been anxious, on edge, and feeling demotivated. A few times I need to cry, take a drive, or call a family member to calm down. I've been thinking about suicide more, but only in passing. I'm not a risk. I've also been obsessing few different minor health issues that I have and probably don't have. I would spend hours (maybe less) either worrying or checking. 

My worry is that I'm not quite bad enough to be able to seek help. I read the DSM diagnostic criteria and how it must be for more days than not for over 6 months. I can only imagine a therapist meeting where, oh, I feel better and not being able to take anything away from it because I'm not a serious case. Or a psychiatrist who concludes medicine isn't a good fit because I'm fine most of the time and to just suck it up.

and how should attempt to get help, if I can? Should I get a referral from my GP or just ask insurance? I assume I would be covered either way. Is there a reason I would not want to go through my GP? Does this keep it ""separate"" more?

I just need to hear from someone who's had a similar experience so I know I'm not crazy and that it will get better!!"

I couldn't find many posts from British hospital experiences so just wanted to put this here in case it helps anyone!

Yesterday I had a General Anaesthetic to remove a cyst in day surgery and I have to say, I was absolutely taken aback by how easy and non terrifying the process was. I had been suffering really awful anxiety in the run up to it, and the fact that the NHS don't tend to give you a lot of information beforehand meant I had googled away and focussed on all kinds of complications and side effects. 

It went like this: I went in at 7.30am and sat on a little ward with around 8 other women. A nurse came around and ran through some basic questions and did my general obs. Then the anaesthetist came around to see me. He was great, immediately reassuring me as I explained my many fears. As it wasn't going to be a long operation I only had to have a soft little tube just at the opening of my throat - no tube into my lungs. He also said that he would give me an anti sickness medication before I came round, and that it wouldn't make me feel woozy or sleepy. 

Then the surgeon came around and explained exactly what she would be doing and answered a few of my questions. 

At about 10am I changed into a gown and got on the bed to be wheeled over for surgery. I panicked a tiny bit at this point and cried a little, but the nurses were fantastic, chatting away and distracting me. In a side room I had a canula inserted by a student doctor. She got it first try and I felt next to nothing. The anaesthetist let me know that he was first giving me a little something to make me relaxed. I told him I was terrified of sedation but he reassured me it was very gentle - more like a large glass of wine, and he was right. I had been worried about the proposition of a pre-med (lots of people in the US mentioned this) I'm not a massive fan of sedatives, and envisioned sitting on a ward freaking out on ativan. But this was 30 seconds of very slight relaxation right before I was put under. The lovely nurse held my hand and I have no memory of the actual anaesthetic going in. 

The next thing I remember is waking up in recovery. This was the part that I'd lost the most sleep over beforehand. But I was really pleasantly surprised. I have a vague memory of the soft airway tube coming out and then I was completely awake. No disorientation, no grogginess, no sickness. I was immediately aware of where I was and what had happened. I wasn't in any pain and didn't feel strange at all. 

The nurse wheeled me back and I hung out on the ward and drank tea and ate biscuits for an hour or two. The surgeon came back around and explained what she'd found and what to expect from the healing process. After another set of obs from the nurse I went on my way around 2pm and my mum drove me home. I felt completely normal and relieved.

Pain has been very minimal and controllable with paracetamol and ibuprofen. This morning I woke up with a slight headache but nothing worse. 

Sorry for the incredibly long post. I know this is a slightly niche area, but I just wanted to post because if I'd have known more what to expect beforehand I would have been able to deal with the horrible anticipation anxiety so much better. "

I've had a really rough past (bullies, abuse) but I can't figure out any triggers for this current episode.

I'm not on any medications at all. I had a bad experience with benzodiazepines and it's put me off of the whole medication thing. I'm currently seeing a psychologist but I won't have another session for a month since she is on vacation. 

**Anyways**, I'm currently at work and have been doing my meditation exercises, but what else can I do to help relax and diminish the feeling while I'm currently at my very professional workplace? How do I not lose my cool? It's been really hard.

On our very first date, he explained to me that he is bipolar and has pretty bad anxiety issues (on medication for both). I was and am fairly understanding of this. I have an academic background in psych, so I've got a bit of head knowledge, and I've also been dealing with anxiety of varying severity as well as occasional manic episodes from age ~20-current, so I have the ""heart"" knowledge - albeit nothing on the same scale as he deals with.

I recently got out of an emotionally manipulative relationship, and he's still recovering from a recent manic episode. As a result, I don't believe either of us are emotionally healthy enough to enter into a relationship, but it's something I'd love for us to work toward and maybe eventually enter into. 

However, doing something like that requires communication, and communication between us about anything involving ""us"" is very difficult as he tends to shut down and become catatonic whenever I try to have a discussion with him about anything between us (granted, we've only known each other for two months, but I think there's been two or three conversations in that vein). I don't present our conversations as things to be afraid of or things that will ruin our friendship - they're just that, conversations, things I bring up because I want to discuss them with him.

His reaction is nearly always the same - he gets a very disconnected look in his eyes and tends to grab at himself like he's cold and trying to rub his arms to warm up. He'll let me touch him or hold him, but often he shakes or twitches a bit like a mild seizure (though not continuous). He'll also only whisper, and only say one of three phrases (either my name, ""I love you"" or ""I'm sorry""). I can't get him to talk to me about *anything*, even little mundane things. He's like this for a very long time - usually I have to leave him alone for a while for him to get back to ""normal"".

Typically after we have a ""conversation"" like this, he apologizes in earnest for how he behaved, but we never revisit the topic of conversation. In other words, we don't really get anywhere. When I ask him what he was thinking when he wasn't talking, he says that he was ""stuck inside his head"" and ""going in thought loops"".

Does anyone have experience talking to someone who has a similar response due to their mental condition? How can I help draw him out of his head and get him to talk to me? The majority of my anxiety issues stem from having scary and unpredictable conversations with my foster parents, so I'd like to think I know the basics of having nonthreatening, constructive ""talks"". I really adore him and want to be able to have a solid relationship someday, but I don't see that happening without the ability to hash things out in conversation...

Thanks so much for any help you can offer. I just don't know what to do when he shuts down.

PS: I know this is probably a bit weighty of a question to be asking after only knowing the guy for two months. We're both in agreement that we feel we've known each other longer, and as a result things have moved a bit quickly. Probably not the best idea in hindsight, but you can't take back things you've already done."

It took YEARS (nearly a decade) to find a good therapist/psychologist combo to diagnose me correctly. I have certain life events that have happened that kick in EXTREME anxiety where I would pretty much stop eating/sleeping and just stress constantly.  This is totally irrational in theory, the events are not that big of a deal to most others which goes to show how biological this situation seems to be.  Fight or Flight 24 hours a day. These episodes if left unchecked (about a week or so) turn into a massive clinical depression lasting anywhere from 3-6 months. Its horrible. I have had 5 of these episodes in the last 15 years. I am now an expert at these sorts of things, taught myself a ton about it so I could talk to good professionals and get help at a point. I finally found a medication and therapist  that works for me (the combo was a complete game changer), my life is 10 fold better and I know many of the triggers that can kick in this anxiety so I can avoid them. I Am still terrified of another episode but I have been THREE years free of them , which is the longest yet.

I have a big problem with public speaking. Everyone gets nervous but I don't see anyone reacting the way I do, which makes me feel even more embarassed.

The problem is that it's affecting my grades (I'm in university and some presentations I give account for 70% of my grade).

I was officially diagnosed with anxiety and OCD by my doctor about a year ago, but it has always been a problem in my life.

Two months ago, I had sex with my boyfriend. It wasn't the first time but for some stupid reason, we decided to not use a condom. 
I am on birth control (for PCOS), there was no ejaculation, and the sex was within the week leading up to my period. Since then I've had two full periods, and my third should be soon. Haven't had sex since, either.
Well a couple weeks ago, my endocrinologist tested my TSH levels and they were low (hyperthyroidism), so he changed my medication (increased metformin and decreased levothyroxine), then I proceeded to go on vacation and LEFT MY ANXIETY MEDS AT HOME.
I've been on the edge of having a serious panic attack for a week now because I keep thinking I'm pregnant, even though in all rationality, I'm probably not. All the meds I'm taking mimic some of the side effects of pregnancy and I'm sufficiently freaked every time one of them makes an appearance.
I need a voice (or two) of reason. I'm going to college in the fall and I really can't deal with this right now, the idea of having a baby is terrifying and I don't know if I can ever have sex again, because this is really screwing with my mind.

I just thought it might be a bit cathartic to write this. I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety a year and a half ago. I went through some meds, none did anything beneficial, a couple had mild side effects like sleeplessness stomach stuff etc., but nothing too bad. 

After trying three meds, my doctor decided to tell me I need to talk to a therapist about the problem and that she would not be able to help me further. This is the doctor that I have been going to for 15 years or so, and I am at least somewhat comfortable with talking to her. I knew that I had anxiety for a year, and started working up the courage to talk to her for six months. 

She told me to talk to a therapist a year ago. I still have not been able to even call to make an appointment. The anxiety has gotten much worse in the mean time, and I have developed what I would consider severe depression as well.

I am currently a second semester senior at a university and am in the middle of applying to a job that I am not at all prepared to be able to do (teach), as well as applying to a masters program in my field. The anxiety from these things being up in the air along with the normal anxiety from school work, being around people, etc. is just about killing me. 

All of this is tagged along with me not being able to see my girlfriend because of overreaching parental issues (I have to live at home to be able to afford my tuition) preventing me from seeing her. She is literally the only person who i feel not anxious, depressed, or bad in the least bit around, and I do not even know when the next time I will be able to see her is. 

All of this has compounded to me (an already obese individual) gaining weight from increased binge eating and sugar consumption with extremely limited exercise (just plain afraid to go outside), which brings the anxiety of clothes not fitting. 

I say all this partially as catharsis, but also to see if anyone could offer any words of help or wisdom. Besides my girlfriend, who I am unable to see, nobody that I have access to is at all sensitive to my issues and maintains the ""just plug through your problems"" mindset which is very hurtful. 

I went back to the doctor today for an unrelated illness and mentioned that I have not been able to call the therapist and was damn near accosted for not having done so and then she begrudgingly prescribed me a new medicine with the requirement that I come back to her in 30 days and having talked to a therapist. 

Between the doctor's disapproval of me and chastisement and my recent weight/clothing issues, I actually started self harming today, and it now bothers me.

I figured after that was all over with it would be easier for me to move on if I just cut all ties with him; ignore his texts, calls, and him in person. So that's what I did. 

It worked, I got over it a lot sooner than I thought. I have a class with him in school and he is always flirting with this girl in there in front of me and telling the teacher stories about him and all these chicks. I knew from the get go it was just to piss me off. (Recently he admitted to it, and said he wont do it again.)

A few days ago I started talking to another guy, Nick. I've talked to him before, but we were both seeing other people and eventually quit talking. But we started back due to us both being now single, and I really like the kid. We've been walking together and holding hands and getting close and what not.

Tyler didn't like this too much, which didn't surprise me. I talked to a couple other guys before Nick though, but he never got quite as mad. Tyler started texting me yesterday and was telling me that Nick was no good, and will only hurt me. Tyler said he was just going to hit it and quit it. 

Nick said he made it seem this way to Tyler so Tyler wouldn't be so mad. Nick admits to everything and says that he truly does like me.

During my texting conversation with Tyler, I had an anxiety attack. It was pretty bad, considering I haven't had one in a while. (I stopped taking my meds because I feel better generally without them).

After my attack, Tyler asks to call me, and I said sure.

We end up staying up until 3:30 talking. Not just about all of the drama but just how our lives are going, and catching up. We both admit to eachother that we still love eachother and miss eachother and just cry to eachother. He asked me if I wanted to get back together. I said yes. He said that we would start dating in a week or so, just to let things die down. I agree. 

In order to date, we would have to be in school dating for a while, and in time go on dates, because I know my family will be pretty pissed if I get back with him due to what he caused me during the break up.

Now, he doesn't know for sure if we should go through with the deal, and neither do I. 

I like Nick, and would gladly date him. But I love Tyler, and always will. He is the only person that can calm my anxiety and I miss him in general. Every little thing about him. His humor, personality, his hugs, holding hands with him, etc.

Most people tell me, don't get back with Tyler, it'll just end the same. I don't think it will. I know it wont be good, family wise because he hurt me. I want to date him again, but I then again I don't.

""Just ignore him again."" It's so fucking hard to just stop here, I still have an ounce of hope. 

I feel bad for basically making Nick wait. I of all people know how fucking depressing that shit is. I don't want him to, but he says he understands.

What should I do reddit? 

TL;DR: Ex is wanting me back after I've found another. I still love my ex, but know it's probably a bad idea.

My pdoc today switched me from Zoloft and Klonopin (because I seem to be developing a tolerance) to Cymbalta and Xanax. 

Does anyone have thoughts on these drugs? 

In the past, Zoloft has worked best with the least amount of side effects. Lexapro, Trazadone, and Wellbutrin did nothing. Paxil and Remeron worked great, but the side effects were unmanageable. Effexor and Abilify both made the anxiety and depression worse.

I woke up in the middle of the night with some mild nausea. Went back to sleep and woke up in the morning with nausea and a slight headache. Throughout the day I've felt pretty nauseated and have had sweaty palms, but now I'm feeling a bit better although I do have a slight headache. 

Now here's my question:
I'm going on a 4 day cruise in 10 days and am thinking I should stop medication until after the cruise. I just read that Lex can cause issues when mixed with alcohol, and while I don't regularly drink, I'm definitely planning on drinking during the cruise. I also don't want to feel nauseated during the cruise and I've read that side effects can increase in severity during the 2nd and 3rd week.

I don't want to wake him up and bother him when attacks hit because I know he needs his sleep just as much as I do, but a lot of the time the only thing that calms me down is to be able to talk to someone. As a ""new"" mom (I use the term loosely because she's not an infant) I don't have many friends I can hang out with. That's normal, I know this, but I don't want my child picking up on the fact that I'm feeling horrible anxiety all of the time. So I usually pretend to be okay and do things with her like playing or watching things. All this alone time makes my anxiety even worse and most of the time I don't want to bother anyone so I never reach out. Though admittedly I definitely should. I'm not on medications right now and can't get on any for a few months at least, so I just have to figure out a way to deal with these I guess.

I wish I had a place like this to go to while I had anxiety and depression, it's an awesome support system, keep it up!
I just wanted to offer some practical tips and ideas for getting through the worst of anxiety, depression, panic ect.

1. Talk to your doctor. 
You have a chemical imbalance that may or may not fix itself. There's no shame in considering medication. Taking medicine turned my life around, find the one that's right for you, I tried three before I found one that doesn't make me hazy.

2. Talk with the ones you love. 
Even though it's hard at first, I found huge relief in explaining exactly how I was feeling to my close friends and family. Also, from talking with them I found a surprising amount of them had at one point had some of the same feelings I was having, which made me feel way less alone.

3. Watch kids movies. :)
 It might sound funny but it helped me a lot. 

4. Be active enough that you want to go to bed at night.
For me, anxiety caused a really unhealthy cycle of staying inside all day, not being tired, laying awake in bed because of anxiety, sleeping in, repeat. Even though it feels like the hardest thing in the world to do, go outside. Walk around, exercise, go to the store, even just driving around. 

5. Wake up everyday and choose to fight it.
This might not be for everyone, but for me, part of getting better was going from being a victim to a fighter. If you have it, you know it's a battle. It's the hardest thing I've ever experienced. So rise above it, be brave, choose to live on in spite of it.

I'm rooting for all of you :) it will get better, keep fighting.

Sorry for the wall of text."

I have never sought professional help for my anxiety, and although this is largely because my anxiety has prevented me from doing so, even when I've felt confident enough I've refused to seek help because I don't want to be put on medication.

It's a subject I'm very cynical about, and feel as if some countries medicate far too readily. Surely if one has a mental problem, allowing your brain to become reliant on medication to correct it is just going to make it impossible to function properly without it?

I think I can understand the point: if you can't lead a normal life because of your anxiety (as I haven't been able to recently), that's surely preferable to the alternative. Still, it's a headache for me to even consider.

I'm curious to know what other people think about this."

At my annual check-up earlier this week, my doctor suggested Ativan to use as needed to help with stress/anxiety from school. I told her I'd have to think about it, since I thought I was okay and that I could calm myself down if I started feeling panicky. I also don't know if Ativan would be covered by our insurance, since I'm still on my parents' and we're not really in a position financially to pay for anything extra right now if it's not covered.

I've been thinking about it, though and I can definitely see times in the near future where it might be helpful to have something, especially since I'm aiming for a couple big leadership positions next school year and an internship this summer. I've never had any kinds of medicine or treatment for anxiety before, mostly because I'm too scared/embarrassed/proud to ask for any (which is stupid, I know), but I also didn't start noticing many problems with anxiety until July 2012. I thought I could deal with it then, but it's only gotten worse. Not as bad as some people I know, but it's awful anyway and I hate feeling like this.

Do you think Ativan is a good idea? What are your experiences with it? My doctor said it's not addictive but I've also been reading about it and I've seen some people say it is and that it's a bear to come off of. And is there anything else I can do to help me deal with these problems?

I’m looking at myself in the reflection of my window. 

*I’m not happy*

Its quarter to 5 in the morning. I spent my night drinking a bit, going to a few parties then going back to my fraternity house to hang out with my friends. 

*I’m happy.*

Last night, I was drunk as hell. I drank a shit ton of beer, was very drunk, ended up taking a girl home and having sex with her. 

*I’m fucking awesome*

I woke up this morning, had sex again, took her to her car… came back… slept… see paragraph 3 for my night so far. 

*I’m pretty “meh”*

I have a life many people would want. I’m not rich by any means, but I am blessed with a great family who love and support me, friends who love and hang out with me, and am currently pursuing a higher education. 

*Ah, fuck.*

*What the hell is wrong with me?*

I can’t study. I can’t go to class. I take that back, I CAN do both of those, but my laziness/anxiety is hindering both. I say “hindering” because I could fight through it, but it’s difficult. 
I keep shoving this taco bell in my mouth like it’s going to make me feel better.

*I’m debating whether or not to crack open another beer. I feel like it will make my writing better… not grammatically, but entertaining.*

For some reason, I’m obsessed with how people view me. To a certain point, that is a normal feeling. People are always worried about what their image is. I think my view is different. I have a huge amount of anxiety about how my classmates, who literally couldn’t give two shits about me, see me. When I skip a class and go back, its not the normal “shit, better get notes from someone” its “holy fuck, everyone in that class is going to see me as a douchebag, failure, fuck up, and tell everyone they know about how that kid with the shaved head skipped class.” So, naturally, my reaction to these thoughts is to never, EVER, go back to that class again. 

*I hate myself.*

*By the way, the beer is cracked.*

*Holy shit, its 5:15.*

*I want to go to sleep, but I’m afraid that when I wake up and become sober ,I won’t be as honest.*

Am I really depressed? The hwole reason I became depressed is because I put off a paper. I put it off, then never did it. And because I didn’t do it, I started skipping that class. “Well, fuck, I’m skipping this class and probably going to fail it, might as well not go to any classes.” Then, started realizing my life was falling apart and broke down.
I brought this on myself and I haven’t learned from it. I know I haven’t learned, because ive been skipping classes this semester… A lot of classes. 
I’m wasting my life.
I’ve always been a shitty student. I can remember the first time I didn’t do an assignment… It was 4th grade, I forgot to draw something ( or whatever) and I pretended to look in my desk for it. I looked frantically, knowing full well there was nothing there, for my missing assignment. I was late for my bus, so I pointed to a girl in my class ( I think it was Kelly) and asked her to look for the assignment. Of course it wasn’t there. Nothing happened. I’m pretty sure nothing happened and I went on with my 4th grade self. Pretty sure that is how my whole “not doing homework” thing started. I say that because 5th grade is when I started having problems with not doing assignments and parents getting involved. I was constantly yelled at and punished, sort of, for not doing my homework. This carried over to high school. I never did homework. I was always brought up during parent-teacher conferences and how I never did anything. Up until my senior year of high school, I never got above a 2.5 GPA. Senior year I had a 3.1. 


Best part is, every year of high school… and college for that matter… I said/say to myself “ this year will be different.” It never is.



*I fucking hate myself.*

So here I am... 23 years old. Starting a new major, won't graduate until after this year, fucking up like I always am. No relative internships in what i'm now going into, shit GPA, and the same old fucking bullshit. Idk what to do.

*fuck*


Edit: Little back story... I was going through depression for most of 2012. Didn't get diagnosed until later in the year after failing 2 semesters of college. I was on medication for about 2 months then stopped. Was a little better when it came to school but still only got like a 2.5 for the semester. I decided to switch my major and go into something different and here i am... 5th year of college, new major, old habits."

I think I have a different perspective now. The medication is allowing me to get to a point where I have the resources to care for myself. I can now make appointments with therapists and coffee dates with friends and actually show up. I can take recommendations of therapists for activities that will help me to work through some of my ""stuff"". For me medication will not be the answer, but it provides a door to a long tunnel to the other side of this mess if I'm willing to do the work.

One day when I was much younger, (I think I was in 4th grade) It was summer break, and I was at my grandmothers house, because they used to watch me and my sister everyday because my parents needed to go to work. During this day, I felt nauseous to the point where I ran to the toilet puking my guts out. Ive vomited many times before this, but this certain day traumatized me. I couldnt stop throwing up, and I kept crying. This scarred me into thinking that the next time I vomit, I wont be able to stop. Eventually it grew into a huge fear, and now anything that relates to vomiting (seeing it, smelling it, hearing it) I get anxious and freak out. 

Now a couple of years ago, I started having extremely bad panic attacks out of the blue, to the point that I am now currently on medication (Lexapro) for it. I have noticed that anytime I get a panic attack, the biggest thought that runs through my mind is that I am going to throw up. This makes the attack MUCH worse, which makes dealing with attacks much harder than they already are.

I just wanted to see if anyone dealt with this as well, as everyone I know thinks I am absolutely crazy about having this fear :/ "

However, my family is not being supportive, at all.  They seem to be making light of the situation or at least helping to make it worse.  I'm stuck in a thought loop based on a couple interactions with my family, and I thought it would really help to get some outside perspective.  

I quit my job about 4 months ago because I did not enjoy it.  My anxiety there got worse and worse everyday, and the worst part was that I was isolated in a cubicle that had no one nearby.  I could go many days at work without speaking to someone as my job was mostly pointless and was scheduled to be part of a layoff/elimination at some point in the future.  The uncertainty of that was too much for me to deal with, so I told my parents that I was quitting because it was causing mental health concerns for myself and I just wanted to be happy and not worry about stuff again.  My mom has been scared her whole life (she also has real bad anxiety) that I will develop a mental illness at some point because her grandpa was scizophrenic.  

They discouraged me from seeing a therapist/taking meds, but this isn't about them, this is about me.  I got a phone call from my older brother last week and he started off the phone call with, ""So mom said you are going insane?""  I said ""What?"" trying to not acknowledge what he was saying.  And he repeated ""Mom said you are going crazy.""  My response was ""I guess.""  

My mom then came over a few days later.  As she was going to leave she says ""Oh I brought some stuff that is about your great grandpa.  But don't read too much into anything.""  She left a stack of papers here basically detailing his stay in mental institutions, his diagnosis and progress overtime, etc.  I feel like I always assume the best intentions for people, but doesn't it seem a little fucked up that she would leave these things with her son who she knows is struggling with anxiety/panic?  Am I being overly paranoid?  

I am planning to tell my therapist this story tomorrow, as if I am actually going crazy, he would be the one that knows right?  Not my highschool drop out brother and anxiety ridden mom?

It just sucks that I feel like I am finally getting the help that I deserve, and the people that are supposed to be there for me are making it impossible.  I feel like I need to cut them out completely in order to return to my old, less worrysome, self.  "

One day he was fine with my ex living with me, the next he wasn't and I had to reassure him. I had to reassure him on every guy friend I had. In the end I started to feel very manipulated and have very recently broken it off. He wants to get back together, I'm pretty sure I don't, but he's agreed to give me space for now.

Our breakup came off the back of a pretty huge fight with him, and a massive fight with my mother, who is the other major hurdle in my life.

The only luxury I allow myself is to get my nails done. I work in a very professional, esteemed environment and I need to not have raggedy nails. Halfway through getting them done with my mum she turns on me, and calls my ex-husband a 'manipulative shit' who is 'ruining your relationship' and how can I 'do that to a man with kids?' That's all I remember, I was in tears after that. The nail lady had to get up and get me a box of tissues.

My mum didn't care. It's always been like this - unload on me until you've had your fill, and then move on. She's gone to Vietnam for 4 weeks so I don't even have the option of talking to her, which I wouldn't anyway. Mainly because the minute I say anything I'm told to get over things. Me holding on to things has become a running joke in my family and I laugh with everyone else but it hurts.

I am also struggling at work. My boss reminds me of my mum in that they both dismiss me because I am an idiot and beneath them. If I don't get something the first time she (my boss) will delegate it to her 2IC and he will need to explain it to me several times because I'm not great at attention to detail, and I am stupid. Because I do not deal with either of them face to face I just get abrupt snarky emails from her and jokes at my expense to lighten the mood from him.

It gets to the point where I'm pretty sure the universe is just laughing at me - ""is this idiot seriously getting out of bed this morning?? WHY??? How many more hints do we need to give her?!""

I have a view to extend my studies in a different area next year which will leave me broke but hopefully happier. 

Anyway, for all of these reasons I've been given free sessions with a counselor, and have taken advantage of the Employee Assistance Program as well. Unfortunately both of these have nearly been exhausted in terms of how many sessions I have left. I'm pretty sure I'm doing it wrong... They all seem hell-bent on this 'mindfulness' stuff and while I hope it helps someone, it doesn't help me.

I don't 'tell' myself negative thoughts in a conscious sense, I just 'know' these things. I don't 'know' it in an emotional sense either, more that I'm just resigned to it. 

I've tried EMDR therapy (after a car accident as a way of dealing with my PTSD) which did nothing. 
I've also tried Lexapro and Zoloft, but I'm not keen on meds and I got off them earlier than recommended (weeks.)

I'm not keen on meds for a few reasons, all of which are my personal beliefs and I don't mean to belittle or offend anyone on them.

Meds only buy you time, you still need to fix the issue. Meds turned me in to a zombie and I watched them do jack-all for my mother for 20 years. Plus, I believe in mind over matter. If I don't believe they work, they won't.

My first major panic attack was last year when I was parking underground during a particularly busy time at the shopping car park. I haven't had my licence for very long and back then i'd had it for maybe a year. I was incredibly nervous about my driving ability to begin with. I tried so hard to get in to this park, cars honking, everyone staring at me, till I was hyperventilating. I'm also diabetic and my sugars were pretty low because I was late for lunch. I smashed my passenger wing mirror against the pillar and eventually some poor 18yo guy had to park my car for me. 

I tried to tell my family, who I was meeting for lunch, but all I got was ""why did you have a panic attack?"" from my older sister and ""well that's silly"" from my mum.

Now it's at the point where I can't go out by myself. The incident I refer to in my first sentence (eons ago, sorry) just happened when I tried to go and do some grocery shopping and had to leave everything. I sprained my ankle last week and still have a bit of a limp. I ended up so self-conscious I had to abandon the shopping trolley, quickly grab the easiest thing for lunch (turns out to be so spicy I can't even eat it) so now I'm at home, hungry and miserable.

 I'm a bit of a chubster, but I can't even go for walks by myself because I *know* people are looking me. I'm usually fine going out with someone else, but don't like exercising with someone else.

I also have major problems with constantly apologising. 

Anyway, sorry for the long ramble. I didn't anticipate it going on so long. I'm not even sure what I'm after. Maybe your stories will help me feel better.

Switching lanes is scary.  Making left turns doubly so.  My heart just starts hammering in my chest and I start seeing every little thing that can go wrong.  The anxiety is enough that I avoid driving whenever possible, but not so much that I can't make a trip down to the store along familiar roads.  I got my license when I was 18 (I'm 26 now) and have never needed to own a car or drive one regularly, so I didn't deal with this anxiety too often.

Until a couple of months ago.  

In July I started working as a nanny, and a part of my job is taking the kids to their activities.  Everything is close by and I was finally feeling comfortable driving (enough so that I made two 200mile round trips to drop off (and pick up) the kids at their moms.  That's 800 miles in three days!).  Anxiety was less.  Highways were no longer intimidating.  I was comfortable switching lanes and making left turns.  I was even thinking about getting my own car (or a scooter).  All was going really well.  

And then I got into a [car accident](http://imgur.com/a/fagYl) last Thursday.  I was going straight under a yellow light (about 50mph) when an on coming minivan took a left.  I hit the brakes but not fast enough - I slammed into her car, which then flipped over.  Had it not been for the seat belts, I would've flown through the window and may not have survived.  But luckily, all I have is a shit ton of bruises and some chest pain (doctor said all is well).  

I have training today at noon (for a different job), about a half hour away.  It's all highway to get there.  And I'm freaking out.  I really don't want to drive but I know I have to.  I can't let this stop me.  My girlfriend dropped me off at work this morning and I had a small melt down in the car.  I was *just* getting comfortable driving and then this happened.

I know I'll have to just suck it up and drive.  I have no other choice.  But what can I do to minimize the anxiety while I'm driving?  To feel calmer and safer behind the wheel.  To prevent my head from seeing a potential car crash in any situation?

Luckily, this is a route I've taken before.  But the car accident was less than two minutes away, but it still happened.

Just in case: I'm not on any meds (aside from some pain killers for now) and I've never been diagnosed with anxiety problems of any kind.  This is pretty much the only thing that ever gives me any anxiety - everything else in life I tackle with a zeal.  But this is so debilitating! 

**TL;DR**: I've had driving anxiety for the 8 years I've had my license.  I was finally getting over it when I got into a bad car accident.  Anxiety is back with a vengeance.  Help!"

I have health insurance that covers what I would need to see someone about therapy or medication.

Pretty much completely based on focusing on negative stuff instead of positive. Like I had a friend over today to play video games, and she kept texting on her phone while playing. I later found out she was planning something with friends and she had to do it at that moment, but it still ""irked"" me to death about ""Is she having fun?"" ""Does she think I'm a cool person?"" ""What if I'm boring and shes texting out of boredom?"" etc etc etc

It's just stuff like that that keeps getting to me. I ""know"" everything is fine and nothing has really ""changed"" per say, but I keep getting negative thoughts like nobody likes me, nobody wants to put time for me, I get left out on purpose, etc etc etc. It's like a constant loop that I'm trying to get out of. Girl in above story actually gave me some meds that helped her in similar situations (which again, I should focus on that she cares about me enough to try to help me instead of dumb phone shit) but I havent noticed any difference really.

Anyways, I just feel stuck in a loop and have constant dread/fear. I've contemplated asking a few friends (including friend above) blatantly if they trust me/like me, but then I also feel like that's a bit too much/obvious and they'll think I'm crazy or something. "

I've had panic attacks all my life and I have been she people about it and taking meds. They have been working well but I still have panic attacks when I exercise. I think it is important to tell you what sort of caused me to have such a fear of exercise (I feel it is important to note that do to my fear I have not stopped eating healthy so you don't have to worry about my weight) When I was little I was told by my mom that me and my bigger sister had to do boxing. My other two bigger siblings did boxing so we had to as while. We boxed and everything was overall meh but I do remember feeling scared when we did laps. But then it happened. I don't remember how long I was in boxing at this point but I would have to guess a week or two. A new kid a lot younger then me joins our secession. I was fine with it until my trainer tells us to do sit ups. It's fine I'm good a sit ups. Typing this is hard for me i feel like i'm going to throw up. As I was doing sit ups I looked at the new kid he was already up and finished his sit ups. Then I looked a my sister she was up to and looking at me... I froze. I couldn't breath or move I was so scared. They waited for me but I broke down. I couldn't go on and I spent the rest of the session on the floor hyperventilating and crying. Then I hear the ringing of the door and my mom walks into the gym. Mom... I love her some much she means the world to me... and then she looked at me. She looked so angry. She started yelling she said that i'm embarrassed her. She hated me I cried the whole way back my sister didn't look a me once. The next sessions where just as bad. A few years later my mom tried to get me into boxing again and that time it was worse. Now I can't run without panicking and crying. I try so hard but no matter what I do I still fall down the same pit all those years ago. Now my brother wants me to do boxing again and I'm so scared. He doesn't know I have Panic Anxiety and I tried to explain to him why I breakdown sometimes but he doesn't get it. Please someone help

* - I have been under a lot of EXTRA stress this month. A very DOWN month in my recovery.  
* - I used to eat very healthy and do a lot of cardio, but since my sleep meds has lowered my blood pressure I can't do cardio without fainting D: and I have been eating very bad unhealthy stuff lately. + Gained weight.

I feel I am the same person, but, awake, alive, and unafraid. I still feel anxiety/fear, although it creeps up I feel it recognize it and it goes away. I find this change to be incredible, strange, and wonderful. I used to have panic attacks that made me miss work, cause horrible painful swelling in my joints and skin. I would get a temperature and experience the most awful mental distress where I felt I was coming apart. I would self harm and wail.

So a few months back after a bad storm that made life at work hell (cops involved, people becoming ill and injured, other crap) and the decision that I was going to be moving out. I had the panic attack of all panic attacks. I had been inside wailing (that uncontrollable cry you hear from a mourner) It is distressing for all involved to hear that sound so I went outside sat in a chair (to be away from others) and slumped forward and I have no idea what happened. For 2 hours I sat on the porch. I had the strangest experience (probably from lack of oxygen) where I saw warm and cold light. The feeling of becoming super small, but also a feeling of ""Oneness."" I came out of it when someone came out to check on me. When I went inside I felt very VERY strange but everything felt very real, I was ready to get ride of everything I ""owned"" I did two weeks later donate bags and bags of things to goodwill and threw away trash bag after trash bag of junk. But since then, I have not had a panic attack, instead when I feel one, the need to cry or my heart going nuts, or my skin swelling- I become calm- I feel warmth and that ""oneness"" again I feel loving- still fearful but with a sweet undertone.  I know this did not happen on its own, I did years of therapy, studying, and medications (I am no longer on.) This event, altered the way I see the world and respond to it, it stripped away a part of my built up reactions to stress. 

So, any idea of what the hell happened? I do not miss the extreme anxiety. I do not miss missing work or school and I do not miss the pain and stress. But what the heck happened? How? I feel like a person who is stable. Like this is what living was supposed to feel like the entire time,,, wtf?"

My wife has been suffering lately from anxiety attacks and some depression, and I want to help her, but I don't know where to start to be honest. I'm okay with her seeing a professional- it only makes sense, right? When the car is broken, you see a mechanic, when your teeth are bad, you see a dentist. When your thoughts hurt, you see a therapist.

Let me try to explain her (our) situation. If I miss anything or it isn't clear, please let me know where and how I can fix it. 

We are both young, early twenties. We've been married for a year, dated for five- the tail end of high school and all through college. We both graduated college one year ago. Like most high school kids, my wife and I both had self esteem issues in our teens, though I feel that she should be nothing but proud of her accomplishments- she graduated in the top three at our high school. In college, she graduated college suma cum laude from the honors program at the best university in the state. She has always had a little bit of anxiety, but over the last two years it's gotten much worse. It started towards the end of college. With graduation and our wedding around the corner, she started having crippling anxiety attacks. She would become very upset with hysterical crying and pains in her chest. The attacks almost always came accompanied with feelings that she was a ""bad person"" and she would recall embarrassing memories (sometimes from a long time ago, sometimes very mundane) that caused regret and remorse. This is the part that I find most frustrating, though my frustrations aren't directed at her- it's just frustrating because she's the most considerate and selfless person I know, and had never intentionally harmed another person or said anything malicious about anyone. A month before her graduation she began to take medications for the attacks- I don't remember which ones specifically, but there were two. One was a once daily and the other was for when the attacks got very bad. She was on the daily medication for about eight months, and closer to our wedding she got off it. She still has the other anxiety medication to take when the attacks get bad. 

Over the last few months since our wedding, her anxiety has gotten worse and it has come to take on an air of depression. She says things like she doesn't love herself. This part scares me very badly to the point where I feel like I'm going to be sick. She feels remorse and even shame over events that happened a long time ago. Sometimes it's over small interactions that most people would dismiss without thinking twice about, but she keeps revisiting them and reading into them over and over until she comes to the conclusion that she's a bad person. It's like she can't help but wander into these darker corners of her mind. I can sympathize, I'm familiar with this kind of sudden regretful memory or revisiting bad points, but I've grown able to quash those feelings by keeping my mind and hands occupied. So I understand where the feelings stem from, that's not the part I need help with. My attacks like this largely started going away after I started dating her. It gave me the self esteem to be able to deal with those thoughts. She on the other hand, hasn't been able to build up a defense mechanism. 

Anyways, she gets the attacks more often now. Anything I try to say or do to make her feel better doesn't work- she refuses to accept anything I say when I try to calm her down. She will, however, listen to her mother, who has had similar anxiety attacks. I guess the most frustrating part for me is that her mom will tell her the exact same thing I will and it will calm her down. I say it frustrates me because I'm her husband for crying out loud, I should be able to comfort her. I should be able to  fix her problems, she's my wife.

Here is the external situation- our home life is good. We're not awesome money wise, but we are comfortable. She is very close to her mom (we both are, actually), and we have an apartment in the next town over from her parents. The work situation is not as good. In a month we will be moving a few states away for my job. Since graduating college, she has been working a job where she is underemployed for her credentials. She loved the job when she got it 10 months ago, but has gradually learned to dislike it because it involves some physical labor aspects to it, which she struggles with because she physically small in size- just over 5'2 and under 100 pounds. I think this inability to perform some of her job's tasks has taken a toll on her as well, since her self esteem thus far has been built on her successes. She was very (VERY) successful academically, but now that school is over she is struggling even more with her self esteem issues.

Now that I've given you a back story, here is what I need help with-
*I don't know where to begin to look for help. This is something a therapist can help, right? Or is it a psychologist? Is there a difference between the two? There's so much I don't know, and I don't know where to start.
*After I find out what kind of professional help she needs, I need to locate one. Is there a way I can find out if the therapist is a good one? I need to know because she's too important to me for this to be handled improperly.
*Once I find a professional, I need to be able to affectively communicate with them the problem. Where can I find a list of anxiety disorders (is that the right word, disorders?) and look for the one she might suffer from? Do any of you know what it might be called?
*When she is having these attacks, what can I do to mollify them or help her?

I need help with these things. I also need *guidance*. If anybody knows of *anything* that might help, please, I'm listening and willing to do it.

At first I felt really hopeful, and I had things to occupy my time (concert, commencement, then resting after all of that for a day), but now that everyone has gone home and I'm (physically) alone for a majority of the day, I find my anxiety creeping back up on me.

My doctor told me that a side-effect of the medication is anxiety, and I expressed myself probably a little too hostile-- ""NO, I don't need MORE anxiety, THAT makes me feel anxious, just thinking about it!"", and I'm just being dumb and feel like the anxiety I'm feeling now is just karma kicking me in the butt. Argh. 

But, it's only been a week. This is the first time I've ever been on any kind of medication, and I suppose it's a bit worrisome. I could ask ""how long do these side effects last"" and all that stuff, but I'm pretty sure they vary from person to person. I just hate it when my anxiety takes over me.

Today I woke up and called my boyfriend. He was feeling sick last night when he left my house, and I wanted to check up on him to see if he was okay. He said he was still sick, but I felt like he didn't want to talk for whatever reason, and I started thinking about how it's probably my fault and I did something he didn't like last night, and blah blah blah... we usually don't have problems like that. It's usually me just ""overreacting"" because I fear that I am always a burden to people. It's been rough, but I'm working on it. He's understanding, and he does know that sometimes my anxiety gets to me, and he does help. I suppose this morning I wanted to work on this by myself without any help from him (or anyone else, for that matter) because my mom made me feel slightly more anxious about the situation. 

I have been writing my feelings down lately in a journal and online, and it has been a nice way to get my feelings out without feeling like a burden on anyone. Feeling like a burden needs to stop. My friends and family love me, and I need to realize that they are not lying to me when they tell me I'm not a burden.

I waited over a month and during that time I often felt like on drugs, flying etc... I thought I'm going nuts. Before that event I feared more or less nothing. Nowadays I fear more or less everything where I'm not in situation where I can leave. I don't have social anxiety (e.g. I host poeple from CS), I speak daily with people and occasionally do some lectures, but mostly in front of people I know. I don't fear people, airplanes, dogs, elevators, ... When I were flying the past years, I was always anxious for 20 or more hours. Unable to eat anything, unable to sleep. A sick feeling like I've to vomit all the time. I've to pee all the time and quite often get diarrhea (this can happen within minutes). This happens in this situations where I feel like I've no control.

I was going to a doctor and got some meds. Most of them didn't help or had the opposite effect (e.g. Surmontil, I was longer awake then normally). I also got Sertralin, which was the worst thing I ever took, after taking it, I liked to kill myself. Some months ago I went to a psychologist. Told everything. But I always got the feeling that she tried to think about my past, about my childhood, some Freudian stuff etc... wasn't everything perfect there, like in most families, but nothing really shamefull happened, not worth to spend too much time. I recently quit my job and liked to travel around, but some days before I liked to go, in a night I had some kind of an attack, could not eat anymore, my brain was just generating random noise, got very weak as a consequence. I once more tried Sertralin but I made everything even worse (same shitty thoughts). It's not that I fear that I die and then try to avoid things, the real thing is that my body completely overreacts and I'm mere zombie then anything else.

Googling for the possible solutions for my problem I discovered meditation. Foundation of my therapy was samatha and vipassana meditation + cognitive behavioral therapy rather than taking meds. With time and persistence my anxiety started to fall off till it reach the level of present anxiety - a manageable anxiety with which I can normally socialize, make new friendships and function on the day to day basis which I couldn't do before. Also, meditation brought a better understanding of the world, the concept which we call ""self"" and other things we discover on our path. But, last few weeks I discovered that my treatment is stagnating. Ok, no worries, I'll just increase the dose of my meditation and everything should be fine. I started to meditate 3 times a day for a 30-40min period per session. And then I realized something. Every time my anxiety became scarier and harder to cope with I saw as a sign that my meditation effects are wearing off and I should sit and meditate to bring myself to the feel good mood back again. Well, I was wrong. I started using meditation as an escape pod from my anxiety feelings rather than a tool to understand them. Every time I've got anxious instead I comfort my anxiety and work with it with other techniques like CBT I was running away from it. Don't get me wrong, meditation is a great tool, the best thing I discovered in my life, but our brain especially the anxious brain has it ways to make really benign stuff into harmful attachments and defense mechanisms. I'm really happy I've discovered this. Today I only sit twice a day, in the morning and in the afternoon, and when I get anxious I just let it be and work with it instead of avoiding it. I hope this was helpful for somebody :)"

I guess this year I thought my anxiety would never rear it's head again. Met an amazing girl, made new friends, went on some trips - made the mistake of going off my medicine. Bad move, sadly - my anxiety is back hard, triggered I would guess by my father's continuing (but successful) battle with cancer.

An amazing job opportunity literally fell into my lap earlier this week. I went, interviewed, and scored the job - but immediately after accepting the offer, was up all hours of the night with a very nasty panic attack. Worrying about where I am in life, if I'm making the right choices, worrying about giving my two weeks notice at my current job...

I felt almost like I wasn't myself. Like, my personal identity was wavering. I'm sure many of you know this feeling. It's unpleasant. Thankfully, I gave my two weeks notice and I'm slowly starting to recover form last night... but I want to have a good life and I want to enjoy what I have and be happy.

It's frustrating that even positive life changes have the potential to freeze me up. I'm starting my SSRI over again, I find no shame or feeling of defeat in that. I just want to feel better again soon. Knowing that others feel like this too bums me out.  I am confident and hopeful that returning to my medication and potentially going back to therapy will help me get back into recovery.

Tl;dr - life changes overwhelm me, whether they be good or bad. "

So I am a 26 M living in South Korea and have been dealing with some issues related to health anxiety. Recently, I have been having the urge to pee constantly. Like, it won't go away unless I am running or I am out with friends. I have been going back from hospital to hospital getting test done. The international clinics are quiet far, so I have been going to the Korean hospitals around the corner where they speak little English, but enough. I have had 2 urine test, 2 ultra sounds of my bladder, kidney x-ray, and a blood test. All came back normal. Well a few weeks ago,  the doctor decided to check my prostate, but instead of stick his fingers up my ass, he decided to stick a giant stick up there to take pictures of my prostate and bladder (Was not a pleasant experience) Well all came back normal and he said I have an overactive bladder and gave me this medicine to take for 2 months. (No idea what it is, but I would like to trust him). Well it is 3 weeks in and still don't feel any different and wondering if the doctor could have missed something or if it is my anxiety acting up?!?!

Some history to help, I have lived in Korea for 2 years before, lived in OZ for a year, and just moved back to Korea. I startex to get heath anxiety in OZ a year ago when I kept getting headaches and thought I had a brain tumor. Got an MRI, all was good felt better. Then, before I left for NZ for a month, started having chest problems, got and ekg and all that was good, felt better a month later. Maybe 6 months ago, thought I had colon cancer cause I was pooping weird, got test all was good, felt better later. So it would seem anxiety is ruling my life, but I don't know if this is just another case or if it really could be serious. I really do feel like I have to pee all the time. Either in my stomach/bladder or at the tip of my penis. I read somewhere that anxiety could cause all this. It has been almost a month now and don't know what to do!?!

Cheers for all the advice/help.
Sorry for spelling and grammar, doing this on my phone real quick.

The stress of it, on the other hand, resulted in me spending 20 minutes crying. The crying resulted in a pounding headache that I've had for 8+ hours now. I took an oxycodone to help ease it and am waiting for it to kick in fully, but I know it may not help the headache itself since different pain medication types work on different kinds of pain. I took it more in the hopes that it will relax me enough to lower my blood pressure. I probably should've taken a xanax instead, but I'm down to 2 left and I've been too anxious and tired to make another doctor appointment to get a new script.

I don't have a history of blood pressure issues besides stress headaches every now and then. I'm pretty much writing this in the hopes that putting it down in words will help me calm down enough to sleep it off. Mostly, though, I wanna throw up, cry more, and stick my head in the refrigerator in the hopes that the cold will stop the pain.

One thing I really want to know, though, is whether or not this is a migraine? I've never been diagnosed with migraines before, but I've been told by family and friends that migraine pain is excruciating. I don't like being overzealous with saying I ""have a migraine"", but this stress headache has lasted more than 8 hours, light seems to make it hurt worse, but lack of light doesn't do much to help. I want to throw up, and I can actually feel my pulse in my head. "

I was able to clip them for the first time ever last night. Anxiety that once ran my life, and thoughts that once clouded my judgement and vision, have ceased to control my decisions, beliefs, and actions. To all of you brave souls out there who struggle day by day, I make this post to tell you that anxiety can be conquered. The struggle isn't easy; there were countless times when I felt unable to fight back. But each day it became easier and easier, where finally my intrusive thoughts are nothing but insignificant blips of random, fleeting images.

My struggle is my own, and anxiety is a many-faced monster that differs from person to person. But through the years I have found that there are so many ways to fight it. Therapy and medication are not to be overlooked, despite the unfair stigma that may surround them. Friends and family can help as well, but in the end we are the ones who know our own personal little shit monsters called anxiety the best. It is a fight, and it will be difficult at times, but it is this hardship that makes us stronger and stronger.

So some back story: my dad has been on Paroxetine for about ten years now. Mostly due to anxiety I think, although he doesn't really confide in me or my mother. He isn't a very talkative guy. This past month he's been going to a psychologist and a psychiatrist because he decided that he wants to stop using medication (the Parotexine, which he has been using without any supervision from either a psychologist or a psychiatrist for about eight years now, I think).

They recommended him to u gradually stop using parotexine, which he did. Now he's on escitalopram, which is supposedly easier to stop with once you're used to it. He's having a hard time, I think he's going cold turkey still from the parotexine. He literally can't stand still, he took a break from his work about a week ago. He is either outside, walking, or at home trying to sleep. He can't eat, he can't drink water (he even stopped smoking) and he tells us that it feels like his head is on fire, he's agitated and very on edge.

I figured, there would be people here who both have personal experience going through (maybe something similar) as him, but also people who have known someone who had to go through this. Can anyone give me any advice on how I could support him? How do you show your support, what could you best tell someone in this situation?

But essays, exams, etc (especially essays are the worst! and my major is quite writing intensive) I end up staring at and never starting. I often end up never starting my essays and never turning them in, which has taken a huge toll on my gpa. Sometimes I don't turn in final/term papers that are near 20 pages and about half of my grade. 

I stay up all night every night and often stay up 3 or 4 days in a row staring at my work and panicking. I'm really not a lazy person, I spend a significant amount of time ""doing"" my essays and ""studying"" for exams but really I just stare and panic.

I have a therapist and she's understanding (plenty of other therapists I've had haven't been but this one is), but I still don't find therapy helpful and never have. I am on medication, so I no longer actively have outward panic attacks...but my fear inside is just as strong. It's like a passive panic attacking...I'm internally panicking but I can't ""chemically"" feel panic, which is just as bad as full blown panicking.

I got to work and about an hour into it I started feeling very lightheaded. It wouldn't go away. So I went into the bathroom, sat on the toilet, and attempted to relieve myself. While doing that I remembered what my dad told me, most people, when they die from a heart attack, it usually happens when they are on the toilet. Suddenly my left hand felt pressure, lightheaded began again. I  finished up and left. I went outside for some fresh air and change of scenery, it somewhat took the edge off but not completely. I returned to my desk, I found it was very hard for me to type, to consantrait on what I was doing. I kept freaking out that I was having a stroke or something was teribly wrong with me. ( I have had anxiety for about 5 years now, I have been on Zoloft and Paxil, I didn't like the way they made me feel so I stopped taking them) Anyways, I left my desk after sometime and found a little area that was quiet, I sat, contimplating another hospital trip.. I was scared, I am scared. I have been experiencing strange symptoms that are different than my normal anxiety, tremors from inside my body, tingling in my left hand. I have had many tests done on my cardio and ct scans, nothing comes up, everything checks out. I left work and called my father, I hate calling him becasue he is 64 years old, on his way to retirement, cancer survivor and I don't want to burden him with my issues.

As a 32 year old man I feel ashamed of my condition. I went on vacation last week, only to have an attack there as well, hindering my supposed to be relaxation. 

I think what fuels this so much is my fear. My fear of death. Dying before my parents do. 

I am so upset right now, I feel like I have no one to turn to, no where to go. I have scheduled a Dr appt with a new Dr on monday. I plan on unloading this pile of worry onto him in hopes that I can get some sort of guidance. I know I need to speak to a therpist now. Or psychiatrist. Im not against taking medicine again, but im not exactly looking forward to it.

But, she spends most of her days either sleeping or watching TV. She does go to college but as of this year she switched to a community college and lives at home. I know that she suffers from anxiety because of the conversations I've had with her but at this point I don't know what I can do to help.

Then she can't push the negative thoughts away. 

She is on medication, something along the lines of Prozac, and seeing therapy but I don't think she is completely honest with the therapist. She isn't honest with her family either and some days she can get very nasty and breakdown in tears. I recognize that if she was honest with us that the situation would be easier to comprehend and make better. But in my opinion she probably isn't very honest with her self either.

Doctor S prescribed me Ativan and a sleeping medication and sent me on my way, but he made me feel a little uncomfortable and I wanted to try someone new. 

A new urgent care opened down the street that also does primary care, so I went to talk to doctor M there and she was much better. She put me on prozac and it seemed to stabilize me and I got my shit in order. I tried to quit taking prozac because of the sexual side effects, and I thought I didn't need it anymore. Fast forward 6 months and my life has taken a bad turn, and the anxiety and panic attacks are back in full force. 

I try going to doctor M but she is on maternity leave, and the staff there laugh at me from behind the door (thought it was my anxiety at first, but no it *was* about me) because I never actually made her my primary care. Go back to doc S, he tries diagnosing me with ADD which could be true, but the anxiety is more important to me. 

Doc S has given me three different prescriptions that do not work well with me now. I am moving out of state soon, I don't have the time to be trying new medicines like this. It's driving me up a wall. Last time I told him to please just let me start taking the prozac again, side effects were minimal compared to these new meds and it works.

If anything at all goes wrong, it can and will ruin my mood at the moment, for the day, or even for the week. If a video-game session doesn't go exactly like I wanted, if the pizza I ordered isn't made the way I had hoped, if I want to play with my cat and she bites me because she wants to be left alone... things like these (mostly, but not always) make me want to crawl in a hole and cry, as if something tragic had happened.

Living life for me is like tip-toeing around a field of landmines everywhere I go, which makes me want to do the only thing I know won't set off my anxiety-- lay in bed, in the dark, and do absolutely nothing.

This, by the way, is with the help of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication. Which seem like it will turn into a pipe dream soon, since I have no health insurance and can't afford any since I'm unemployed.

I had an anxiety attack so bad the other day and there were literally no triggers, no thoughts, I relaxed and breathed through it and it continued to rack my body. All I could do was sit in a ball and sob. Self injurous urges coursed through my body but I held on to some semblance of sanity and hugged myself and meditatied through it. Waves of anger and sorrow crashed over me. I was the buddha holding on to peace and calm while my body suffered, but I could not stop the emotional torrent. I was scared and desprate and then by best friend called to tell me about a podcast she had been listening to with a veteran who was experienceing the same thing to the word as what I had been describing to her. He had a hormone imbalance and once he was diagnosed and treated appropriately he was back to ""normal"" within 6 weeks.
I kept telling everyone I saw for my anxiety that it was hormonally related, in that it was always worse with PMS so why oh why has nobody done a hormone balance panel on me? No clue, but I'm demanding one now.
Same day: I have a neighbor, who is also a veteran and she said that Prosac wasn't helping, but going off of it sent her into a psychosis that nearly got her admitted. She was insistant that it wasnt' the answer and a friend of hers recommended high dose Niacin. She passed this on to me and during that awful anxiety attack I took one and it stoped. Just stopped. I was still sad, tender, and edgy but I could breathe, I could move, and I could start to think a little. Within 4 hours it dropped me like a hot potato and I was right back in it again, so I took another and the same thing: the anxiety turned off.
Now I don't like psych meds and I don't like homone replacement therapy, so I started doing some research on my own. B-vitamin complex, especially B-6 (not niacin) helps correct estrogen imbalance. I'm going to stay on the Niacin because it's helping. I'm going to get a Female Hormone Panel done (there's a male one too). I'm staying on Passionflower as a mood stabilizer and sedative for now. I'm taking Milkthisle for liver support and to help metabolize estrogen. I'm avoiding soy like the plague. I'm still going to therapy. I hope this information helps someone else as well."

This was probably around middle of October. I thought I had finally got to grips with this and found myself feeling a lot better. But within the past few weeks, I'm slipping back into these episodes again. I've had to miss a few workshops at Uni and it's affecting me completing my work. There's nothing on my mind that's bothering me. Apart from these episodes I'm a very happy person. I'm confused as to why I'm still feeling like this and why is it still so intense even when on meds. I've tried counselling before and it didn't help, I'm not too keen on this idea as I don't see how they would be able to help as I wouldn't be able to explain what I'm feeling anxious about??
I'm booking another appt. at the doctors tomorrow. But I'm worried as to what they're going to suggest. 
Has anyone else been in this situation? 
Do you suggest asking to change my meds, or have I just not stuck with the citalopram long enough??
I'm hesitant about changing meds and it would feel like I'm starting all over again. I feel quite alone with this, so any advice would be brillant!

Thank you xox"

I wouldn't want to go anywhere because I was afraid I would ""get sick"". Whenever I slept over at a friends house I always ended up calling my parents in the middle of the night to come pick me up.

In high school I was finally diagnosed with anxiety, panic attacks and depression. It used to go through waves, being really bad (not being able to leave the house) to being manageable. It also seemed to sort of just go away on its own.

I'm now on the tail end of one of my really bad episodes. Or at least I hope it's the end. I'm better than I was a year ago. The thing that drives me crazy is my panic attacks and anxiety come out of no where. Therapist try and tell me there *has* to be a trigger, even if its subconscious, but there's not. They are random and annoying.

I just don't know how to fix myself if I don't know why I'm broken. I'm on meds, I've tried a million different types, I've been through countless hours of therapy and was even inpatient once in the hospital for behavioral health. Nothing seems to make a dent. It just does whatever it wants to when it wants to.

Sorry for rambling, I just needed to vent. Maybe somebody else feels the same way? There are days I just feel like giving up. "

So, I took a huge step today and made my first counseling appointment. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) when I was little. I can't remember how long ago it was, but I'm guessing around age 10 or 11. A psychiatrist started me on Paxil and eventually switched to fluoextine, which is what I have been taking daily for the past several years. However, I've never really been to any kind of individual or group cognitive therapy. I'm a student of psychology at university and, particularly lately, studies have shown that cognitive therapy can be equally, if not more, effective as medication. I am so tired of being racked with worries and constant fears. I don't have panic disorder, but I do tend to have fairly frequent panic attacks, especially if I am stressed or sleep deprived. My anxiety is beginning to affect my relationship with my boyfriend (who is wonderfully patient and the best thing that has ever happened to me!) and my faith (the most important thing to me), and I decided to take this struggle into my own hands. Because I've been diagnosed with GAD for so long and have researched it so thoroughly, I'm not too nervous about starting counseling. However, I'd love to hear about y'all's counseling experiences! Good? Bad? Ugly? What should I expect? 

Wish me luck!"

Since then I have been experiencing new symptoms all the time it seems, while at the same time having tangible ailments to (getting sinus surgery in a few weeks and have a compressed ulnar nerve in one arm for sure) so it has become harder to tell what is a symptom of anxiety and what isn't. I've also tried 3 daily anxiety meds to no success as my body absolutely does not react well to changed in the serotonin levels.

So question 1) I have getting numbness and some tingling in my feet, ankles, and just today started to feel like a humming in the thigh of my right leg - like when your phone is vibration in your pocket - very soft and subtle and last for maybe 4-5 seconds and starts and stops again. It seems to happen when I'm sitting up and not so much when I'm laying down. To be clear, there is no spasms that occur, no perceptive movements, just the sensation. Are these things anyone else has experience with or has had happen to them before?

2) For the meds - has anyone found good daily medicine to control anxiety outside of the serotonin inhibitor family? Has anyone else had the same type of bad reaction as I have to the whole group? While my Doc goes back to the drawing boarding I have been left to sparingly use Xanax for the needed occasions. I react great to Xanax and only use half of a .25mg tablet when needed. My doctor however does not like Xanax and already wants to switch me off even though I still have half the pills left in the 30 pill bottle I was given back in January. Is my doctor being overly cautious or is Xanax really that bad to be taking?

I saw a therapist but only one visit because I am shy. The first visit lasted 15 of the planned 60 minutes and ended with her suggesting maybe I wasn't ready to talk. I guess she had a point though, because I still don't know what it was I should talk about. I'm sort of selfish for being a sad sack about this and honestly, I'm a little embarrassed about that I'm so selfish and incapable of dealing with things like everyone else.

My GP put me on an SSRI when I told him everything, but I still usually feel generally bad most of the time. What's the worst though, are episodes where I'm more or less ""triggered"" to think about the relationship and can't stop dwelling on it or I see the ex (today). It just builds up and builds up and I end up cutting myself sometimes, or just sitting bawling like a baby in my room (quite embarrassing to admit) wishing I would just cease to exist. It feels genuinely horrifying. I have discussed this with my GP, but he just doubled my prozac. I have not noticed an improvement.

I am wondering if anxiety medication could be useful for when I have these episodes. They are absolutely terrifying. I'm not sure, however, if they are really ""anxiety attacks"" or if they're just times when I feel like shit. I sort of want to ask my GP, but I'm afraid of two things: 

1. I almost get the feeling he already thinks I am giant pussy for not being able to deal with the end of my relationship (I am male) and 

2. I am afraid of coming off as some dude that just wants to get high on benzo's or something. Technically, if I asked him ""I think I have anxiety attacks and I think anti-anxiety meds would help"" that is drug-seeking. But all I want is some source of help or something I can do to help myself during these times because they are pretty much a living nightmare.

Any sort of help or advice is much appreciated. The more practical, the better. This has been going on for 6 months and I really want to stop being like this...  Thank you."

She is on a lot of medication and not eaten will obviously make her feel like that. She was sent home after two hours and just told to eat. 

This is when it starts to get bad for me. We meet for much usually once a week. This Friday I asked if we could do it another time since I had some running around to do. I could have made it but honestly didn't think much of it since she doesn't mind- we are always flexible. If only I had met her for lunch she would have eaten and felt better. 

A few minutes ago I searched ""grandmother refusing to eat"" and found articles and forums. People are saying that it's the beginning of the end and terrible things like that. I can't stop crying.

Her health isn't too great but she still drives and works the weekends at a job she just has to sit there and do simple tasks. It's more for socializing but she gets paid. She has been upset over things happening in the family recently (her daughters failing marriage) and has always been one to skip meals but I'm not ready for this. I shouldn't have googled that.

I feel stressed out all the time, I'm terrified to apply for better jobs, I have a terrible time making friends and just talking to people. I worry about what other people think of me to the point that I've had panic attacks from the fear that I offended someone. My mind replays conversations from years ago and I can't stop second guessing myself, and I feel so stupid for things I say, even if it's just smalltalk, like ""Hi how are you?"" smalltalk.

My fiance has been encouraging me to talk to a counselor. I made an appointment and had one session a few weeks ago, but I didn't really hit it off with the doctor I talked to. I felt silly talking about myself and I felt like she thought I was stupid, but I don't know, maybe that's just the anxiety still. Basically I talked for an hour about crap going on in life and where I think my anxiety is coming from. But even talking to a counselor I can't turn off that obsessive self-evaluation of everything I'm saying, how I sound, how the other person is perceiving me and probably judging me, and to be honest I felt worse after I went because I was worried about what I said for the next few days.  

I don't want to give up, but I don't really want to go back. I guess part of the problem is that I just don't know what I want out of counseling. Right now it seems like I'm just going to talk about my anxiety and then have anxiety about talking about my anxiety. I don't know what would be a reasonable outcome to expect and how long it would take to get there.

So, all of that to say - I was hoping some of you might tell me about your experiences with counseling for anxiety, if you've had it. What's your story? How do you get over social anxiety long enough to talk to someone about it? Did you try counseling + medication? What kinds of things do you talk about in counseling? What has helped you? What is reasonable for me to expect from a counselor? Those sorts of things."

When I was in 4th grade, I counted how many pieces of bread I ate to make sure I didn't get diabetes. In the 5th grade, I thought I had breast cancer. I have grown up with it and accepted that I am a huge worrier. But as I'm starting to reach adulthood and trying to get my life together, I cannot deal with these anxieties anymore. All of these ""what if"" scenarios. I'll give you a few that has just happened this week: 

Having a fear of contracting HIV even though I have never had sex or shared needles. But 2 years ago I accidentally got someone's blood in my mouth. 

Boyfriend had to go into the hospital for a fever and a headache. Went into a full blown anxiety breakdown thinking I gave him HIV. We've never had sex or exchanged bodily fluids in any way. 

Boyfriend ended up with contraction salmonella. We own lizards and he probably got it from them. But I was confused for a moment thinking that when they went to the vet they were given antibiotics (which doesn't get rid of it anyway) and he had to have gotten it from my friend's turtle. Told a doctor this, and they said they might have to do a home visit and look at my animals. Anxiety break down because they might think that I lied to them about the salmonella and I will have charges pressed against me. 

Went to an amusement park over the weekend. Every single ride I had to have myself triple checked that my seat was intact and I was locked in. And even after the ride started, I was pulling and tugging at the locks making sure I was in. Had a breakdown while on the ride. 

Was cooking salmon. I couldn't be 100% that it was cooked even though it was flakey and temped to at least 165. Didn't eat any of it, just threw it out. 

Had stomach pains, thought I had tapeworms because I ate shrimp (cooked perfectly). 

And I cannot get myself to calm down no matter what. These anxieties will last for hours and hours and I'll hyperventilate. And when people yell at me to calm down, it makes it worse. I can't do it. I have to get some kind of medicine or see some kind of therapist because my life is being controlled by this. I need help.  "

I went and visited a naturopath this weekend to check my vitamin/mineral levels,  as well as other alternative methods of improving my health,  rather than simply increasing my psychotropics (AGAIN).  Found out in my first visit that three meds I am currently on (two psychotropics,  and one to treat my migraines) all leach away Vit B's.

I am on medication for depression and have emergency medication for panic attacks/severe mood swings. So far the mood swings are definitely getting better but not yet nonexistent. As for the anxiety: I am afraid to go out of the house, but it's only overwhelming when I have to take public transport. The big ""what if something happens"" is always the center of my thoughts, even the night before. I usually end up talking myself out of going. I had to quit my first job because I cried in bed every morning, but in this case I wasn't exactly anxious. I loved my job. But for some reason, even the thought of going stressed me out so much that I couldn't take it anymore. High school was even worse; I managed to get my diploma by the skin of my teeth. 

I am in my third round of anxiety therapy, which hasn't seemed to work well in the past. I try to utilize the skills they teach, but somehow the anxiety still takes me over. Anxiety medication is the last resort (again), and I'm kind of hoping they end up putting me on some type of mild sedative, so I can at least do some type of work. I would love to continue doing what I was doing in my old job. 

I just have a few questions and I'm really hoping you could answer them for me. 

I feel like I'm being misunderstood in therapy and in my sessions with my pill doctor (not sure what her title is?). How can I explain myself better to make sure I'm getting my point across correctly?

Does anyone else get these mood swings like I do? They only happen at night, and it comes on as only a slight sadness or anger but then it escalates and I feel restless/incredibly moody.

Lastly, what can I do about dreading to go to work? Eventually I want to go back to my job and start college, but I know I am going to feel the same way all over again. My family thinks I am lazy and they constantly nag about me getting a job. It's not that I don't want to. It's because I can't.

I was on 75 mg for over a year and it was working well enough for my anxiety and depression, but I was gaining weight, lost my libido, my tics and compulsions were worsening a bit, and I started to have really crazy reactions to alcohol (extreme blackouts and confrontational). I was beginning to feel like I'd gone in a kind of remission to my anxiety/panic attacks and depression, so I wanted to see how I'd do off medication.

The first two weeks were fine. I went down to 50 mg, was supposed to go to 25 but was a little apprehensive so I prolonged the 50 for an extra week. And now there's NO way I'm going to 25 or off it altogether! I've quickly realized I wasn't any better, the medication just suppressed it... 

I've been waking up every day at 2 pm and even then it's almost impossible to get out of bed. When I do I'm shaky and sad with no explanation. During the afternoons/evenings I feel better but I'm usually distracted by my fast-paced waitressing job. The minute I get home I'm back to being anxious and full of misplaced hopelessness. My chest aches and my heart races like crazy, I get light headed and restless, and I'm a bit paranoid and jumpy. 

I feel the onset of a panic attack coming on and I'm just sitting here unsure what to do, wanting to fucking break down. I feel like my future has no hope for it and I'll just become more and more insane. I know these thoughts are anxiety-induced but I can't stop it. I know I obviously have to go back up to the 75 mg but I just feel so damn defeated and exhausted. 

I haven't felt so mentally ill since a year and a half ago, when I checked myself into the hospital for nonstop panic attacks.

please give me encouraging words. I need to know that if I'm going to be on medication forever, there's one out there that doesn't cause SO many long term side effects."

Where do i start...

I am not sure why i am writing this, i just need to get it out.
I am 27 years old and live in Northern Ireland. I live with my parents. My mum is bedbound with MS and requires consistant care. 

Previous to last week this was provided by me and my dad. My dad is an alcoholic, after two years of sobriety he relapsed last christmas.

On saturday he stopped drinking and suffered a withdrawal seizure on saturday night. He was kept in hospital but got increasingly agitated and confused.
He is not the same, more irritable, his personality isn't him. He is mixing up what day it is, doesn't understand that he isn't well and also his mobility, which was already bad, is worse.

The doctor wanted to do a CT scan to check on the confusion, but said it was likely due to the withdrawal due to its sudden onset. 
My dad was throwing tantrums to get home and i got a phone call to say they couldn't keep him in as he refused treatment.
The doctors couldn't keep him in and even declared him fit to sign himself out tonight(!). My brother who lives nearby has been helping the past few days, but he has his own family, work and other things
which means i am the one here 24/7. 

Just now my dad went downstairs, dressed in his pajama shirt and trousers, looking to go to the post office as he thought it was 10am rather than 10pm.
Given his confused state and the fact it is still bright outside, i am hoping this was just a small mistake.
I am hoping and wishing so much that the confusion passes and that it is just a phase of the withdrawal.
I am calling my mothers social worker tomorrow to organise daily care for her, a social worker for my dad is supposed to call me tomorrow morning
and i will also call his own doctor to see if there is some type of monitoring that can be done, or medication to settle him.

I am on the edge, panicking, anxious, nervous and worried. I can barely handle taking care of my mum on her own, now to add a mentally confused alcoholic also...

I don't know what to do, i am on my own here, i haven't slept properly in four days and have barely eaten. When i ask for help no-one knows what to do, or cannot offer help.

I am thinking of just leaving and letting the social services do what they have to. At this point my patience for my dad is wearing thin, i am just concerned about my mum. Her mental
state is not really there at all and she is unaware of any of this. 

I had to leave my job a few months ago because of his crap and to make sure my mum was being looked after right, i feel stuck, trapped and like there is nothing i can do to get out of this."

(Early 20s, living with fiance, diagnosed with bipolar, GAD and panic disorder. Taking lamictal daily and xanax as needed)


I got a new job a little over a month ago. A true dream job for me, everything I wanted. Everything went great at first, but each mistake I made just snowballed. I messed up a project, and even though the manager just corrected me, it still hung over me some. This kept repeating. My anxiety started to impact my work. My coworker, friends and family all kept telling me that mistakes are normal when you're new. That I shouldn't worry. 

Last week, my boss called me into her office for a performance evaluation. She struggled to come up with things I was doing well. She said that I was doing ""terrible in regards to both speed and accuracy."" That I'd ""been going two steps back for every one forward."" Direct quotes. Then she cut my hours by 25%.

Before this, none of my managers had mentioned a problem. Individual errors had been pointed out with increasing frequency, but I was always told ""it's okay, just do it like this next time."" I feel blindsided. I mean, I kept thinking ""omg, I'm terrible, I can't do my job, I'm awful, they're going to fire"" but I pushed those thoughts out of my mind. Well, those thoughts were right.

 I can't get by working just these new hours. I'm going to need a new job. It's like I was fired, except they expect me to keep coming in. If I just quit, I'll have to borrow money to make it through the next month.

TODAY

I went in to work today after a lot of handholding and encouragement from my fiance. Normally, I dread work up until I get there, and then calm down once I actually get going. So I just kept telling myself that all I had to do was get there, and I'd be ok. I had taken a xanax right when I woke up, which is normally enough to keep my calm for quite a while even at my most anxious. I was still shaking though, and none of my ""tools"" were working. (Mantras, deep breathing, acknowledging each worry then letting it go, etc. I've got a whole pile of tools like these stashed away that normally help substantially.)

I get to work, and it just keeps getting worse. It doesn't ease up as I start doing tasks. At all. I slip away to the bathroom and take another xanax. I keep waiting for it to kick in, to take the edge off, anything. (I can't even remember the last time I took two in one day. One has always been enough. Always slowed me down enough to use my ""tools."") I only notice it ""kicked in"" when I become a complete klutz. Very dangerous at my job. It was that almost drunken feeling like I got the first time I took xanax, before I got used to it.  But I didn't feel calmer. I just felt more panicked. I was fucking up even more than usual and nothing was helping. I hadn't had a panic attack in over a year until today. I went back into the bathroom, stayed there for a while, told my manager I was sick and had to go home, she told me to call tonight and let her know if I'll be coming in tomorrow. As I'm getting my things, I can hear her talking to my boss. My boss saying how she doubts I'll be back. My manager laughing. I rush out and go home, trying to keep myself together on the train. 

WHERE I NEED HELP

I don't know how to go back into work tomorrow. I just don't. I feel just as helpless as I did when I had my first panic attack. I'm seeing my psychiatrist Monday. I know, and genuinely believe, that things will be okay in the long run. I have job interview on the 7th. The job it's for is only ""meh,"" but I know I can get it if I want to and I'd be less demanding. So what do I do tomorrow? I feel like I can't go in. How am I supposed to tough this one out? Do I call in sick? Do I just stop showing up? Do I call and quit without notice? My normal answer would just be to ""work through it"" and go in anyway. But I really don't think I can. My tools, my medication, my stubborn attitude aren't enough this time. It scares me. I'm nearly freaking out now just trying to figure out my plan. Please help. "

The idea is to make my therapy more effective and make it easier for myself to move forward in life at a faster pace. I do not want benzos because I need to remain sharp and focused. I expressed concern about the possible side effects, primarily libido. He recommended Prestig, as it is known to have fewer side effects. It is however more expensive. He then suggested that I can try Ciprolex, which he said about 40% of his patients suffer from decreased libido, but is also a good medication and much cheaper. In the end, I can afford both, just want to get a feel of which is more successful and any input from people who have tried either one. Thanks."

I've never taken my anxiety seriously, even though I know it has been there. 

It started in high school and comes with some time in between but this time it has grown worse.

Somehow it just felt so certain that I could not and would not survive if I stayed in the classroom. That's the best way that I can express it. It's not a 'fear of death' per se but just the feeling that 'if I stay here I won't survive'.

For very long I just tolerated this but now it has come to a point where it is invalidating me and I'm unsure of what to do.

I have contacted a psychologist with anxiety/fear as his specialty. I spoke with my doctor about medication but I felt as if I would try to seek advice and counselling first."

It was only a passing moment because she seemed more concerned with getting me through a really hard transition of colleges. It was a very helpful experience but it ultimately didn't work out too well. Because of this I'm afraid of going back to her because I initially went to wonder why I had been having so much trouble connecting with people. The problems is really getting out of hand. I'm a mid-twenties male. Only recently finished taking classes at a community college and never had a job. Constantly feeling hopeless, lost, and confused with just about everything involved with my life. I have enough friends and family I could count on one hand. Even so, I keep then only at arm's length. I can't go out and make friends because I'm horrible at conversation. Trying to find a job has been the worst feeling in the world. After reading some more into social anxiety, it feels likes so right to me. I sometimes get breathing problems, my mind will often become so overwhelmed with thoughts or emotions that I have to step back. I usually just have to go somewhere alone and curl up for a little bit. My chest gets tight feeling and I start to just feel entrapped. It's incredibly embarrassing and I'm so ashamed of the problem that I have trouble even reaching out for help. This shouldn't be a concern to anyone, I mean it's a part of life, and moving on, even if it's a transition. I can sit and rationalize through it as much as I can but sometimes I just act entirely on fear. I want help, I feel like I need help. If I can't find a resolve for things soon, I fear I may result to poor tactics that really damage ad ruin my life. It's become a horrible catch twenty-two with my life that I want to be alone and isolate myself for everyone but it's in that loneliness that things become the worst and I miss everyone I use to know.  
  
Alternatively, Are there any jobs that someone with social anxiety would be good for?    
  
  
Lately I've been possessed with the concept of just wanting to turn my thoughts off. Would pursuing drugs or medications be helpful or am I just being wishful?   
  
  
Is finding someone to help this difficult? I'm not sure how to find someone when I can't really even talk to those around me about it. I also don't have a lot of money to try to pay for therapy or medication. "

I usually spend a good portion of the day worrying, but not EVERY second. I know I can't get better by myself, but the thought of being on medication and having it not work scares me to death. What else is there to do if no medications are able to help me improve.

The only medications I've tried seemed to kill my emotions EXCEPT for the anxiety.

It's frustrating to talk to anyone in real life because I don't want it to seem like I'm whining. Everyone has problems, I would rather have my family think I'm ok than have them worry about me or think I'm being a baby.

Sorry if this is jumbled, anxiety also tends to make it hard for me to put my thoughts into words."

I stupidly went down on him for about two minutes-3 min tops. He did not ejaculate in my mouth, but there might have been some precum. I kept pulling out his dick throughout the whole ordeal. I have been mental this whole weekend waiting for the window periods. This guy probably has had a lot of sexual partners. In 2013, he received a kidney transplant because he was born premature. He basically told me that his doctor keeps tabs on him. He gets medication monthly. I found his instagram account, so I know he was not lying about the surgery. 6 hours prior to the hook up, I brushed a bit hard and there was some bleeding. I hope that the wound healed, I am so fucking scared. This guy is a social guy, and drinks with friends and stuff. 

On Saturday, I started feeling a weird sensation in my throat. I still can feel it, but it is not as bad as Saturday. I couldn't enjoy my mini family vacation :(  I was basically at risk for Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and HIV, and the exposure frightens me. 

I've even made an account on POZ.com, and the admins have all told me that I didn't have a risk. My friend, who is a sexual health educator, basically scolded me because my world is ending just because I sucked a dick. Though, he understands my anxiety because he was like me. 

I can't eat much, but thankfully I can sleep. Sleeping is the only way I can soothe my body and mind from anxiety. I feel stupid, and I just want to die. 

Has anyone gone through something similar? I was reading some similar threads, and I would not mind receiving an encouraging message :( 

EDIT: Sorry that my post is everywhere. I was anxious as I was typing this :(

I am currently on Effexor (150mg daily) Lamictal (200mg daily) and Trazadone for help sleeping (100 mg)

I have tried many benzos on and off from doctors over the years and they are no longer affecting me the way they are supposed to.  After taking Xanax, I feel intense grief.  After taking Ativan, I almost become a different, mean person.  It's weird.

The only benzo that has relieved my suffering is Clonazepam, and I have developed a tolerance to that medication due to using it daily to help me get through my last partners suicide.  The medication still works, but only at high doses (3-4 mg) my psychiatrist doesn't like the idea of giving it to me on an as needed basis because of its long half life, and while I understand the point he makes, it's also hard to accept because it was the only thing that helped me through my darkest moments and panic attacks.

The ativan and xanax were giving to me by this same doctor to see how it went.  I cant contact him now because he is out of the area for another few days.

I don't know what else I can do... right now I feel so sad from the xanax.

I know all about the best sorts of therapy, breathing ect.  I went through a week long 8 hour group therapy session for attempting to commit suicide over a year ago, but none of the techniques are helping the pain of anxiety in my head and belly and my racing thoughts.

Does anyone else have any ideas on what I can try?  I'm trying 4 step breathing, thinking rationally in my head, ect.  but the feelings just wont go away.  I am at a loss.

Thank you for reading.

I used to have panic attacks quite regularly and though with meditation and a healthier life, anxiety attacks without serious triggers subsided, I still had an overwhelming sense of generalized anxiety. 

About a year ago, I got prescribed escitalopram and thought 'fuck it - I've tried most other anti-anxiety medications so why not?'.  It was a bit rockier to acclimate to (gave me horrible nausea for about three months - it hadn't even occurred to me that though it was an SSRI, it wasn't necessarily selective for neural serotonin and also affected your gut), but I acclimated nonetheless and honestly kind of liked it at first.

Over the next few months, I wasn't so anxious about getting to work or a function on time, my worst-case-scenario thoughts had dulled quite a bit and for the most part, I was comfortable.  

Then maybe about seven or eight months in, I realized my libido had dramatically decreased.  I was bloated frequently, didn't feel attractive, wasn't attracted to my partner... some more time passed and I realized I was falling out of love with him.  Fast forward to now (a year from the start of lexapro) and though I love my partner, I'm just not feelin' him at all.  Libido aside, I don't even know if I want to spend the rest of my life with him and we've built a life around that goal together.

I should mention - my libido is zero just towards my partner (or so I think).  I haven't really given it much thought otherwise but there is one person I'm attracted to that gets me wet just by looking at me, but my partner can't seem to get me on even after putting some serious work in... 

Does anyone have some insight?  Is it me, my failing relationship or my meds?  Has anyone else experienced this kind of distancing as a reaction to an SSRI?  (PS, if you haven't read Is It Me or My Meds? by David Karp and are fighting the good fight between any kind of mental 'illness' and being medicated, I recommend it).

I'm an 18 yo girl and I got dumped a month ago and I took it extremely hard, I didn't have a real meal in 2 weeks and lost alot of weight and spiraled into a deep desperate depression. Also, now I have really bad anxiety. For a while I would wake up in the middle of the night with a racing heart and sweating and feeling like I'll die alone and just feeling AWFUL. 

Recently I've been doing a little bit better, I stopped having panic/anxiety attacks in the middle of the night (the symptoms of anxiety confuse me, I don't know if they were anxiety attacks or panic attacks?) But sometimes randomly during the day, I start crying and worrying I'll never find someone else and I'll die alone and I'll never see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

I've been having dramatic mood swings, I'll go from thinking I'm way better off without my ex and I'll be happy again soon as time heals my broken heart, and then random moments come where my heart races and I'm convinced no one will ever love me again like my ex did and I'll be alone forever. 

I'm not on xanax or the other medication thats for anxiety (I'm really sorry I'm such a noob at this, the meds that start with a C) and I'm trying to get an appointment with my psychiatrist and a therapist, but I really hate relying on meds to be ""okay""

Im currently 20 sitting at my parents house getting worse and worse everyday and just don't know what to do anymore. i dont know where else to post this and am hoping typing this out calms me down.

I've had anxiety problems all my life but i always felt like i could handle them. It did cause me to miss alot of social events growing up and i've always kind of been a shut in, i was also homeschooled which didn't really help at all but i just saw all of that as part of being me and i liked being alone so whatever. But everything went downhill december of 2012, it honestly feels like thats when my life ended. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling weird like my thoughts were different or just like i was out of it and started freaking out. Eventually i was able to fall back asleep writing it off as just being tired, but i woke up the next day and while the panicky feeling was gone everything still felt different/off like i everything was just suddenly uncomfortable or something. I was freaked out but was able to keep it together for 2 more days but then in the morning i woke up and had the same thing but worse it felt like my thoughts were distant and i was having weird sensations in my head but it also felt like i was calm or drunk even though i was freaking out at the same time. I got really scared i was having a stroke or had a brain lession and ended up going to the hospital where i had an MRI and CT scan done and they took blood. Everything came back fine and they said they wanted me to see a neurologist because i was also dizzy/was shaky walking. He decided it MIGHT have been a seizure and put me on keppra just to be safe because i wanted to keep driving. I took it for awhile but eventually i kind of just started taking it here or there and it didnt really feel important since there was no proof it was a seizure and i hate taking medicines i think i dont need especially stuff that involves my brain. Meanwhile i was feeling absolutely terrible but back then i still cared enough to be embarrassed and never let on how weird i felt and how much it was ruining my life. Every thought i had i questioned like ""did i used to think like this? am i different then i was? is this normal?"" I felt super out of it all the time like everything wasnt real, i felt dull like i couldn't concentrate or like i wasn't thinking enough. Eventually stuff got kind of ok, i still felt weird/dull but it wasnt as bad and  i started thinking about stuff in the shower that wasn't about how i felt weird or how i was scared. During that time though i still got a terrible feeling if i had to go somewhere in the next week or if i thought i had a health problem. I still worried about something constantly in the back of my head. Then about 10 months later do to alot of stomach problems(which was causing alot of worry) i had to have a colonoscopy. This caused me an INSANE amount of stress even though i knew it was no big deal i was freaking out and then i was up all night trying to drink the prep which made everything worse. I got home all whoozy from the twilight anesthesia and went to sleep. I woke up at like 11pm which isnt too crazy for me and went about my night normally until about 5 am when i started to feel super out of it again like i had when this first all started. I knew immediately that i was going to feel even worse for months and months and couldnt do anything but pace around freaking out. After this i felt even worse then i did right after my first ""attack"". Weird sensations all the time, having so much trouble going to sleep since being left alone to my thoughts without a distraction causes everything to get way worse,  i have no perception of how much time has passed, remembering something from an hour ago sometimes feels weird, like its from a week ago or something. i still feel like im almost drunk all the time like its too much work to think about something sometimes. Like ive just been living in a cloud of fog ever since this first happened. Then i started feeling like i tipped over a point or something, suddenly i started losing all of my emotions and it feels like im losing connection to my body. I can't tell what i like, i can't tell if something taste good, i can't tell if i feel sick, my heart beat feels far away and feint in my head. Thats when my brother finally got me to smoke weed for the first time with an old friend that was back in town about a week ago. I took 1 big hit and we started watching a movie which i dont remember anything from. I basically just sat there while my heart rate was getting faster and faster until suddenly i felt this terrible terrible feeling in my head like i was having a stroke or my head was exploding and i thought i was dying and i started freaking out and ended up going to the hospital again where the doctor brought up anxiety/panic attacks and since i had been there before about a year ago without anything showing up i was discharged with instructions to see a therapist.  Also i had just taken my anti seizure medicine before leaving for my friends house so i guess that rules that out. This last week has just been me getting worse and worse, that feeling in my head comes and goes and i can feel my body panicking but in my head i still don't feel anything. The distant feeling is causing my more and more distress which is probably making the distant feeling be there in the first place. I feel like a zombie and trying to sleep is absolutely terrifying. ive been having super vivid dreams and i think i had sleep paraylsis for the first time last night. The feeling in my head feels like its seeped into my brain and turned into agitation like i just want to flail around or run i cant explain it. And then i started thinking about brain lessions/strokes again and i can't stop thinking about how one side of my face feels weird even though i know its from panicking/anxiety. Theres no relief from feeling scared/nothing/agitated anywhere. Everything i look at just makes me want to scream. Then this morning i had a doctors appointment with my family doctor just to get advice about everything and maybe some suggestions for therapist and to make sure it was actually anxiety/panic. Then i got in a 3 car accident on the way there because of an old person who didnt realize he was running a red light and my car is totaled so my doctors appointment got delayed until tomorrow and i don't know if i can make it. So here i am sitting here with all these weird feelings in my head hoping i don't die or have brain damage from a stroke even though this has happened before to a lesser extent and they didnt find anything. I still want to go to the hospital but i know i'd just get discharged again with nothing and my mom says its definately just anxiety and wont take me but i feel like im going to die. My thoughts feel so far away and everything seems so drained of life and meaningless. everything seems to be coated in gray that just makes me ""feel"" scared. I can't find comfort in anything and have to wait another like 14 hours to go to the doctor who will probably tell me to go see someone else in like a week. I don't know what to do. Sitting around trying to browse reddit just makes me feel even worse that i don't feel anything anymore. I can't take this feeling of being seperated from my emotions/thoughts and everything else in the world. I don't want to die i don't want to live i don't know what to do. I just wish i could go to sleep for 6 months and hope i feel better when i wake up. im not even sure why im writing this. its giving me something to do i guess. im so lost, i feel like im out of options theres no relief theres nothing. I feel so awful its impossible to even want to get it fixxed since its stressful and seems hopeless. i don't know how a therapist will help since my thoughts seem to have no effect on my body or my mood or how i feel. i can't imagine ever feeling normal again. im just sitting here not even able to cry hoping im not currently getting irreversable brain damage, questioning ever thought i have, feeling like im a level above my body and all my thoughts/emotions like i trapped outside but can look in through the window and see them. help me"

Looking for experienced help. I applied for disability back in April. In 2011 I was diagnosed with PTSD, panic disorder, anxiety and depression. Til this day doctors do not know what is the cause. Some say it was my moms passing. Others say the car accident I was in. 2 have said it could've been the mixture of meds I was given after my car accident. 

I have severe panic attacks that have had me hospitalized several times. I have left work in an ambulance several times as well. They never really found a medication that has worked for me. I've been on Xanax, Prozac, Zoloft. Celexa, Valium, Lexapro, Clonazapham, Venlaflaxine and the list goes on.

I ended up losing my job of 12 years. They told me I was missing too much time and I needed to focus on getting myself better.

I had money saved up and knew I was in bad place and just decided to the time off and get better. It's just never happened. I've had psychologist, psychiatrists and other counselors work with me and it gets nowhere. I'm just damaged goods. 

I wanted to get better and go back to work but I can't. I can't even go to the store without breaking down. I finally gave up and decided to go on disability. I applied in April. 

My bills are now stacking. I have no money. Things are so bad that I was going to force myself back to work to try to get a check while I could to provide for my son. I hear people say ""if you can work, you arent disabled"". But when your child is of need, you don't have much of a choice. 

I hear how hard it is to get on disability and there's a friend I've known since I was a kid who said she'd hire me for summer and onto the fall. I honestly don't think I'll last long before ""losing it"" but I really need money. Do I take the job and work as long as I can before another severe episode and lose possibly getting disability? Or do I just stay the course? I'm just so torn as I need to do something to provide for my son. 

How long will it take to get approved for disability? I'm worried that I won't get it and had missed out on a chance of employment although it probably wouldn't last long with my condition.

Any help?

Thank you in advance

~ A loving father"

He said the tingling is probably just compressed nerves, gave me some exercise techniques. He answered all my worries fully so I could comprehend them.

Diabetes? Artery disease? Nope and nope. What about my kidneys? They hurt sometimes. He told me to sit up straighter. The pain went away immediately. Come to find out, kidneys aren't as low as I thought they were. 

So he talked to me about anxiety. First I'd ever heard that that could be my problem. We agreed that I'd try to handle it on my own.

About three months ago I went to the hospital. I was feeling weak in all my limbs for weeks, but that day it wouldn't stop and felt like it was creeping up into my face. I noticed that as soon as I was put into a room and was being attended to, I felt fine. I wondered then if that was my anxiety. Of course, the physician found nothing and sent me on my way.

Then the breathing problems happened. It would be like an elephant sitting on my chest, or that someone had shoved cotton into my lungs. The only thing that kept me sane during these episodes was realizing I was getting plenty of air. 

Then things that normally never bothered me would trigger these episodes. My mom wanting to do nothing but smoke while we were suppose to be out together, leaving her butts in a bottle sitting in my car. My snarky sister and her rude comments. My boyfriend's jokes and tricks. It all became equivalent to nails on a chalkboard for me and would cause my breathing to become a problem. 

Then one night I felt like I literally couldn't breathe. The next night I would try to calm down and sleep through the feeling but if I stopped thinking about it, I'd forget to breathe. I'd feel sick upon realizing I wasn't breathing, then gasp for air. The next morning I went back to my doctor. I was scared they wouldn't be able to put me in which made the drive worse. But as soon as I walked in there and was told to come back a little later, I immediately felt better. 

I love my doctor. He is the best. Answers all my questions and fears in ways I would understand. He gave me citalopram and xanax to take while I waited for the few weeks it would take for the citalopram to start working.

When I first took citalopram, the generic version of Celexa, I had my first real panic attack. My heart hurt and felt like it was beating out of my chest. I got hot and sweaty immediately. It scared me so much. I took a xanax. Felt better. Haven't had anything like that since.

A lot of side effects wore off as the weeks went by and the medication worked it's magic. 

For about a week and a half, after the meds had time to set itself, I felt amazing. I felt like my old self. Little things didn't aggravate me or cause me to have anxiety attacks. I didn't feel sick anymore. Things that greatly annoyed me that didn't before didn't bother me.

But not anymore.

My symptoms and anxiety aren't as bad as they were before, but I want to feel like my old self again. I miss it. I don't like getting upset and ruining my boyfriend's fun or feeling like I have to deal with how my sister and mother make me feel. I still sometimes have problems breathing and if something greatly aggitates me I have to take a xanax. I go back to my doctor in a couple days. I just hope that that week and a half wasn't a one time thing.

I just want to go back to being happy. My old self."

A recent suggestion by my therapist was to try and put myself in situations that trigger my anxiety but while having thr safety net of escaping if I need to so I can become more comfortable in those situations and understand I have more control than I think.

Typically, if I'm not at work, playing a video game, or mindlessly surfing the web, I feel vulnerable. Anytime I don't have the ability to do one of those things I get anxiety. This then affects several other things that aren't relevant to this post.

Now sometimes I get anxiety even when doing those things I enjoy because I feel like I'm just avoiding my problems. My question is, especially in today's world, does anyone else get anxious while playing games/surfing online, and how do you cope or deal with it? I've been thinking of putting myself on a time limit (I can only play x hours a week, and only on y number of days) but I genuinely don't know what to do with those other days/hours."

For the first time, after getting my medicine, I have an anxiety attack and needed the xanex. I have been really hesitant to take it, considering it is what it is. I never thought my anxiety would get this bad, and xanex is an addictive medicine. Took a while to kick in, but after 30 minutes-1 hour, I passed the fuck out. First time waking up with no anxiety, all of my worries and problems were gone, and I honestly felt like anything could happen to me and no shits would be given.

I feel fucking great. And I am so glad I went to the doctor. For those of you scared to go for any reason at all, I highly suggest having someone that knows about your situation go with you and support you to get seen.

I lost my insurance and could not afford my medication, so over the course of a month-2 months, I halved my dose and then halved it again until I ran out. I have been without if for a few months now and my anxiety and depression are getting out of control. I find it very hard to get out of bed. I feel sick as soon as I wake up and I'll lay in bed and cry and not want to do anything. I get anxiety attacks before/during work and it has caused my work performance as well as attendance to drop. Along with racing heart, sweating, trembling, etc, I will literally get sick to my stomach and vomit from anxiety, and I have been loosing weight because it is hard for me to eat. Eating has become one of my most dreaded daily chores because food NEVER sounds appealing even when I'm really hungry, and I have to fight the urge to throw up with every bite and I feel sick for hours after.

 I have been finding it very hard to interact with my friends normally as well as I often feel uncomfortable and can't really let loose or have ""fun"" and I often just want to stay home. I feel like I have nothing to add to conversations but complaints about how bad I feel, and it's really hard to relate to anyone. I've been dating a guy and I really like him, but I haven't been able to talk to him about what's going on because I feel very embarrassed by it, but that only makes really difficult when (for example) I get sick from anxiety on a date and can't eat/have to run to the bathroom, or cancel our plans all together because I'm stuck in downward spiral of anxiety and can't stop crying/running to the bathroom. I've just been saying it's a really bad winter and I must be getting every stomach bug. I know as soon as I get back on my medicine I'll be fine again and I'm afraid of scaring off a guy I really like early on in our relationship.
I got my approval letter for insurance, but my coverage does not start until March 1st so I can begin my medications again and get back on track, however that is still awhile away and I'm having a hell of a time in the mean time. I know it's only a few weeks but every single day is a struggle and I feel like I'm just at the end of my rope here.  I already regularly practice meditation and other anxiety reduction techniques from my counseling, and try more alternative things like aromatherapy and some over the counter natural anxiety remedies, and while it helps a little big, I'm just counting down the days until I have insurance again.

So being on the medicine doesn't bother me at all. In the past 45 days of being on it I have had 2 episodes which I controlled pretty well, least in my eyes.

On the effexor I find myself not wanting to leave my home except for work and doc appointments. I use to be very out of the house type of person. Anymore I keep my mouth quiet since I have said things that have turned against me. So maybe that's a reason but has anyone else on effexor felt this way? I have talked to my doctor about it and she didn't have any advice.

I have my appointment set for next month with a psychiatrist.  This will be my first time seeing one and I am a bit nervous. I guess I am working myself up as I know it'll help me and help me through the process and growing back to my normal self. Is this a normal feeling? What should I expect in the first session or two?

I asked my original doctor to prescribe a PRN of xanax or something equivalent to help when I do have panic attacks and his reply was no that's just a quick fix. I plan on asking the psychiatrist for a PRN of something cause it's kinda like knowing that it's there just in case makes me feel a little better.

I also have ADD which I plan on talking to him about but my feat is he won't put me on anything for it because of my anxiety.

I think I am just really working myself up for this because it's a first time experience.

Over the years it kind of ebbs and flows but I've always been able to keep it together on my own and I had always hoped that I would never need medication. Lately, the last 6 months maybe, I've felt worse and worse. I started having serious abdominal pain earlier this year and even ended up in the emergency room for a day. I've been to my Nurse Practitioner's office 3-4 times this year for all kinds of tests for the pain and when nothing was found, I was sent to a gastroenterologist who diagnosed IBS and prescribed a smooth muscle relaxer, which I've been taking for a month. It's not really helping (yet).

My mental health has deteriorated dramatically in this time. I'm afraid I'm slipping into depression. This is as bad as I can handle - I think I really, really need help. I'm not sure what - therapy, counseling, medications, whatever ... I can't go on like this.

I live in the US and have health insurance. Where do I go for help? Do I schedule another appointment with my NP and ask him for a referral to someone? Do I just pick a psychiatrist/psychologist off the list provided by my insurance and contact the therapist directly? Do I start with my insurance company? What do I need to do?"

At any rate, I was on some anti-anxiety medication (paxil and later, lorazepam) from the ages between 16 and 23 (I'm 27/m now). I had convinced myself I didn't need it anymore and felt comfortable about a lot of things, wasn't losing sleep, eating better, nor fretting over things. I made friends in college, had a nice social life, and had functional relationships.

However, my last year at school, a close friend of mine passed away in an automobile accident. Originally I began medication because a friend of mine took his life when I was in highschool.

I didn't want to go back on medication because I was slowly getting off of it, but I thought it was best. Eventually, after 10 months or so, I was off. Then two months later, I stopped by my best friend's place to hang out and found him dead in his bedroom. 

At this point, I began therapy. It helped and was the first time I really sat down with someone and laid all of these things out. I was afraid that I was going to be affected by this at some extreme level. Like I was going to lose the will to have emotions for anything again. I don't know if I was depressed or what, but I lost lots of sleep but at the time time, convinced myself that none of this mattered and I had to stop thinking about it.

A month or so into therapy, I met someone through friends. Things kicked off really well and I was ecstatic to have met someone. Unfortunately, things slowly didn't work out between us (her life seemed to be a mess, she was with other people while we dated. it's an entire other story), and my therapy eventually became about this girl and what to do. How to get over this. What could I have done differently? I sort of got over her. I still think about our relationship from time to time and it will eat at me, but I have no idea why. We only dated for a month or so. 

I thought maybe I developed abandonment issues from all of this. I found myself going back to ex's and trying to establish a relationship, but it never worked out. I knew it was crazy to dig all of that past up and I completely snapped when it didn't work out and they went on their way. I was always in a state of panic. I remember looking at my friends and other people and thinking, what am I doing wrong? I still have a social life and see my friends on the weekend when we go out, but I'm easily distracted as soon as some silly thought enters my mind. Other times I stop myself and tell myself I'm being ridiculous; there are bigger problems to worry about. And thankfully, I have a social life, friends, a job, and my health.

And lately, I'm panicking nonstop.. I'm terrified that I'm at my age I have accumulated so much debt from school and have absolutely no idea what I want or should be doing. Or the fact that I still live at home bothers me endlessly. Sometimes I have a glimpse of an idea of what I really want to do, but it's fleeting. I tell myself that it wouldn't work out and I would probably get in some kind of trouble if I tried to purse it (like more debt). I volunteer at a crisis line and people call with their problems. After the phone calls, I start to wonder if I'm going to end up like that. 

To foot, I recently met someone and the both of us get along extremely well. We've been on multiple dates that are all relaxing, fun, and... well you know, just a good date. But when I get home from them, I begin to panic. Like I'm waiting for the absolute worst to happen and I anticipate have to prepare myself to feel lonely again. Sometimes if she sends a message or a text that seems aloof, it bothers me for days. I sit and analyze it until something else occupies my mind. 

Or I think of something specific, like if we get intimate, I'm going to come off awkward and it's going to be a disaster (that's also become a developing problem, but not with her. It's happened with other dates or girlfriends I've had. It never became too embarrassing as long as the other person is understanding. I'm able to play it off. ) It keeps me up all night. I feel like from here to forever, I'm just spinning my wheels. 

Should I be going back on medication? What are some things I could do?

I've had anxiety for some years now and it feels like I've come to a point where I should really try to get some help.

Some history. For some years ago I had an operation and something bad happend while I was under narcosis that nearly costed my life. After that I got anxiety and got panic attacks thinking that I couldn't breath and all that stuff.

After some time it actually got better, atleast I thought but it seemed like my anxiety just took a new shape.
Now I got problem with eating because I think it's gonna stick in my throat and block my airways and because of that just eating a simple sandwich can take me 30minutes of hard struggle trying to breath, drinking lots of water and just chewing and chewing untill the food is as small as it can be.

I've also noticed that it's just got worse and worse because before when it started I could eat a whole pizza with some struggle but now I can barely eat 1/4 of a pizza and with that I will definitly have a panic attack.

I've been to a psychologist before for this a year ago but I was stressed and didn't feel like I had time to get help also I'm really scared of doing the treatment because he wanted to treat it like phobias.

The way he wanted to treat it was that I should eat something simple and then just continue with harder and harder task at a slow pace, but I just can't seem to do that.

It's really having a big impact on my life as eating can take a hour and I might only eat half a plate even though I'm hungry and at the same time that hour is filled with torture and death thoughts.

Because of this and some other circumstances I think I've started to develope some minor depression as I really have a hard time keeping myself motivated, I get irritated with my family and I basicly feel less joy from things.


Well that's the end of my rant, I guess that I really should try to get some help but I guess I just want a push in the right direction. 
Do you think getting medication can be a good start?

I'm like you. I've been through different meds but never quite found the perfect one. I've been off meds for a year and a half after a terrible experience with desvenlafaxine, but now I've gone through a major life change and my symptoms are starting to overwhelm me again. I think it's time to get back to meds for a while. 

Next week I'm going to the doctor and I'd like to talk to him about my options. So I'd like to hear from you about your symptoms and the best and worst drugs you've been to. Below I'll do it myself in a detailed way so if you feel the same, it might be helpful:

**Symptoms:**
The main one is fear. I'm always on edge, waiting for something terrible to happen, every time my phone rings I think it's a tragedy, every time I come home I expect to find my cats dead, I never ever relax. Always a thousand worst case scenarios going through my head, and they all feel so real.

Frustration is second worst. To the point that I can't get out of bed or get super angry and aggressive or can't leave the house (it triggers the fear and makes driving especially hard).

Besides, of course, the crippling anxiety about doing important things like socializing, studying and sometimes working.

I get depressed very easily, hating myself and getting impulses to hurt myself. Haven't done it since I went off the meds, but it always goes through my head. I want to break things and stop existing. 

I don't get panic attacks (like you feel you are dying etc) but I do get anxiety attacks where I can't breathe and go crazy, and get very easily overwhelmed by my emotions. I'm very empathic and general world shittyness makes me feel horrible. Brain fog is also common.

I also have ADHD but have decided to not take meds for that, since they made my anxiety worse.

**My med history:**

- paroxetine (paxil) made me feel GREAT, but if I skipped even one dose, it made me crazy, aggressive and extremely self-harmful.

- fluoxetine (prozac) made me apathetic and completely killed my libido, which made me more depressed.

- desvenlafaxine (pristiq) made me dizzy and crazy if I missed a day. Not aggressive like the paroxetine, but extremely depressed and suicidal.

I was wondering about bupropion or sertraline. My doctor (not a psych) had suggested bupropion but I read it might increase anxiety. Please tell me your symptoms and experiences, no need to get into detail, but I do need to have things to discuss with my psych doctor next week. It would help me a lot. Thank you so much."

Before this anytime I'd get my BP checked, it was always normal to slightly high (I definitely get anxiety when at the doctor's, and I'm on birth control which I think can raise blood pressure slightly).  I didn't feel really anxious going in there until she told me the reading, then instant panic attack.  One of my biggest anxieties and sources of hypochondria is worrying that I will have a heart attack.  Also, a couple months ago, my stepdad had to go in for an unexpected quadruple bypass, and that elevated my heart-related anxieties pretty badly for awhile.

So my girlfriend has diagnosed anxiety and stuff, and occasionally she'll get anxiety attacks based on something triggering it. For this instance, its because her father is visiting and he hounds her about her meds and such. I have no experience with this, and I've never actually had any sort of anxiety issues. I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice on what I can do to help at all. Any advice would help me a lot with not only understanding this, but helping her in any way possible.
Thank you."

During my time in the military and even a deployment to the middle east I have never suffered from anxiety, in fact I would even consider it the years in which I felt at best. I was a Military Police officer and I believe that this sensation of ""being safe"" was being reinforced by being constantly armed. 

Fast forward a few years, I am in school and with my then beautiful Japanese girlfriend. This is where I start feeling stressed and feeling a bit ""insecure,"" being a bit more observant... nothing ""crazy"" occurred during this time but I was eventually diagnosed with ADD. 

Fast forward a bit more, now I am living in Japan, indexed as being one of the top ten safest countries in the world. Though, this is were I really start feeling ""insecure.""

I start seeing counselors and psychiatrists, they classify me as a type A personality and being ""hyper vigilant.""  

Their would simply lead up to the conclusion that their is nothing wrong with it, so I start practicing meditation. 

Between the time I left the US for Japan I was using ritalin and concerta. I start noticing I kept looking over my shoulder even at cafe's and only felt comfortable with my back against the wall and watching the door. At some point I couldn't get ritalin (banned in Japan) but I was able to get concerta (is it not the same? lol) 

At one point I ""broke down"" in the train and just sat and rode it all the way until it stopped. In all honesty, concerta/ritalin just wasn't for me. It was a filthy drug. 

Even when I was off it, I kept noticing my door, and I remember eating marijuana once back in the states. I had it with my girlfriend, it did nothing except come that night. She slept fine, but I recall waking up to a rush and felt someone was going to kill me lol. Even writing this now it gives me goosebumps. 

Now, first time smoking marijuana was in Japan (ironically) Mind you, I don't really like marijuana but I am a curious person. It was a good experience since I was surrounded by Japanese (girlfriend was not there, she was back stateside at this moment) at a friends apartment. Why I am mentioning this is because while everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, yet again, I kept noticing the door and felt like at any moment the police were going to barge in.

Fast forward a bit more (after my train breakdown incident and letting go of crappy ADD meds) I recall quite often, at night being in bed with my girlfriend and watching ONCE AGAIN the door. She also starts noticing how I feel uncomfortable in public places if I don't have my back against the wall. 

I am not socially declined or anything, quite the opposite if anything. I love engaging and going out, I used to avidly go to clubs, bars, and raves. My MBTI personality is ENTJ, whatever that's worth. Before joining the military I was quiet though (one of the reasons as to why I joined.) 

Fast forward a bit more and I am in the states now on business. I am here at my parents house now since I seem to have missed alllllll the damn family experiences between 2006 up until now. 

But this is where shit goes haywire, instead of noticing doors I have this overwhelming sensation that someone is going to jump at me. I keep noticing windows, and my mother even asked me why so I told her, I don't feel safe. 

The other night, their was a stupendously loud thunderstorm. I didn't know one was coming at night. I have not heard such a loud sound in my life up until now, I honestly thought it was an explosion. It must have literally hit the street next to my house. I jumped out of bed with my heart RACING. It was late at night, but I walked to my parents room. Mind you I am 26 lol, I sat at the edge of their bed since they too woke up, this is where I started shaking.... 

But before that, the night before I realized, well stumbled across something that has been bothering me. I kind of discovered what's wrong with me, you see I have a bad tendency to day dream to the point that It kind of bothers my lifestyle. I discovered maladaptive daydreaming. I told my fiancee that I felt ...sad, happy and relieved all at the same time : / 

I'm not alone lol. 

So I had slept on that night with this in mind, I also slept on reading a few articles of the bombing of Hiroshima (g/f is from Hiroshima ironically) that night I was awaken by the loudest sound I have heard. 

As I said, in my parents room, I sat on the bed shaking a little. It was pitch black and my mother started noticing it whilst the thunder was striking about and flashing. Then shook more, and all of a sudden started crying but I mean bawling. I honestly, don't know why and where it came from. When I woke up that night, the first thought in my mind was that of my girlfriend that I love so much (Hiroshima link? Lol) 

I don't know if I was crying also because I realized that up to that point that being a maladaptive dreamer I have been living a majority of my life in a fantasy. Sounds strange, but this is new to me too and I have a lot more to look into. 

But the most overwhelming feeling that night while crying was feeling stupendously insecure, I kept looking at windows again.... my mother was holding me telling me everything was fine. My father was asking the most stupid of questions (Did something happen over there? (the middle east)) etc.... 

I am really not sure what I am trying to get at here. It's past midnight and here i am typing away on a forum about this. Apparently tomorrow my mother has a psych coming to the house whom I honestly do not wish to speak to. 

But another thing is this, my mother, mentioned how I as a child would be afraid to go into the bathroom alone and also mentioned an incident in which my cousin whom I was expecting at the door scared the shit out of me and started crying. Well what does this have to do with anything, well I was in a car accident when I was young. In that accident, the most memorable thing is the NOISE of the incident, it was fucking loud. Ever since then and up to now, I have been a poor sleeper and I would always have a source of light on in order to go to bed (probably doesn't help falling to sleep) but I just felt ""safe."" 

She mentioned all this to me last night, now my parents seem quite worried. In all honesty, they think my recent interest and experimenting in nootropics is to blame, but I don't think so... 

I do plan on mega dosing L-Theanine in the future.... : / 


I also have had depression off and on, but I am totally fine now regarding that. Hmmm.... 

The only other thing I could mention is that while writing this, I still feel like something is going to happen or someone is going to  jump at me. Whether it may be jumping through a door or is looking at me through a window.... goose bumps :(  


Honestly, what the fuck is wrong? I have a clean diet, I exercise, I have an amazing girlfriend whom I plan on spending my life with, I have an amazing family..... I can speak three languages, I am motivated, I know what I want in life.......but really what the fuck..... Is their a link to my childhood trauma? I was actually never treated for it.

I suppose you can't be perfect in life eh, just another challenge to meet. I hope you guys can give me a bit of feedback, I apologize if this post doesn't have a sense of direction or isn't formatted properly. "

My medical record was finally reviewed by a psychiatrist which then switched my meds completely. One of the new drugs is Mirtazapine (7.5mg for 3 days then the full 15mg for the duration). I took a 7.5 before bed last night and I was insanely groggy in the morning and have not been able to really wake up all day. I've just been out of it. Has anyone else experienced this? I can't have this impacting work.

I should've started weeks ago but I've got a fear of medication (I hate not knowing what reaction I could have with substances as I have an unknown allergy that almost killed me in the past.)

I'm posting this to both help as a coping method as well as documenting my experience for those beginning their ssris. 

I feel weird after taking it. I get very spacey and I find completing simple tasks to be impossible. I attempted to play a card game last night after taking it but my ability to solve any problems was entirely gone. I felt sick to the stomach for the first couple of days. It's the worst right when I wake up. My desire to smoke cigarettes is beginning to fade away. I usually smoked first thing after waking up. But I find myself waiting a couple of hours first. I haven't been responding to texts or calls as I have absolutely no drive to do anything right now. The past 4 days has been sitting around playing video games (or at least trying to.) But ultimately, I do not feel as depressed as I was prior. I suppose I've been lucky enough to feel the positive effects sooner than intended. There's still a knot in my throat from my anxiety. It's triggered an attack once but I got through it far quicker than usual. I'm sure that when I begin the 20 mg doses (currently on 10 to get me adjusted) I'll feel better. The side effects suck at times but I'm rrally glad I did this. For now, I'm extremely dissatached. I space out constantly. 

This sucks. But I know it's worth it in the end. I'm taking this one day at the time, but I can slowly feel myself reaching a position I was in before I hit rock bottom, and that's wonderful. 

Thank you."

For the past 4 years I have been battling allergy like symptoms of intense burning and itching on my head, as well as adult acne and low libido. The foods that do this to me has increased significantly over that time as well as environmental factor such as dust mites etc. I have tried EVERY diet and supplement and had numerous tests done all to no avail.
It has been extremely stressful and I am a complete hypochondriac, I would research for hours and be constantly thinking and worrying about my worsening health for weeks and weeks. It has come to the point where I completely avoid social occasions with friends because I get really nervous and anxious about foods I'll have to eat, and as a result I get stressed and everything continues to get worse. These ""allergies"" are so much worse when I'm stressed and my immune system just seems to be in constant overdrive.

I never used to get emotional about this problem, but I've bottled it up for a long time and ended up getting really upset when telling my doctor about all of these problems yesterday. I've noticed my mood and general outlook on life has declined so much over these 4 years and I just think about giving up sometimes and feel really down. My mind is always racing with negative thoughts and worry, it's really awful.

My doctor told me that he thinks that food is not causing these reactions, especially since an antihistamine made me worse, and that I suffer from anxiety and depression and has prescribed me etalopro 5mg, and increase to 10mg, so I hope that this will really help. My main fear of this medication is because my ""allergies"" are now so broad that I know that these pills will set me off, but my doctor has told me just to keep going regardless of what they do to me. Has anybody else experienced increased allergies as a result of anxiety, or noticed an improvement with medication?

Here a rant if you want to know more about my symptoms. TL;DR 
Below

**Rant**  


--I am 24(F) and I still have my learner’s permit. I live in Central Florida and if you know anything about it, its big, the public transportation sucks, and it’s full of crazy ass drivers. It’s nice to know that I am not the only one that seems to have this issue. I feel like it might help to actually spend the money on a professional driving instructor because I will be less inclined to freak the hell out in front of a stranger. Still, haven’t been able to actually get up and call one of these places and usually just make up another excuse to why I don’t.   

--I had a job interview the other day. I cried for 3 hours before the interview and I can’t even pin out why.  I actually managed to keep my cool once I got there and I got the job.  Now my new problem is that I lose all ability if someone is watching me and turn in to a clumsy moron but I can usually keep up otherwise. Of course, then I can’t help but dwell on the fact that I just messed up something I have done perfectly freaking seconds ago.   

--My poor boyfriend. I’ve broken down and freaked out about our relationship more than once. At this point I don’t even know what’s justified and what’s not but I am pretty sure I am once again overthinking everything and am in danger of crossing the overly attached girlfriend status which makes my anxiety even worse.  I shouldn’t worry about whether my boyfriend actually loves me or not, that fact that he puts up with my shit is proof enough.   

**TL;DR**  
I am tired of stressing out my boyfriend and having him drive me everywhere and I hate always feeling like I have to puke, and that my heart is always racing. I want to be done with freaking out over regular everyday normal human crap. I am tired of feeling helpless, sleepless nights, and crying. Why do I always have to cry? It’s a never ending circle. I can’t even enjoy drinking anymore (not that it good for me anyway) as I usually break down emotionally 10x.   

I have never been diagnosed or treated, am I a candidate for medication (what about side effects, possibly with birth control)? Are there medications that I should flat out avoid? I should try non-med therapy? I am already getting anxious about talking to the doctor, what do I say? I don’t want him to think I am just trying to get a prescription. Can a “primary care” doctor even do anything or just send me elsewhere? I will probably not have health insurance by the end of the year (fml) so I want to take action while I can afford it.  Thank you for reading all this crap.

After years of denial, I'm FINALLY addressing my anxiety issues with the doctor tomorrow. I've finally come to terms with the fact that I need meds...for whatever reason it bothers me greatly to go on meds. I've studied psychology (just graduated with a degree in it, actually) and I know anxiety can be the same thing as diabetes; both can be manageable with no medication, but sometimes meds are necessary. No idea why it bugs me, but it does.

Anyways, I'm fat as fuck and part of my anxiety comes from that. I hate it. I'm terrified that any medication I go on will make me gain weight. Is it highly inappropriate to ask the doctor to keep that in mind when prescribing me something?   

Any advice you can provide would be great, thanks! "

I have been a long time sufferer of mild anxiety and mild depression, but recently, my anxiety has come back and its full blown. I will be graduating, moving &amp; starting a new job very soon and my normal spunky self could not be more excited. My anxiety however, is totally taking over my positive energies. 

In the past four years, my anxiety and depression have totally subsided and I have learned to control any mild anxiety moments I might have. But in the past four months, I've totally changed. Up to multiple times a day, I feel sick and so anxious. My stomach goes in knots, I get sweaty and light headed and I can barely move, think, or speak. As a result, my free spirited, outgoing personality that I have built up over four years is falling apart. I get debilitating anxiety just if I'm laying in bed watching a movie and a friend texts me to go to the bar. The sheer thought makes me so anxious, where in the past I would have been more than excited to meet up with friends. 

After trying to cope with meditation and other methods, I feel as though I would benefit from seeing a psychiatrist and receiving some short lasting medication, and was wondering how medicine has helped anyone in a similar situation to me. I know the dangers of becoming addicted to benzos etc...I just want to know how medicine has or has not helped any of you. Thank you! "

My dad has been on somewhat of a downward spiral for the past 3 years. He defiantly experiences narcissistic episodes and has been diagnosed bipolar but he has always been in a difficult state of denial about it. He's also a neurologist who can teach you fascinating theories and facts for hours but he lost his doctors license due to lack of continuing certain certifications one needs every several years. He got into gambling and sort of just stopped putting effort into doing more with his career. I know it sounds bogus but he's been dealt a lot of traumatic experiences that have slowly worn him down so what's happened is slightly understandable. 
He was evicted 2 years ago so I let him live with my partner and I for about a year in our tiny one bedroom flat. He was clearly depressed staying with us and nothing was coming of it. I tried but it just was too much for everyone. Not to mention the amount of visible panic attacks i had triggered by the cramped space. He finally moved in with a friend of his across the country about half a year ago and now things aren't looking great over there. 
He claims to put out job apps for anything but rarely gets genuine responses. Last week he broke down on the phone with me asking for cash just to take the bus to a part time gig he has. He told me some weird health issues he's been having and says he's lost weight. God I just picture him nothing but bones... It's awful. My brain is filled with horrifying images of what he must look like now. 
He told me can't take it anymore and wants to just go hitch hike off to wherever he ends up. I'm basically the only family member that supports him financially and emotionally - I also have anxiety disorders that make the simplicities of daily life a series of drastic decisions most of the time. 
I've grown much more disciplined in managing that obnoxious mental swill of mine but knowing someone I love is so screwed is more weight than I can handle. This has been damaging my sleep cycle the past two weeks. I can barely go 3 hours without startling awake infused with nightmares and bits of my OCD and anorexia have reared their ugly heads. I sought CBT and took meds for this particular conundrum before but honestly just want someone to talk to that gets it rather than another terrified look and unnecessary apology for my situation. My friends have all heard the story before. Their advice is confused and the therapy I've had just tells me something along the lines of letting him go and moving on with my life without helping him. It's my incredibly intelligent loving dad whom I am fully aware is mentally ill beyond his own control... How the fuck am I suppose to simply write him off? Anyways in the past when I've multitasked so many different states of anxiety-   Suicidal ideation usually kicks in. I so would like to avoid that now but unfortunately it's a bit too late. I feel like the smallest disturbance could set me off any day now. I know, it sounds really dramatic but I probably wouldn't be posting this much personal info on reddit if I wasn't worried and a bit desperate. So ok: Has something similar happened to you? "

This is different than 'things I've always wanted to do' or 'I wish I could ...' - these are things I would do if fear wasn't stopping me. Part of me knows that there is some rational fear behind some of these things and that I probably _shouldn't_ do some of them. 

But anyway here is my list. The only edit is to remove a co-worker's name. Please post your list below. 

**What would you do if you weren't afraid?**


* I’d tell my boss that I love technology and I want to be a super nerd and code and do server stuff and bathe in the technology not be pushed into management and leadership like he wants. Fuck him

* I’d tell _co worker_ that I’m afraid of asking him to do stuff because he always argues

* I’d quit my job and move to vancouver

* I’d tell my parents that although I love them very much I need some time away from them. I’d tell my sister the same thing

* I’d tell my niece that her mom is raising her the same way my parents raised me, and I understand how much she hurts and she can talk to me any time, about any thing. 

* I’d tell my other sister she needs medication for her depression

* I’d wear my diapers proudly and without fear

* I would fix people’s computers and bill them, for the obscene amount of money I deserve

* tell the CEO how much she hurts me when she bullies me

* be alone with my own brain for a day

* Have a conversation with a stranger

[update] In the light of day, some of these seem extra crazy (I should be afraid) and many seem like 'i could do that'. Heck, I think I'm going to do two of these today. Also, a new one:

* I'd be a proud and strong nerd, and never try to hide it - never try to pass as a 'normal' person"
389,0.9999269321398571,7.306786017039033e-05,0.136,0.738,0.125,"Basically I'm schizophrenic, and while my psychiatrist and care worker will give me help and meds for the psychosis, they don't seem to care about the anxiety attacks that I experience daily, and everywhere.  Right now I'm thinking I'm being monitored by my neighbours so typing this is very embarassing, but screw it.  Every single day when I hear them come down the stairs of the building I feel like they're gonna break down the door and kill me (or at least beat me up and rob me).  I have a walking stick I have to use sometimes and I like having it near me, in case I need a weapon to defend myself.
 
Going outdoors is terrifying.  I'm better at doing it before, but it's actually getting harder and harder each time.  I have to prepare by meditating, again for longer and longer each time, and checking myself in several mirrors to make sure I'm not hallucinating that I've put clothes on and they're actually there, and my zipper is done up, and I even sometimes take photos of myself.  Then when I actually go outside I hear constant laughter, and I don't know whether that's a hallucination, or just misinterpreting real people's laughter, but it's like being paraded down the street as a huge laughing stock, and because I can never work out exactly why everybody is laughing and staring I get anxiety attacks and have to run into shops or bars to hide.  Whern walking past someone on the sidewalk I very often stumble because my legs tense up or something and get weak, and that's embarassing.  I can't urinate in public bathrooms anymore.  I used to be fine if I went in the stall but even that I can't do anymore cos I think people can see through the walls.  So I have to either be dehydrated or have a painful bladder.

Every single noise scares me when I'm in my apartment.  I can hear people laughing from the street outside and I'm convinced it's cos they can see inside my apartment, so I've been blocking up the windows with sheets of thick paper and making sure the curtains are fully closed, and it's pretty dark in here now but it helps a bit.  I'm constantly being observed and filmed wherever I am, which is pretty annoying. 

I've apparently been really really tense recently because I had to go to the emergency room for chest pains and tightness and uncontrollably fast breathing.  There's nothing wrong with my heart and they think it's chest muscle strain.  But every time I feel pain in my chest I get very worried it's a heart attack and I sometimes try not eating for a day or something so I have a lower chance of it, or something.

I guess the point of this is do I need some kind of anti-anxiety medication, temporarily?  I'd rather not have more and more pills as I already take loads every day anyway, but they'd be better than drinking in the morning before I leave my apartment, which is the only thing that helps at the moment.  But my psychiatrist doesn't seem to care about it, or address it, and I've asked him directly about it.  I've never not had social anxiety to an extent, so it's a separate thing from the schizophrenia.  No anti-psychotic has ever got rid of my symptoms, just got rid of some of the anxiety from them, but I've never been good at going outside, sometimes going days without food because I run out and am too scared to buy any.

I doubt anyone has read this far but if you have, thank you.  I needed to write this all down even if I didn't post it here, because it makes it easier somehow.  Of course I've had to type it with my wireless off so my neighbours can't access it, and then very quickly post it.  Of course they can still read my thoughts so that doesn't help much I guess.

390,0.21553730317553188,0.7844626968244692,0.142,0.709,0.149,"I'm a 33 year old man who has struggled with anxiety for years. I have generalized anxiety with obsessive and focused worries. About a year ago my first serious girlfriend, and the only person I've ever loved, broke up with me. It was difficult (which is expected) and made worse by my anxiety (also expected) but I mostly dealt with it and have since gotten into a new relationship that is several months old.

For almost a month I have felt serious anxiety about relationships. I have felt unsure about my feelings for my new girlfriend even though I can rationally acknowledge that she's a great person and that things are going well and much better than my last relationship, which definitely had its problems. I keep doubting whether I feel strongly enough to be able to fall in love with her and ultimately take the next steps (moving in together, marriage, etc.), I doubt whether I find her attractive enough, etc. Basically I have this need to ""feel sure"" about so much despite knowing that I can honestly say she's a pretty and wonderful caring person who I get along well with.

Coming up against this is the fact that I still think a lot about my ex. Not in a heart-broken way exactly; I just think a lot about the relationship. I think back to fights we had, good times we had, ask myself lots of what-ifs, and imagine how she would respond to different things I think and say right now. Sometimes it's just a bunch of thoughts that run around my head, other times it's quite upsetting.

My therapist tells me that the problem is my fear over really putting myself in this new relationship and really committing myself (not commitment in the relationship sense, he means more my intentions towards her). He says this is why I keep thinking about and idealizing a past relationship that was ultimately not a very good one, and using it to convince myself that the current one isn't good enough.

I think this makes sense and I'm trying to work with it, but after almost a month of obsessing...I'm just so tired guys. I keep worrying and I keep doubting, and I think about it all the time. I try to do all the stuff I'm supposed to do to calm myself and change my thinking (therapy, changing self talk, mindfulness, meditation, medication, exercise, etc.). And it just doesn't seem to be changing anything. I'm just really scared about my current relationship, though I can't give a definite reason. We've been dating for four months so it's still early, but there have been no ""red flags"". But I'm scared about taking any next steps with her. At the same time I'm scared of taking any actions based on my irrational thoughts. But I'm sure you know that even when I can identify them they aren't that easy to ignore.

I'm starting to ramble, sorry. I guess I just want to know if other people deal with this in new relationships and if they can offer any advice or encouragement. That goes double for anybody who has gotten therapy for Relationship-based OCD, which matches a lot of what I'm talking about. Thanks.

TL;DR - I have had anxiety issues for years, and I am feeling all sorts of anxiety over a new relationship and whether I'm ""sure enough"" about it or it's ""good enough"" despite the fact that I know it is. I'm scared of things getting more serious until I can address or quell these thoughts."

I have been feeling awesome, been able to enjoy life again, got my sex drive back. I was at a point where the effects would not fade over night and I'd wake up feeling great.
About a week ago I changed the time that I take them from 6:30 to about 8 o'clock so that I could sleep in every now and again. Since I did that, I went about 3 days where the meds weren't seeming as effective, but that has seemed typical that every two weeks around the same time I'd have a few days like that. Now they're effective again but now I'm back to where the effects will fade over night and I feel okay, but I don't feel ""great"" until about an hour after I take the meds.
Anyway, my questions is, is this change associated with the change in time of taking it and things should go back to normal or do I need to ask the doctor to up the dose from 10mg to 20mg? I'm weary to up the dose because I haven't had any side effects at all ( other than a delayed orgasm and being hyper sexual), and I'm afraid that if I up the dose side effects will pop up.
Would appreciate anyone who can share their experience with Lexapro and SSRIs in general. Thank you!"

Taking prilosec solved mist of my problems. However, tonight before bed I sprayed my nose with oxymetazoline hcl and after about half an hour of sleep I woke up with a racing heart. That was two hours ago and I still haven't been abke to calm down. I know it's a side effect of the medication but it brought back that intense fear from anxiety that I'm dying and no one will know hecause I'm the only one who's awake. "
393,0.8746524704882613,0.1253475295117316,0.127,0.778,0.094,"Ok,  so here's the basic layout of my life. I'm 28 years old, male,  super optimistic and generally always in a good mood.  Yet for years now I've suffered with mild to intense anxiety.  

I honestly still haven't found my core triggers for it. I do notice it's much worse when im in a bar, a crowded place, being around people I don't know,  or being in a car. 

The only places I know I don't see to be effected by it is at home and at the gym (I workout daily, but always with headphones on)  and that makes life super tough because I travel for work. 

The anxiety gets so bad that I've hyperventilated by just being in a crowded hospital.  It's caused me many times to have to pull over off the road because someone was driving even slightly reckless near me, if I need to speak to people I haven't met in person I tend to stutter or just speak super fast, I have night terrors quite often where I wake up yelling yet I never remember what I was dreaming about. 

Only pertinent history I have is I spent 5 years in the Marine infantry as a navy medic, and my family owns a boxing gym so I grew up boxing and since I live in a small town people always wanted to prove themselves against me no matter how much I'd try to back down (pretty sure this is the core root of my bar problems)  and since I'm a larger guy 6'1"" 215 lbs mostly muscle people would constantly harass me for a fight. 

Anyways all this set aside, I discussed everything with my doctor at the VA hospital here and I have an appointment to see the mental health clinic to get treated.  So I'm wondering for those who suffer from similar situations what was your bodies reaction to the treatment/medication. I honestly have no idea about any anxiety meds or anything... 

Thanks for your time."

I have an invitation to a social situation coming up later in January. In spite of my social anxiety &amp; general anxiety, I really want to participate in it (you can think of it as a party).

Problem is, I'm really anxious about it. I'm afraid of ... I'm not sure what. Making a fool of myself? stepping out and being exposed? Of shame?

I'm worked up, and I think it's making me physically ill. I'm coming down with something as I type and I think the stress of worry is causing it.

I have meds but meds are meds (in other words I still feel this anxiety) &amp; I don't have enough ativans to keep popping them over the next 10 days or so.

Anything you can say to help is appreciated."

I've been in therapy off and on for many years now.  I've been in steady therapy for the past 3 years with periods of intensive therapy (2-3 sessions a week).
I get cobbled back together, start to rejoin life, only to be crippled again by the anxiety.  It's to the point where I'm ashamed to even admit how bad it is with my therapist.  It feels like I would be disappointing her, or it would somehow be insulting to her (I acknowledge that's a messed up thought, but it is what it is).
I'm considering going back on meds.  Part of me really doesn't want to, but another part knows this isn't going away even with the therapy so what alternatives are there?  A giant part of why I'm anxious about seeing a psychiatrist is I've been misdiagnosed before, and been on the wrong meds.  Misdiagnosed because I wasn't forthcoming with my history.  Rationally, I know, but feelings are anything but rational.
I guess I'm just looking for support to get that referral from my GP.  Thanks."

I guess I'm posting on here because I don't know what to do. I don't want to go back on medicine. I also am worried about telling my parents, I don't want to worry them. Any advice? Anyone share my fear?"
397,0.837984041488053,0.1620159585119361,0.136,0.653,0.211,"First off, im not a doctor or mental professional, im just a regular dude. I uses to suffer from social anxiety disorder and ADD/ADHD. My anxiety was caused by ADD problems and getting bored of social situations in general. I fixed my ADD problems and as a result my anxiety decreased so low that i dont have to suffer anymore. I have an anxiety disorder and attention problems, the difference is that i dont suffer anymore. 

Okay so anyway, this might be helpful to people that read a lot about anxiety and their causes and potential treatments or people that are just curious. I am going to list some thoughts or ideas in list format. 

Number 1: it is COMPLETELY normal to feel anxious, but it is NEVER okay to feel overwhelmed, be aware of that. 

Number 2: there are many potential causes for anxiety and dysfunctional behaviors and EVERYONE suffering from an 'anxiety disorder' has a ROOT cause. It could be a combination of genetic susceptibility, poor diet, lack of exercise, adrenal fatigue, nutritional deficiencies like (magnesium), very poor sleep, emotional trauma or excessive emotional stress. Chances are if you suffer from an anxiety disorder, you NEED to fix all of these areas with TIME. 

Number 3: you will never fix an emotional problem from 8 in the morning to 8 in the night, think LONG TERM.

Number 4: the reality is, is if ur burned out, chances are you'll need 1 to 2 months to turn to the other side by INCORPORATING positive habits that are good for treating the disorder. 

Number 5: a brain fog is a dangerous state to be in because you are being attacked by ur mind and you have no defenses to protect urself from self inflicted emotional harm. 

Number 6: the reality is HORMONES are everything, balance ur hormones, balance ur life.

Number 7: ELIMINATE ALL refined carbs like white bread, ALL yeast, ALL high fructose corn syrup, ALL simple carbs. If you want keep eating any meat or vegetables, but moderate the fatty foods you eat like fried chicken (which is NOT as devilish as the carbs and yeast i mention above. Simple and refined carbs are PUBLIC ENEMY NO 1. 

Number 8: the first days are very difficult after cutting sugar(carbs), you will feel dead. Take about 3 to 7 days to incorporate healthy complex carb eating, protein, and fats. 

Number 9: Diet is CRUCIAL for anxiety issues. Eat more nuts, vegetable, and fruits.

Number 10: people with ADD/ADHD like me that dont take stimulant medications NEED exercise! For people with anxiety disorders this is also the case!! 

Number 11: sleep is very important!! Buy a sleeping mask because the slightest light can inhibit HGH, an important hormone!

Number 12: Fast! Fasting for 24 hrs boosts HGH 2000% in men and 1300% in women. It is a crucial hormone, especially for people that are susceptible to internal damage like people with anxiety disorders. 

Number 13: give urself some love and buy a multivitamin, magnesium supplement, fish oil supplement, and the chances are that ur digestive system is off because of constantly being in fight or flight so buy probiotic lactobacillus GG from culturelle which is a good brand. I drink 1 multi a day, 650mg Mg, 6 fish oil pills (for ADHD), and 20 billion bacteria which equates to 2 pills of probiotic. 

Number 14: get sum vitamin D! Expose urself to the sun daily at ur discrepancy because it is reported that people are happier than people who stay indoors. If u dont have a sun, get urself some more pills to get vitamin d into ur system. 

Number 15: shower with epsom salt. It relaxes ur body because ur body absorbs highly the magnesium found in the product. 

Number 16: to fix ur brain, you must fix ALL addictions to become happier. Addictions highjack the dopaminergic system and decreases pleasure for regular activities like socializing and such. 

Number 17: isolation is the key to anxiety. U can be alone, but not lonely. Happiness can only be found within, but having social interaction is crucial because we are hardwired for being in human contact. Even being in another persons presence is enough, dont hide urself inside a room. 

Number 18: meditating for 30 minutes for 8 weeks can increase ur hypothalamus. This is crucial for people with adhd and anxiety disorders because most people with those conditions tend to have smaller than avg. this area of the brain is responsible for the important factors of LEARNING, MEMORY, and EMOTION. 

Number 19: practice abdominal breathing exercises for at least 10 minutes a day. This helps the oxygenation of ur cells, and decreases stress hormones. 

Number 20: never put urself in a situation that is overwhelming for u because this reinforces ur anxiety.

Number 21: relax the most u can. The more relaxed u are the better, but in work and school those are not the perfect places to be relaxing because ur brain needs to be making complex decisions that are for the most part absent in a relaxed, alpha wave state. Note: all genius ideas come from an alpha wave state. 

Number 22: in small chunks, expose urself to the smallest things that u are anxious about.

Number 23: relaxing the muscles is crucial for people that are always on high alert. An easy way is drugs, but the best way is thru yoga, stretching, and others to relax ur muscles. TRUST ME, relax all ur muscle, it is IMPOSSIBLE to feel anxious. 

Number 24: many people have laughter or crying deficiencies. Try laughter yoga with a group or by urself and laugh at the stupidest moments of life. 

Number 25: hygiene is important. 

Number 26: fix ur hair, body, and appearance to a cleaner, better looking you. 

Number 27: everyone has root insecurities about themselves, the problem is not having them but suffering from them. How do u not suffer if u have insecurities? Self awareness of course! How do u develop that? In general, Positive habits and the original mindfulness meditation!

Number 28: in the end all the positive habits  form more emotional freedom within urself and that is the key to freeing urself from the belligerence of mental disorders. 

Number 29: dont be blind by success, stay true to u and keep doing what ur doing and keep away from being blinded by others admiration. 

Number 30: not all of these tips will apply to u and as with everything, not everything is for everyone. Apply what is suitable to u and make ur own personal program. 

Hey guys im just tryn to help and i know how debilitating it is living like crap. I went from being a pile of **** to living like my own prince. This program is for LIFE, but you should see 90% improvement within 2 months in ur living conditions. There will be times where u just want to throw in the towel, but those are the times that u have to dig deep and keep pushing. Inertia is hard to move, but once u have the momentum everything becomes much easier all of the sudden. There will be times where u are doing everything right and everything goes south, thats a very bad feeling, but in the end it pays off. The worse you feel during ur recovery period, the better because in time u will feel equally, but in the positive direction. My recommendations are meditation 30 a day, aerobic exercise 30 a day, supplements listed above, restricted eating habits, sleeping better, better social connections and so on. Also i recommend at least 1 month off of EVERYTHING to fire the inertia into the right direction. After that it is much easier to keep going the momentum during school or work related occupations. 

Okay a little about me: 

Went thru worst bouts of social anxiety. Now after 2 months worth of recovery time i feel 90% better, if not 95%. I have other ideas i didnt mention, but if i did write them id write a novel. I love people, and i especially want others to succeed, especially when other people dont understand how diabolical anxiety disorders are. I want to write a book on anxiety and make a website someday about it to help millions of people suffering from anxiety disorders.

In the end if nothing works dont be afraid of getting medical help, even if drug therapy is a definite option. The reality is that drugs help, but they wont fix ur problems, but they set the stage for u to fix them. Being on drugs under medical supervision is potentially a very good way to incorporate and shape ur positive lifestyle. You can do it without drugs, but remember, you always have AN OPTION to get BETTER. 

Love to all

It's been about a year now on the meds, and my anxiety and obsessive thoughts have been basically null. The only strange thing that I haven't really gotten used to is feeling even and neutral most of the time. It seems like spontaneous feelings of elation and giddiness aren't as accessible as they used to be. Has anyone had this problem and do you take supplements or anything to get that happiness boost? "
399,0.8884259046477206,0.1115740953522621,0.135,0.763,0.102,"Hey guys, I've never been/lurked in this subreddit before, so sorry if this is the wrong spot to post this but I just needed some advice.

So my SO is currently on the highest dosage of Cipralex (Idk what dosage that would be, I think she said 20mg? I dont remember), and has been for a year now. We've been together since November, and she's opened up to me about it in February. We haven't had sex many times, but her sex drive is pretty much non existent, and she has never orgasmed before in her entire life (in HS she felt guilty about it, and the was on AD's so she never got a chance to). Things aren't that great sex wise because her AD prevent her from feeling anything down there (we've tried oral, fingering, sex toys, etc). Now, don't get me wrong, I'm totally supportive of her being on ADs and have never pressured her to change medications or stop taking them, because sex isnt important enough for me to make her stop taking something that makes her feel normal, and good. It's just something we talked about together, and she's considered changing medications because nothing else was helping her orgasm. She has an appointment next week with her doctor so she's going to talk to the doc about switching and even lowering her dosage. 

She's nervous of lowering her dosage though because she's scared she'll go back to the place she was in before. I asked if she feels ready to lower her dosage and she says she does, but she's scared that if she goes back to being depressed, she'll be tempted to shut everyone out because when you're depressed, even irrational thoughts seem rational (her words). 

I don't know if this is a thing but, I'm wondering if her worrying about going back to her depressive state, will make her over think things, and actually cause her to start seeing symptoms again. I realise it must be so scary to have to take that big step and start lowering your dosage because you're slowly letting go of something you've been relying on to feel normal and happy, so I don't blame her for being a little nervous. (IDK if i'm making her sound paranoid, she actually isn't, I think her level of nervous is normal).

Anyways, I was wondering if there's anything I should do to make her feel comfortable with this; I want to do anything I can to support her. I've never been in this situation before so I don't know what the right thing to say or do is. I've told her that I will always be there for her to support her, especially if she starts feeling that way, and if I ever sense her shutting people/me out I will help her go back to her counsellor so they can give her the help she needs. 

Also, since she's on a higher dosage of Cipralex, would she have weird effects when changing her medication to something that's a little more libido-friendly? I know you guys aren't doctors, I just want to get an idea of what to expect, and maybe pass on some info to her too. 

Thanks guys :)

New symptoms not present before:
-Pain in left arm (only began today) and it went away after a few hours, has not returned
-the feeling of something stuck in my throat permanently 
-my limbs go numb really fast when I sleep on them (never used to)
-very constipated(I get enough fiber and drink lots of water)
-my throat feels incredibly dry all the time even after a healthy dose of water throughout the day 
Returning symptoms:
-the feeling of my heart dropping in my chest 
-churning stomach as If I were nervous all the time
-shortness of breath

Last time this happened I had a handful of EKGs done and all looked fine, I'm keeping my meds and aspirin at hand when I sleep in case of emergency but this is driving me insane, I keep having paranoid thoughts of an impending heart attack. I'm worried about working tomorrow because I don't want to have to take meds while on the job, or if I will be allowed to at all.
Anyway, just wanted some opinions/thoughts I don't expect a professional medical opinion of course but reassurance is always helpful especially when someone speaks from experience and I've felt this before and pulled through but these new symptoms are what are fueling my paranoia right now, thank you for any responses and stay strong everyone!

401,0.6363663228818895,0.3636336771181175,0.073,0.749,0.178,"So for many years since about 15 years old i've suffered from anxiety which has then led to depression.

It comes like waves however over the years the dark has been winning against the light i'd say my life was about 70% darkness and 30% light 

I have been having wild thought's on doing things such as fleeing to join the french foreign legion, killing myself etc.

My doctor was very worried for me an immediately gave me a prescription of 20mg CITALOPRAM

It's only been 1 and 1/2 days but man i already feel fantastic. I feel really balanced and those feelings we get about people judging us, self loathing etc are starting to retreat 

If I could describe how i felt it would be balanced, i feel really balanced and i feel at peace.

Talking to people isn't as bad anymore and im not terrified of speaking to girls either.

It's only been a very short time but im excited to see where i am in a month, Im determined to also start therapy and seeing psychologists and psychiatrists to help me with my issues as i want genuine progress and make.

Only side effects have been some yawning, a little dry mouth but i can still wank and i still feel horny just takes a little longer but it's better as i was wanking like 5 times a day before

so ill hopefully give an update in a month too see where i am and how im going

also starting a nice execrise and diet program on monday to shed that 10kg's i want and get a sixpack for summer yew

feeling good people, id suggest trying medication for those at are afraid it may work for you so don't look for reviews online because if i listened to them i'd say nope wont work and wouldn't be enjoying myself as i am now."

I'm not sure if the meds are speeding things along, or if I'm just THAT out of shape. I talked to my doctor about weight gain briefly a while ago, and he suggested that it isn't normally a big deal. In the 2-3 month since then I've gone from medium to large shirts, and maxed out my belt size. It's not a crazy insanely fast weight gain, but it's significantly faster than I used to gain weight.

I'm 26, male, and I could certainly be leading a healthier lifestyle, but since I haven't changed my lifestyle but have suddenly begun gaining weight, I wonder if it's the drugs.

Anyone else experience this?"
403,0.9669159697653904,0.033084030234643035,0.205,0.705,0.089,"I have not posted anything about my anxiety problem in over a year, but as of right now, I feel extremely depressed due to losing hope dealing with my condition. 

This all started back in 05' after a bad weed trip. I thought I was having a heart attack when it turns out it was my first panic attack. Something that night (Dec. 15th 2005 - I will never forget it) stuck in my head. I thought I had a heart problem. For the next 6 to 8 months, I saw 3 cardiologists and all test both major and minor came back fine. 

For a few years after that, I dealt with some minor panic / anxiety issues and it really did not hinder my daily life. As time progressed, I started having panic attacks everywhere. Driving, the mall, the doctors office, etc...

Still, at this point, I was not an agoraphobic and I knew things were getting worse for I started avoiding certain things. In 2012, I went and saw my first therapist, but the lady was a moron and I quickly realized I was wasting $150 per session. In 2013, I decided to see another lady and she was great, but at that point in my life, I setup a safe zone around my house. Her old office was in this safe zone, but she moved after 4 or 5 sessions. I did manage to make it to her new office once with mild anxiety but the second time was horrible. I did stay for the full hour, but I asked her 28 times to call an ambulance for I thought I was having a serious cardiac event. Needless to stay, since I had a major panic episode there, I never went back. 

This safe zone is still in place. It is about a 2 mile radius from my house and there is a big hospital located within the zone. 

Since that happened, I figured I would go and see a professional about medication. I found a local psychiatrist that was in my safe zone. After my first visit, he told me I was severely depressed and proscribed me paxil. I did some research on the drug and was very hesitant to take it. I did take it for 5 days when all of a sudden I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life. I never took it again.

I went back to him about a month later and then he told me I was bi-polar. Again, I quickly realized this guy was a joke after telling me I was bi-polar after talking with me for about 10 min.....no bullshit. 

So that was my last time looking for professional help. I started to do a lot of self research and bought countless programs (panic away, etc...). 

I do know exactly what I have and what caused it, but I have no clue how to fix this.

I decided to reach out to this community today because 3 things happened today.

1. I was cooking with my family at home and had to stop and lay in my bed for the panic/anxiety was bad. 
2. My younger brother just moved out and was telling me about all the great thing he was doing, people he was meeting, etc...
3. I realized I have formed an alcohol problem. Over the past 4 or 5 months, I would drink 2 to 4 beers before I HAD to go out to the grocery store, get a hair cut, etc...

After all my family left, I crept away to my bed and have been laying here for hours contemplating my condition. 

I am a 29 yr. old male. I have my own business (work from home) that is successful, but it could be so much more for I do not want to go see them at their place of business, thus, limiting a lot. 

I make great money, drive a brand new truck, own 2 homes, but I am still in this funk. 

When I do go out (when I am sober) I get this overwhelming sense of fear and dread. I get light headed, weak in the legs, etc..

I always think I am going to die of a heart attack.

I CAN NO LONGER LIVE THIS WAY. I FEEL LIKE I AM GOING CRAZY! What is really scaring me is two things:

1. I am getting these new feelings of dread/depression where I get very scared and confused. 
2. Thoughts of suicide are creeping in more and more. I dont think I would ever do anything like that, but I hate the thoughts. 

Please, please, please share your advice.

At first I only used Xanax (prescribed .5 mg as needed) to control my panic attacks but I can handle those due to therapy nowadays and they are not nearly as common as they used to be. However, I have had this compulsive thought that I have obsessed over for about 3-4 years (I have been taking medication for OCD since kindergarten, same dosage, just fyi) and it is very hard to describe; I just keep thinking about how I don't get how I can move my body, like just all of a sudden I'm moving my body and I don't know how I am doing that, and then that makes me afraid that I am not going to be able to move my body or something and it just keeps on going like that. I consider myself a pretty active person, but I got into the habit of taking a Xanax (again, .5 mg) before a run because something about the repetitive nature of running makes me have those thoughts, and thus a panic attack. I run pretty frequently and have been running for awhile, and have been taking a Xanax before hand for awhile and nothing bad has happened at all, but now I am worried that this could cause problems for the future. I feel like I take the Xanax not for the prescribed effect (honestly, I can't even feel a difference in myself after I take one) but just for the mental effect of knowing that I am ok. Is there anything wrong with doing this? Should I try to back off the Xanax and talk to my doctor about getting my OCD medication upped? I don't want it to be this way forever, but I also would prefer not to have panic attacks when I go on a run. "
405,0.02138020688850839,0.9786197931115099,0.076,0.822,0.102,"Ever since I got back from visiting my family for Christmas, this wave of anxiety and depression has hit me, so I went into recovery mode.

I had one good day this week, as far as coping goes. Everyday I seem to end up in a tailspin of procrastination behaviors, like cleaning week-old dishes, finally vacuuming, digging up old projects I never finished, and of course retail therapy. Even getting out of the house to work on my thesis or do errands, I end up coming home much earlier than planned because I can't get focused and *stay focused*. I've spent hours staring into space or starting a bunch of things I forget to finish (just discovered a wet load of laundry in the washer from last week).

Yesterday I got my haircut (didn't wait too long to schedule it for the first time ever) and then took myself out to dinner. It didn't feel as awesome to take care of myself as usual - it just felt time consuming, and I was very anxious being in public. I still see the stylist my ex sees, but she's understanding and doesn't bring him up. the restaurant I went to is one of my favorites, but it slipped my mind that 2 of my ex's friends work there, one of which served me. She was too busy to mention him at all.

Major stressors right now:

* I'm 3 weeks behind on my thesis and I have 3 weeks left to have it written and ready to submit to my readers.

* My lease ends in 4 months and I'll have to find a new place to live.

* My unemployment will run out in 2 months, so I have to find a job before then. I want to finish my thesis before I start applying like crazy.

* If all goes well with my thesis, I'll be graduating with my Masters in May. And I don't know what I'm going to do next.

* My divorce isn't final until the end of February, and he attends the same campus as me. So does his girlfriend. I'm absolutely terrified of crossing paths with him and/or her.

Usual coping strategies:

* yoga 2-3 times per week

* relaxation exercises before bed

* setting small goals for daily progress (like, get dressed upon waking)

* adequate &amp; restful sleep

* taking my supplements daily (not currently on medication other than BC, which lessens my mood swings)

* planned social outings with a couple friends at a time (not spontaneous - I always know who, what, when, and where)

So my overall strategy is to focus on my thesis and get that done, but I've been having anxiety attacks every couple nights as I'm going to bed, and I won't get to sleep until 2 or 3am, which has created this cycle of sleeping in and then not being productive that day. I've slept better when my SO stays the night (I don't like to be alone in the house), but I can't ask him to be here every night. Maybe it will all even out once classes start up next week and I can settle into a routine, and the yoga classes at the gym will be more diverse.

I haven't gone to therapy in a couple years because my coping methods typically work, but with the stress of divorce, job loss, and education I think it might be time to see someone. I just took a mental health screening, and it recommended that I get an evaluation for GAD and for Clinical Depression. Even if having the routine helps, I should probably get some help anyway.

Thanks for listening. I guess I just had to tell someone that I'm not okay, and I'm not coping well."

I want to try seeing a therapist again to deal with my anxiety, but I am afraid what I said in session will get out. I know there are confidentiality laws, but I am more worried about subpeonas in case I ever get into a lawsuit or something(example of my worry and anxiety causing my mind to spin).

If I ever have kids or divorced or anything, the last thing I want is my therapist subpeonad and then forced to discuss how I am anxious, fearful and all other negative issues that I tell him.

Can any therapist elaborate on what I can do or what a subpeona would force the therapist to do?"

3 or 4 years back it started that I got claustrophobia, I could not stay long in any crowded or packed places, like train, bus, football stadium etc. I did a therapy and got daily medication (which I still take today). The therapy was one year and ended two years back. I'm actually fine with the claustrophobia issue but damn...these panic-attacks are way too much these days.

It's like up and down..one year back I was almost free of any attacks and now, since some month, they appear to be almost every day. It's not really a strong attack, but it feels like I'm going crazy, loosing my mind..damn, it's hard to describe. I can even feel it physically in my head, how the attack is making me nervous and taking my strength.


I have an ""emergency medication"" for those moments, lorazepam (I think in the US it's compareable with *Ativan* or *Orfidal*) but I can't take that every time I'm feeling striked by a slightly but constant panic-attack.

I'm really wondering what is happening in my body, physically. Like I know I'm most probably not gonna die or ""loosing my mind"" (if that's even possible) but still it bothers me so much...

I don't know, many you guys got some advice or how you dealing with those attacks?"

Had bouts of nausea but nothing too severe and about a couple hour period of intense anxiety. Second day pretty much the same. Yesterday and today have been experiencing intense feelings all day that quite honestly feel like cocaine withdrawal. I've also had terrible headaches which luckily go away with tylenol. Anyway starting to feel like maybe zoloft/meds in general are not for me. Having a tough time concentrating at work is not helping out.
409,0.008541837468534947,0.9914581625314961,0.174,0.707,0.119,"Just a few years ago, after graduating college I had a steady job, great relationships with friends and pretty good relationships with family. Although I didn't love my job and I was a bit shy like I have been my whole life, overall I was happy with my life. I worked out five days a week and lived an active lifestyle.

And then two years ago I went to the ER for a panic attack (well, like many of you can probably relate to I thought I was having a heart attack and a stroke simultaneously but it was a panic attack). The doctor at the ER gave me a prescription for Ativan, told me to take three a day and like the naive person I was back then I did. And then just  three weeks later when my prescription ran out because of a holiday I couldn't refill it I went through a weekend of physical and mental hell as I had unwittingly become addicted to benzodiazepines.

For a long time the fact that the dangers and extreme addictive nature of these drugs was never explained to me made me extremely angry, and there are times when I still get pretty upset about it because if I knew then what I know now I wouldn't have touched that bottle with a ten foot pole, but overall I'm trying to focus on getting better and holding onto that anger is counterproductive as far as that goes.

Anyway, I'm rambling a bit but almost three years later I've gone from Ativan to Xanax to Klonopin which I've currently been on for the better part of a year. I've been prescribed many other medications which had little to no benefit and I've seen several psychologists, social workers and psychiatrists, some better than others but none of whom who could ""fix"" or even really help at all with my declining mental state as the panic, anxiety and depersonalization pretty much took over.

Since that first trip to the ER I've made seemingly tens more when the panic is too much to take, I've been unable to hold onto a job and lately I've been struggling with agoraphobia to the point of sometimes being uncomfortable leaving the house and extremely uncomfortable in social situations with lots of people (something that I've never experienced. I usd to be able to take four hour drives to visit my girlfriend at the time and now driving around the corner has become extremely difficult and driving on highways or in traffic leaves me with full blown panic attacks, whether I'm on klonopin or not. Most days I just want to stay inside but then that just makes me feel worse because I'm not pursuing my goals of starting a career and a family like many of my friends are doing.

My question to those of you who have been where I'm at or are currently in a similiar situation is: how to you find the strength and determination to power through when your symptoms are horribly unpleasant? Any legitimate tips or even personal success stories would be welcome. I'm trying to remember that this will pass but sometimes it's just very easy to get overwhelmed by it all.

Tl;Dr - Anxiety and panic attacks have progressively gotten worse and I find the symptoms so scary and unpleasant that I've started avoiding dealing with them which in the long run just makes them worse. Looking for tips and/or advice from people who have been or are currently in a situation similiar to mine."

2010, I was a calm, content, happy 22 year old guy. One morning, I woke up to this strange ""disconnected"" feeling, felt very spaced out and dreamy, like nothing was real. It was worrisome, but it passed within a day or 2. About a month later, I woke up during the night with this terrible feeling of being on edge, racing heart, racing thoughts, and a feeling I couldn't really describe in my head, kind of like I felt like I was going mad. I couldn't make it stop, so I went to the ER. The nurse there was able to talk to me, and his soothing demeanour put me at ease, but also made me cry a bit. He told me I had anxiety. I couldn't accept it. ""Anxiety doesn't feel like this, I feel like i'm going crazy!"". After a few days, another symptom hit me. Overwhelming depression. Just complete and utter sadness. I would cry at the drop of a dime, for nothing in particular. I was so sad that my old self, my calm and collected self, was no longer. I was mourning myself. A few weeks passed, a few more trips to the ER, and after some blood tests, they told me I was anxious, but they also found out that I had low thyroid hormone, and that I was Hypothyroid. They prescribed me synthroid, and it put my mind at ease, knowing that finally, these meds will help this awful feeling go away. Well, they didn't. 
It's been about 3 years now since my first brush with anxiety, and I am quite a different person. The initial overwhelming ""i'm going crazy"" feeling slowly passed, but this general uneasiness stayed. Presently, this uneasiness appears when there is change in my life, or something with my health comes up. For example, last year, I moved out of my parents' house, and with the change of lifestyle and scenery, and the loss of my ""comfort zone"", I was gripped with pretty bad anxiety, and this ""uneasy"" feeling. This uneasiness I feel is kind of like this feeling of being mentally uncomfortable in my environment. I just recently had to move back in with my mom for a month, and tonight, at dinner, just the lighting, the kitchen table, the kitchen, it all just made me feel uneasy, kinda worried for no reason, and kinda nauseous. I also get really anxious before I travel, because my ""comfort zone"" is far away.
My current state is as follows;
-I feel anxious (uneasy) with change of environment
-I feel anxious when I think about my health, death, and the future.
-I feel anxious with commitment (my new girlfriend)
-My depression has taken a new form. What used to be crippling sadness, has been replaced with apathy, lethargy, lack of emotion, extreme low libido (I hardly even get erections because my libido is low). So basically, I don't feel many emotions, and I don't really ever get horny.
I started taking a natural thyroid hormone, hoping that it would cure my apathy and low libido, but it hasn't really done anything. The dr. tested my testosterone, and I actually score pretty high in that. 

So now, I don't know what to do. My sex drive is dead, my emotions are dead, I feel anxious when im in unfamiliar environments. I also really don't want to go on any SSRI's or anti-anxiety meds.

Help?"

I have anxiety. A lot of it. 

Everyday feels like a struggle, and nights are even worse. at night time, sometimes my throat feels like it starts closing up, that i cant breathe properly, then i start getting chest pains and my arms go weak. i become dizzy and then my neck back and head start to to get sharp pains. I know that these are all symptom of anxiety, and rationally I know its the most likely cause of my physical symptoms, but I sometimes worry that I'm assuming too much, which then causes more anxiety. as soon as anything happens during the day that is remotely emotional... bam. anxiety. if i hear on the news about some horrible accident = anxiety. the list is endless. 

I dont feel like I can talk to anyone anymore about my problems. My mum is tired of hearing my complaints, my brother thinks its simple ""oh why dont you just stop thinking that"". GRR. I even feel like I dont have the support of my boyfriend anymore. Even though he hangs around and says he loves me, I dont feel like I can tell him anything that goes through my head, because he'll get tired of it and leave me. 

I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist, but thanks to the government saying that 'nobody uses 10 psychology sessions per year' I cannot claim anymore from medicare. I am a student and dont have much money, so now my psychology sessions are only when i can afford them. my psychologist has been super nice and lowered her price for me, because she feels I need the sessions. I go to get remedial massages, I try to drink 8 glasses of water daily, I try to do a little bit of exercise (even though this in itself is anxiety provoking, because my heart starts to race and I cant breathe so I think that something is wrong), I do calm breathing exercises, I've tried meditation, but they seem to make me feel even worse, I take rescue remedy drops, I cover myself in lavender and rose essential oils, I dont drink caffine (no coffee, tea, chocolate etc). I feel like I've tried everything. Except medication. 

I could keep ranting, but I'll be lucky if any of you have even made it this far through haha. I know I whinge, but I feel helpless and I dont know what else I can do. 

I welcome comments, just to know I'm not alone here.

413,0.8262488623905073,0.17375113760945396,0.164,0.735,0.1,"Hi all,
Throwaway here as I need some advice but don't want to be recognised due to confidentiality. I work for a charity as a volunteer recruiter. My job generally involves receiving applications from potential volunteers, then organising and undergoing interviews and introducing them into the company. We work on an equal opportunities policy and many people who have chosen to volunteer in the past have had difficulties with disabilities or illness. As such I am very welcoming to people who express that they have had or currently have issues which are preventing them from finding paid work - for example, I have had volunteers in the past with mobility issues, learning difficulties, autism, blind, deaf etc.
Last week I was contacted by an NHS vocational worker on behalf of somebody who would like to volunteer for us. Due to her job's need for confidentiality she did not divulge any information on his condition to me, however the fact that there was an NHS worker involved alerted me that this person probably had some sort of disability. No problem, he can come in for an interview. At the interview, the man was very quiet, a little odd perhaps but isn't everyone? I asked if he had any medical issues I should be aware of and he told me that he had suffered from mental illness a few years ago and had had to go into a psychiatric hospital. He said that he was on medication now and desperately wanted to reintegrate into society. I assumed that this was something like depression, and so was very friendly and told him that everyone deserves a second chance and we do our best to accommodate volunteers regardless of their needs.
The interview went well; before he had become ill he had worked in a skilled profession which would perfectly compliment the voluntary position we were trying to fill. After he completed all the required paperword, I thanked him and the NHS worker, shook their hands, and saw them on their way. I told them that I would be in touch soon to organise his induction and his first day for the charity. A little later in the day, I googled his name. I do this with all our new recruits, out of curiosity if nothing else, and generally just have a look at their social media presence (we once had a volunteer with our vulnerable elderly residents who turned out to have a very controversial twitter account, and so I always have a look online in case there are any alarm bells). The first result that came up when I entered his name was a local news article from 2007. It was accompanied by a photo of him, so I am 100% sure this article was about him. It said that in 2007 when he was 33, he had suffered a paranoid schizophrenic episode, and stabbed his 24 year old wife 27 times in front of their two year old son. She had been in the process of moving out because of his possessive and controlling behaviour, and he murdered her. He was sentenced indefinitely for manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and remanded in a secure mental hospital.
This hit me like a tonne of bricks. I started shaking like a leaf and although its now the next morning, I'm feeling really ill and anxious and panicky. I genuinely don't know what to do; in my personal life if I found that somebody was even remotely domestically abusive then I would distance myself immediately and have nothing to do with them. I had no clue of this man's past, neither he nor the NHS worker told me any of this. I really do not want anything to do with this man. I don't want him to be part of my charity, I don't want to speak to him or interact with him, I genuinely do not feel safe around anybody who has committed such a crime regardless of their diminished responsibility. I have had my own mental health problems in the past, and know many other people with their demons, and I know how horrible it is to be stigmatised because of something you can't control. But where is the line? If I let this person volunteer with us I feel like I am accepting and forgiving his behaviour. His wife is still dead, and his child is almost certainly traumatised or damaged by having witnessed it.
I don't want to stigmatise somebody with a mental illness. But I really don't want to let this man into my workplace. I want nothing to do with him. I do not want to come into contact with him, speak to him, spend time with him. But if he is to volunteer with us, I will be his direct manager. I will be responsible for him. I will have to interact with him. And I really feel legitimately scared - even if he is now on medication and has his illness under control, I still feel that somebody who has committed such a severe crime is a danger to me and to other women.
On top of this, I had no idea when I interviewed him, and I offered him the position. HR has told me that due to equal opportunities we are bound to take him on as a volunteer. Our charity supports the elderly, and the head office is on an estate where we have almost 100 retired people living on site. The position he has applied for is not directly involving the residents, and so in line with our current policy, I told him we would not need to do a criminal records check.
I'm a complete mess over this. I haven't got work again until Monday morning, and it's Friday morning now, but I feel like this is making my own mental health problems increase significantly. I barely slept all last night, I haven't eaten (which is bizarre as I am usually a comfort eater) and I feel sick. I'm shaking, anxious and afraid to leave the house. It's triggered all this shit inside of me and I'm scared that my own anxiety will affect my ability to do the rest of my work. On top of all this, last night we had a large corporate event to raise money for the charity, and I spilled my heart out to a couple of colleagues who I trust, but I'm worried that I was unprofessional to do so and I don't want to get in trouble at work.
This is so long, and I'm sorry if it doesn't make much sense but I genuinely don't know what to do, or if there is anything I can do. I don't know if anybody can give me any advice or comfort but I could really use it."

415,0.01274731869527093,0.9872526813047581,0.137,0.702,0.162,"Hello,

Before I met my girlfriend I had such bad insomnia. I'd get such little sleep most nights and my life just felt like a blur. After panic attacks when I was a kid and the stress my parents caused me I'd cry so many days through middle school and high school. I never felt as ""alive"" as I wanted, just that everything I did was an automatic response.. And my mind would race always, I'd never have a moment of like relaxation. My heart always beat so fast and I constantly felt like I was wasting time or I felt nervous. But when I met my girlfriend. I could finally be myself. I slept so soundly. I felt alive, I appreciated so much more in life. I made all the improvements I wanted and moved past my self image problems and anxiety. I felt so deeply in love and happiness. I looked forward to every day.

Now that I'm in college, and we go to different schools... It's all just come back, all of those problems. And I feel like a robot sometimes, or in a haze, and I'm just not myself. I love her immensely and I can't ever lose her. I want to be a good boyfriend and never mean or an ass but my emotions just make me someone I'm not and I'm trying to get a better hold of them. 

I had tried marijuana awhile before, in high school, without her knowing... I thought she'd think I was cool (I was a naive teenager) but she was so heartbroken when she found out. After I did it once, I felt really great about my life. And not just during the high, after too. It was such a mind opening experience. I realized after getting high a few weeks later, through some introspection that I needed to stop. I had talks with her about it while I was doing to see if she'd think it would be okay. She was sort of negative towards it but I just listened to myself, she had to be okay with it! So, I did it anyway, ""how could she and so many people have such a negative opinion of something so good?"". 

I felt like marijuana clicked with my brain more than most, I was so ecstatic, it felt amazing, unreal. It was almost a religious experience. What?? I thought stoners were just like loser skateboarder/video game playing teenagers who did badly in school. I felt like I had finally reached my potential. The couch locking mind numbing effects? None of that.. My mind was alive. I later found out this was a ""sativa"" strain, which are very stimulating.

Wow, I never knew about any of this. I always wanted to try marijuana, but I never wanted to do it often. I have read so many positive things about it, so I decided to try it. I knew the risk of addiction was relatively low and it was more of a habitual/dependency thing (which I guess is a lot like addiction). But I have good self control, I could go without anything I think.

But now for the one thing I can't go without. My girlfriend. We had never had a single problem, argument, conflict, ANYTHING besides about marijuana. She just had very strong opinions against it, and I really made a huge mistake there, hiding something from her. There's nothing else I'd hide from her, I love her with all my soul. When I went off to college I felt depressed, anxious, almost suicidal. My grades weren't the best. I didn't have many friends, I didn't like what people did on weekends. I got stressed out when my girlfriend went out on weekends, and I wasn't being as good to her as what she deserves. My girlfriend suggested I see the counsellor. I did, and I realized I just have to help myself, but that she (the counsellor) would help me accomplish that.  We made some progress, but after the happy talks I always felt sad a day later. After a month of meetings, my counsellor said I don't seem like I need to meet regularly anymore, and that I was welcome to come back whenever.

Now, I knew people who go on medication for anxiety+derealization/depersonalization+depression but I feel that I hear so much about those medications leaving the taker unfulfilled, with a void in their life. That there are side effects of derealization, depression, suicide, emotional numbing. I'm very emotional and I don't know if that's always a bad thing, I would only want my anxiety and sadness to change. People who use hard drugs to cope with problems never turn out well. And alcohol and tobacco can lead to a lot of mistakes and regrets. 

My girlfriend kind of brought up, ""well if you want to try marijuana again, and be honest about it, that would be okay."" She is so amazing and understanding. I had vowed to never try marijuana again, I loved it but I'd take my girlfriend over it any day. I thought maybe her idea could work, and now that I don't have to hide it from her we won't have any problems.

Well, I tried it again (a different type of it) and it wasn't the same mind blowing experience, but it completely lifted my depression off, and threw away my anxious thoughts. The problem was she was really upset before and after I did it again. And the next few days were great, well.. after the first few hours where she was sort of down about the whole thing. I was never a mean person again, our relationship got along very well, we opened up to each other more and have more intimate talks over long distance. The next weekend rolls around and I figured ""well she's going out with her friends, I'll see if it's okay with her if I try it again."" And it upset her that I brought it up, and we talked for a long time with her being distant, and she said ""it's okay just do it I don't want you to be sad."" And over the week she kept telling me ""it's okay, you can do it, it's you not me"" and I know that she's just saying that, but deep down it upsets her. And I definitely can't allow myself to continue doing it if it upsets her, I just don't want it to upset her.

We've been together for a year, and have a better relationship than anyone we know. We talk about marriage and making it through college together all the time. She's going to try to transfer to my school next year. All of our other friends long distance college relationships have failed but ours. Now, I just don't want to sound like a stoner or loser. I am really on the right path, since I lifted my depression, I rose an F in chemistry to a B+, got A's on my engineering assignments, calculus assignments, English papers. I worked 14 hours on homework on a Saturday! And I did pretty much 12 hours of work every 5 days for the next few weeks. I made 10$/hr online, I gained almost 10lbs of muscle from working out, I finally lifted more than I did when I played football in high school. I made new friends. I had a big appetite for the first time in my life. This was my big rebound from where I was. I rarely had even spent 2 hours on homework in a night of high school, or ever studied for a test, and I was an A student taking AP classes with a high SAT score! I now do a weeks worth of high school homework/studying in a night, if not more. But I liked it! My friends who were off at different and sometimes more prestigious colleges than me tell me they party on weekdays and never do homework. Their parents are so wealthy, millionaires, and they're expected to do the same with success? No way, the generation of hard working parents has led to lazy and unmotivated children. So now I see myself, a once passive good student, now doing better and working way harder than all my friends. It feels great, and me and my girlfriend are working so hard in our classes so that we have a great life ahead of us.

I know marijuana isn't this cure-all magic drug. But it's helped me. And it still upsets my girlfriend whenever we talk about it or I say I want to do it. I tell her every time she's upset I will quit and never do it again, but she doesn't want me to go back to being sad. I know in the end that I have to just help myself, but this has helped me do that and whenever I show her the literature on it or explain how much better I've been doing she gets upset. Every other moment we're not on the topic, life and our relationship is amazing, perfect, but it's on both of our minds all the time now. Is there any way I can make her comfortable with this or find some compromise? Or am I just a druggie and need to drop this little habit and help myself? I want to know what to do, because all of my options just seem like they will cause a lot of conflict. 

Thank you so much for reading. I know this doesn't take the place of a therapist or actual counsellor but it would be nice to hear some opinions."

 I posted here a few weeks ago about my new struggles with anxiety. I knew it was anxiety because both of my parents struggled with it when they were my age and had told me about it. I was having panic attacks at school. Well, I've turned the corner. The first few days at school (college) after my panic attack I spent all day doing my best to fight off new panic attacks (which meant I couldn't talk to people and basically used all of my energy to fight the panic). The real turning point was a day when I had a bunch of tests on the same day. I'm good at tests (always have been),  and they focused me because I had less time to sit quietly and think. Because I was so busy, I literally forgot about my anxiety problems and just did my work. After that, I said to myself ""Well, you got through a whole day without any anxiety, so you should be fine today."" Now, whenever I start to feel panic set in, I say to myself ""no, that doesn't happen anymore."" I know many of you here have much more serious anxiety problems than I did, but when I was at my worst, I thought this was the new normal for me. I thought I would forever struggle with anxiety and that I would never be a ""normal"" person ever again. Here I am, no anxiety, no panic attacks, no medication, just a normal dude. It can and does get better overnight if you don't let it control you. "

She was a nice sweet lady, but I'm the type of person that always remembers to ask the questions days after the appointment as apposed to when she asked me the other day. So I'm hoping some one here can help.

It's my first time being prescribed any sort of medication so I'm a bit skeptical/worried on what to expect.

1. Lexapro (10mg) - so far I've noticed that is just makes me sleepy and very nauseous. It's only been a few days though and I know it takes a while for these to work. What should I do if I forget to take it one day? Take two? Or just skip it? And should I be feeling nauseous/sleepy? 

2. Ativan/Lorazepam (0.5mg) - with these, I feel like they don't do anything. I'll take one before I go out into a situation where I know I'll be anxious, but I'm still anxious. She said these were supposed to be the fast acting ones, but not much has changed. Is this normal? I was looking forward to these for temporary relief till the other ones began working, but now that they're not I'm still just very uncomfortable.

As you may have guessed, I've had some sort of anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember (10+ years), have been in unsuccessful on and off counselling, tried Prozac, Zoloeft, Cipralim, all to no effect. They literally could have been placebos for all the good they did.

On Monday I worked up the guts to go to a doctor, had in a letter I'd written (physically am unable to speak in certain situations) and just walked out with a new prescription. I did some reading online and as it turns out I've been given another SSRI. I'm developing the belief that SSRIs don't work on me. I will still take it though, because I don't see what harm it could do...

Except of course if it has bad interactions with other drugs I use off-label. Mostly illegal stuff that I wouldn't dare tell my doctor about. I've asked people in r/drugs and similar places who assured me I'm gonna be okay, but still.

To clarify, this ain't a case of 'oh I feel like shit for a few weeks'. It's a case of 'If I had the willpower and guts, I would end my own life right now if it wouldn't upset my mother'. That's how we're talking. And the anxiety is debilitating. I have a job but struggle immensely to get through each and every day, and definitely cannot hide any of this from anyone. Wouldn't be too surprised if I had other mental disorders that were never diagnosed  too.

So. Anyone have any notable experiences of Paxil? Especially coming from people who don't find other SSRIs useful? Or is it just a fact that meds can only do so much when my head is full of screwed-up thinking that can't even be changed by understanding logic?"

Occasionally, I will feel kind of euphoric (but still completely rational) which is what they call hypo-mania. About two weeks ago, I was perfectly fine. I went for a walk with my husband after a productive day and amazing dinner with the family. We got back home and sat down to watch Game of Thrones. At one point, there was an overabundance of nudity. Now, I have put on a lot of weight since being depressed and am no where near as attractive as them. I instantly felt depressed and shut down. It was like a light switch. I spent the next week not really communicating, interacting, and crying fits on and off. I had a constant burning in my stomach and tightness in my chest. I instantly felt jealous and completely worthless at the sight of any woman. The thought of my husband looking at porn or naked women sent me into panic attacks with huge 1 hour long crying spells. Things intensified over the next two weeks. Nothing would help, except when I had sex with my husband... somehow that would make it better for a little while. I also had some pretty severe insomnia. 

Things came to a head this past Friday. I woke up just fine. My husband took the day off of work and we were going to watch a movie while our daughter was in school. I started feeling bad right before we left and it progressively worsened. It is like a sinking feeling in my stomach, that turns into a burning, that feels like I can't breath, then the tears start and I feel physical pain. Over the next couple of hours, it got worse and worse. By this point, after 11 days of pure depression and cycling anxiety and panic attacks, I was feeling desperate. I began to fixate on the thought of inflicting pain on myself to release some of the emotional pain (which I haven't done in 15+ years. I was also wishing I could just go to sleep forever so I wouldn't have to feel this way any more. I asked my husband to go to the hospital because I just couldn't take it. I was place on a 5150 (psych hold) over night. It was terrible. I had a panic attack that lasted for the rest of the day, into the night, and until 11am the next day. They gave me ativan which knocked me out for a couple of hours, but everytime I woke up I would be sobbing and not stop until I was knocked out again. I was allowed to go home Saturday afternoon. The psych on call said he didn't think I would benefit from being admitted, nor was I ""bad enough."" He recommended a partial hospitalization... basically treatment M-F from 9am to 3pm or so and then you go home. It is 3-6 weeks. You see a psych once each week, and a therapist 3 times each week. I felt I desperately needed this. 

I should also mention that I can't see my psych until June 8th and that the meds she suggested I adjust over the phone haven't been working. Also, I see a therapist each week, but today will only be my second appointment (I only started to see her once things got bad... shit move on my part, I know) so I don't know how much help that will be.

However, the last day and a half I am better. I still have a low burning in my stomach, but it occasionally goes away. I haven't had a crying fit in about 3 days. I still have insomnia pretty bad though. However, I'm still depressed. Not quite so severe, but I just spend a lot of time in bed. 

Also, because of how it provided me release, I am kind of addicted to sex now. I obsess over it. I am masturbating a ton. It's bad, I know. It just works better than all my pills. I have never been diagnosed with anxiety before, but I have brought it up to my psych. A bunch. And the one before her. I get some bad anxiety, but it has never been *crippeling.* It has affected my day to day life, but has never been like this. My doctors just keep writing the anxiety off as a part of the depression associated with bipolar. However, I am now CERTAIN that I have a separate issue along side the bipolar that MUST be addressed. 

Okay, so now after my ginormous wall of text with my life history, my question is, since I'm feeling a bit better, should I not go through with that intensive therapy? It seems like it might be overkill now, but somehow the weekly therapy and monthly psych visits don't feel like they will be enough. Additionally, ever since Friday, my husband has been seriously babysitting me and staying home from work. Which I am grateful for, but I feel guilty. Especially since I am a bit better. Maybe his constant presence is what makes it better? I don't know. I also feel like I'm just cried out from Friday/Saturday. Emotionally exhausted, if you will. 

What do you think? I'm assuming/hoping many of you will have much more experience and may be able to make a suggestion?"

I’ve come to realize that I have a crippling fear of rejection.  It doesn’t matter by who or what, it gets in the way and makes me lose all ambition to do things.  I don't want to do anything but sleep.  I’ve started to realize this because 9 times out of 10 my weekends are spent sitting at my house by myself. I start by watching Netflix or playing PlayStation but eventually I wind up staring at the wall/ceiling depressed because I want to be out doing something with someone or anyone.  But I’m not.

I have a circle of friends.  I could probably find myself out on the town or at a bar with at least one of them with a few text messages.  But I can’t bring myself to contact anyone because I’m afraid they’ll say no.   It doesn’t matter who it is.  For example, I have two particular friends that I don’t see very often, but when we do wind up seeing each other to work during the day we always make plans to go out that night.  They tell me they want to see me more and they’re a call or text away but *I can’t bring myself to ask them because I’m afraid they’ll say no.*  

I’ve grown to hate weekends because they're always the same thing.  On Friday nights I hope I get to do something with roommates, roommates inevitably leave to go do their own things without me without asking if I want to come along (or there's reasons I don't want to go, like having to third wheel), and I’m left alone in my solitude to wish I was with other people.

Is this a thing I should go talk to someone about?  Should I seek out medical attention and maybe medication?  It’s been happening off and on for about a year now, but more on than off lately.  I have a great job, I'm making money, and all things considered I don't really have reasons to be unhappy and afraid all the time. But I’m really tired of it.  And I'm afraid of what could happen if I try to fix it. :/

I can count on nothing. Since then, I have completely lost control of my anxiety. I cry all the time. I want to cry now, but I've got to get it together for what little bit of work I'm able to do. Every cent counts.

I've been taking more Klonopin than I'm supposed to--sometimes double. Sometimes in the morning (not my usual). I have 2mg a day prescribed, but lately that's become 2.5, then 3, and sometimes 4. A couple of times, it became 2 and a spare Norco I had lying around (prescribed at one point). I understand this is exactly how drug addictions start. And I know I'm physically dependent on Klonopin. I want to stop, but more than I want to stop taking the medicine, I want the ANXIETY to stop. It is running rampant. It feels like I have Restless Leg throughout my entire body. Actually, it feels a lot like Klonopin withdrawal! I have no idea why! I am irritable as hell, unable to tolerate the least bit of difficulty, screaming at inanimate objects...

I see my therapist tomorrow and my psychiatrist Friday, thank God. In the meantime, I don't know what to do. I'm not having panic attacks. I don't feel impending doom or death. I'm not hyperventilating. I'm just struggling so much to hold in the crying. 

Does anyone else know what the hell is happening to me? I'm miserable, especially physically, and it just won't stop."

I've lost two jobs due to depression, and my anxiety is the reason that my internship didn't turn into a job.  I was first diagnosed and put on medication a little over 10 years ago, but I haven't been medicated for approximately 3 years due to lack of health insurance.  I signed up for insurance through my county at the beginning of the year, and was finally able to get an appointment with a new doctor (after going through the circle of calling my old doctor, finding out that they're not covered under the new plan, finding a new doctor, being put on hold, finding out that they're not taking new patients, finding a doctor that takes my insurance *and* is taking new patients, waiting for the new insurance card...).

My first appointment with the new doctor is tomorrow.  It's 5pm, and I've only gotten out of bed to use the restroom and eat something around noon.  I've slept on an off throughout the day (it's my coping mechanism).  I wasn't able to fight through it over the past few weeks to have my records sent from old doc to new one, and now I'm worried that the new doc won't trust me when I tell her what meds to put me on (because I already know what works and what doesn't)."

I was over the moon.

But now that I have the job I'm weighed down by the idea that I'm doing poorly and will be let go any day now. I dread working so much, I've gotten better, my numbers are okay and it's not as hard anymore; yet, I can't shake that feeling of dread and worthlessness.  I put it off and put it off. I've been getting by working in small chunks (I try for 30 minutes, but sometimes I have to break after as little as 5) but I'm barely hitting the minimum hours required, and I'm scared I won't even manage that this week.

And it seems like it's not just work anymore. I spend the whole day with guilt, sleeping more, avoiding and my mood is dropping lower and lower. Completely unrelated goals are starting to seem unreachable. I just feel like I'm sinking into a sand trap and it's getting harder to get through every day.

I've never taken medication for my anxiety before (just therapy for coping mechanisms, it was very helpful overall) but I'm really considering making an appointment for that purpose, because I think my fear of losing this job may just turn into a self-fulfilling prophesy soon.

I(26F) just found this sub-reddit. I really want to get some stuff of my chest that I've been dealing with for a long time. I'm sorry its long, I just need to vent. I dont know if you guys post trigger warnings in this sub-reddit, but I know if I was reading this as an outsider I'd want a warning. I dont want anyone to have a panic attack from reading this.

Here goes. I've had anxiety attacks/anxiety in general since I was a little girl.  When I got into highschool it got worse. A panic attack once a week.  I would go into my parents room crying..Freaking out over something. My parents..didnt really completely understand what was going on and quite frankly after 15 years it was wearing on them. They'd sleepily tell me to go back to bed or unintentionally snap at me( which made the attacks worse because I would freak out over upsetting them). 
My parents at this point took me to the doctors. I was prescribed Zoloft . I should mention I have ADD and was taking medication for that as well. The zoloft made the attacks less frequent, but the attacks themselves much stronger.. (At least thats how it seemed to me). It may have also caused me to have depression..

I met my husband when I was college and things started to get a little better then. He learned very early on that my anxiety was serious issue (he tried to ""scare"" me out of a panic attack once..It didn't end well on his part) and began research/ trying his best to help me during my attacks. Once we were married, the attacks started getting so strong that I would pass out.

We figured out that I needed a routine. My attacks usually happened at night, so he would make me tea/ice cream, get me into pjs, and put on a tv show that i liked. We thought we were doing good.. We even got it to where I only had a panic attack once a month. 

And then we moved. My DH worked from home barely making anything because the city we moved to is expensive. I got a job with a HORRIBLE BOSS. We found out I have poly cycstic ovarian syndrome and was told the chance of me having children was slim to none. It was an awful year. I finally agreed to see a therapist to help me through my anxiety. It was a failure. The therapist basically told me to do what I was already doing. No other advice than ""It sounds like you've already got this down. Keep it up"". 

Once DH got a better job and were doing better financially, I decided that I was sick of taking my meds. So I did the stupid thing and went cold turkey on both of them; at the same time. Once I got over the withdrawals everything was wonderful! It was rare that I had a full blown panic attack and I was able to calm down when I was anxious.  We actually got pregnant and out of the entire pregnancy I only had ONE full blown panic attack. We now have a wonderful little girl..(I also got ""laid off"" from the awful job at 4 months pregnant..Which I was totally happy with) 

Post Partum was when things started to get rough again. I guess I had PPD (post-partim depression) but I was one of those moms that didn't bond completely with LO in the beginning (there were a couple of health issues). We eventually did bond and then I became a typical first time parent.. Checking randomly through the night to make sure she breathing. Calling her doctor on every little thing. (Heck I still will have my husband go check to see if shes breathing and shes 13months). 

The thing is when LO was about 6months was when I had my first full blown panic attack in almost a year. It was a bad bad bad one. Chest tightening, making no sense, nothing could calm me down until I basically passed out. It was not a good time and family drama ensued because of it. (thats another issue for another day).

(TRIGGER WARNING!!!!!TRIGGER WARNING! TRIGGER WARNING!)

Fast forward to  fall last year. I started getting these headaches. I had also started running and trying to get into shape. This also was around the time when Brittany Maynard came out saying she had a brain tumor and that she was going to end her life. I had read an article about how the pain first started as headaches. I immediately went to talk my doctor who said they were just flash headaches. ( I was dehydrated a lot and that can cause small headaches .. Which i had at the time) In march I began experiencing other symptoms. And then fast forward this last week. My headaches have gotten worse and I go see my doctor. She wants me to go get an MRI on my head and neck. I immediately go into panic mode. Thinking about Brittany Maynard and freaking out that I have a tumor. 

The funniest part is that my Doctor is 99% positive I dont have a tumor. I started bawling in her office in front of my child and she tried to assure me that I most likely just have a ruptured or pinched disc in my neck. And its completely plausible. I can feel the pain in my neck all the time.(I have an old car accident injury that never really head properly) She did some physical tests and I passed them with flying colors. She said she would be shocked if I had something wrong. 

I'm still freaking out though. I look at 1% chance of having a tumor and I'm running with it.  I think I have a tumor..I try to distract myself. I pray for calm and peace. I keep telling myself that I passed the physical tests. Nothing calms me down. I have a scheduled MRI in 2 weeks and each day is getting worse. Its to the point where I cant spend time with my husband and daughter. I have to go hide in my bedroom so my daughter doesnt see it. Its wearing down my husband and its wearing me down. There's only so much I can do to distract myself trying to not have an anxiety attack in front of my kid. By the time my husband gets home I'm barely functioning. I'm freaking out over nothing and this anxiety isn't letting me enjoy my daughter or my husband. I hear them playing in the other room while I'm trying my best not to scream from the panic. 

I just dont know what to do any more. Its taking over my life. 

TL:DR Dealing with anxiety all my life. Now I have to get an MRI and freaking out because I dont want to have brain cancer.. Even though my Doctor is 99% sure that its not and thinks its just a pinched disc in my neck."

I was working for a major insurance company and I lost my job due to depression. I ended up getting evicted and moved in temporarily with my grandmother. She is the only member of my family that has ever reliably been there for me. 

As I stayed with her I came to realize that she needed someone to take care of her. I talked with her and asked her if she wanted me to stay with her indefinitely and be her caregiver. After some consideration she agreed that things were becoming difficult for her and it would help her a great deal. After a short period of time her health began to wane. After being a smoker for 40 some odd years she had COPD and CHF, and then was diagnosed with a hereditary problem secondary pulmonary hypertension which affects the lungs. The long and short of it is that my grandmother retains water and requires a heavy dose of diuretics to get rid of the water. About 3 months ago, while in the hospital for one of her numerous stays she began to hallucinate. The doctors determined that the diuretics had taken a toll on her kidneys and she could no longer be ""aggressively treated"" for her water retention problem, and the hallucinations were due to her medication poisoning her. Since her health has been steadily declining and she now is in hospice care, and I'm scared as shit she's going to pass any moment. 

I've done the best I could to take care of her, but the past 3 years have been very difficult. I have had no income at all, and my grandmother only makes about $1500 a month. In the state of michigan, we did not qualify for any programs to receive any financial assistance to provide me with any form of income. We've been able to get by, but barely.

So I'm at a point where I'm watching someone I love die. And all of her children are already divvying up her belongings and getting ready to fight over pathetically small amounts of money. They already let me know that they would rather sell her car and split the money rather than let me have it. Which I don't honestly care about. I don't want to financially gain anything for the loss of my gram. But I'm furious that they would be so petty and wouldn't even wait for her body to be cold before laying claim to my grandmother's belongings. It just makes me sick, she didn't raise them to be like that. On top of that I am walking out of the situation the same way I entered it, broke with no where to go. But the very worst part, the part I can't handle, is the dread of knowing my grandmother can pass at any time. I lived with my grandparents from the ages of 2 to 5, and this was by far the happiest time of my life. I just don't think I'm strong enough to endure anymore. I feel like I am about to collapse.

5. When I have anxiety I can't sleep. :( The kind of anxiety that I am plagued with is mostly depersonalization. For those that have experienced it, it can really fuck things up.

5.5 Me and this girl were acting partners in class and we ended up kissing. She texted me that she had a boyfriend in the navy and that they were doing the long distance thing and that she was sorry. I told her I didn't want to take things farther but I did. We made out. I look on facebook the next day and she's actually engaged. But i wanted to be physically loved in such a fucking bad way I guess i didn't care that she had a boyfriend. I still feel like shit. 

6. I need physical intimacy. This part of me disgusts me. I haven't really had much lately and I need someone to be close with. But getting close to someone and having it not work out is tricky because I will be devastated if I get attached and end up getting hurt. Every time I talk about this with my therapist I cry. So i know this aspect of my life is probably a bigger portion of my problems than I would like to recognize. 

I am considering meds to get me through but I just don't know. If i can't get an erection or achieve orgasm, this in itself will just be another fucking disappointment. But mental hospitals aren't fun. Klonopin is ok when I am really worked up (panic attack) but does nothing for the long run. 

Reddit, I can do such good things. I could be an excellent university student and a caring boyfriend. But the cards I've been dealt almost seem unfair. I just need to make it until July. If I can't sleep, all bets are off.     "

So if you went through that, the story ends with this, they cut him open and then had an ""Oh shit"" moment when they realized it was far worse than the ultrasound showed. That morning we never thought it would be anything worse than a two night stay at the hospital. We ended up with a dead dog. The infection had returned but this time was much closer to his bloodstream, and they couldn't remove it like before without taking out 80% of his colon. No dog can survive that. He was already half of what he should of weighed. 

We couldn't even let him wake up to pay our last goodbyes. They said it would have been far more merciful to euthanize him while he was still under anesthesia otherwise he'd wake up in a lot of pain from the surgery. Worst phone call ever. 

---

It's been almost two days. He died around 3 PM on the fifth. You know, the thing about this dog is, he loved being around everyone. Giant Schnauzers are reserved by nature, but he was definitely less so than most and after he'd made sure you weren't a ""threat"" which consisted of just a second of barking and then a liiiittle bit of sniffing, he would stick to you like wet cement and follow you around everywhere. It was adorable and maybe a bit annoying at times but in the best way possible. He also loved to please people and give them so much love. 

I'm an introvert probably part by nature and part due to my condition. So I preferred a tight circle of small but well-bonded friends, although at times it did get lonely and I was still prone to many moments of severe hopelessness and feeling worthless (still get those, all the goddamn time). He knew, and was always there to be by my side and comfort me. I've long since recanted my faith but at the time I said he was a true gift from God. That he changed my life. He was my best friend and the best dog my family ever had and we've had eight dogs over a period of maybe 25 years. 

He always wanted to be pet. Always made you feel loved and worth something. He was the sweetest boy. And not even three years old when he died. His (very rare variation, I might add) condition was so severe by the time it was finally diagnosed and the full severity of it realized, literally on his deathbed, there would have been no point in trying to keep him alive even if the infection site had been somewhere far less dangerous. He would just have gotten it again and again and again and died to it anyway even if we followed his every single movement and diet intake like an eternal hawk.

---

Since then, I've plunged and hit the grieving process perhaps harder than normal people (however they can actually be referred to...). I didn't cry after the first day, but yesterday I did have a moment where my eyes momentarily filled up in tears during a Skype session with my SO. But... I've all but shut down inside. I don't sleep... I had to take 5mg of melatonin to go with my night pills plus the Xanax I'm weaning off of to even sleep, and then I overslept because of the melatonin and woke up feeling numb and shitty after a dream of my dog being alive and well in the garden. 

I don't talk to anyone. Even conversations with my own two parents tend to be short lived. I comfort my mom and she's been crying far more and harder than everyone else which is distressing... she wants him to be alive so badly as we all do. I've stopped being as open with my (LDR) SO of over 5 months, and we had very open communication before my dog died. I think he thinks he's partially to blame because I don't talk much to him anymore and my replies are often distanced and short. I wish I could work up the energy to write long and heartfelt messages about how that's not true as I usually do, and I didn't mind one bit because I knew it was the right thing to do and I liked doing that, but now... I just feel so dead inside that no emotions are ever truly evoked anymore for maybe more than a moment or two. If he reads this: It's not your fault. At all. I promise you this, always and forever.

I feel like an even emptier husk of my former self. I stopped eating as much and I already ate little before. I feel anxiety creep up on me now more than ever before, and then that crushing and sinking feeling of utter, muted grief and misery non-stop. I keep remembering my mom getting that phone call about him dying and her bursting in tears, red-faced and saying, ""They say Thor isn't going to live!"" like a horrific scene out of a Sarah McLachlan ad, on an endless and nightmarish loop. Again and again. 

I've been up for almost 20 hours and I don't feel tired at all. Bits of my mind would rather I kill myself than let this go on. But the truth is, I never, ever go through with suicide. In fact, I might toy with the thought sometimes but I don't ever plan it out, not one bit. Because... I always want to know whether it'll get better. It got better, when I first got properly diagnosed by a then-new doctor and put on appropriate medication. Then it took another nose dive. Again and again with me failing college and coming home. Then I met my SO. Cue getting better. Then Thor died. Nose dive basically the distance of the summit of Mt Everest to the ground.

I don't know if it'll ever get better, but I'm far too indecisive and inquisitive to let that doubt stop me, oddly enough I let every fucking thing else in my life stop me. I give up a lot and have zero self worth. But I'm still fighting and that's not going to end. 

But it'd sure be a huge help if Thor was healthy and alive. RIP....

My apologies for the awful, ranty wall of text below. 

 Im a college student who has suffered from anxiety in one form or another my entire life. Ive been on meds of ADHD since I was in the 3rd grade and have been to therapy once before for masochism and anxiety. As of about six months ago, my anxiety has steadily increased and I have been having crippling panic attacks. They started small, a natural out cropping of my anxiety and as it has gotten worse they have as well. I was afraid to tell any one, and did my best to deal with it on my own. Of course, soon it was impossible to hide - but I did not admit how bad it had gotten or ask for help until around 1-2 months ago when I had a huge panic attack/breakdown. Since then I have been undergoing CBT. 

My progress has been....slow at best. I am still at school and finishing up my classes. My professors know and for the most part are being very accommodating and understanding. I tend to be afraid of judgment from what I call ""tertiary acquaintances."" Thats just my way of referring to people on the ""fringe"" of my social group, not close (primary) friends, not people with whom I share simmilar interests (secondary) but people further out - close enough to know my name and have a general idea of who I am but not someone you are going to stop and chat with if you pass them on the sidewalk.  I am well aware that they all have far better things to do than judge me, but no one said this was rational. I am fine with complete strangers, its just those people on the edge... 

Because I go to a fairly small school, my world is filled with these people. Its pretty damn terrifying. I cant leave my room without running into one of them. In addition to these tertiary people, I have anxieties associated with places, the fear of ""failing"" (whatever it means for me to fail at that moment), and (possibly) certain times making my entire day a minefield of panic attacks waiting to happen. This has resulted in me missing quite a bit of class, and while two of my professors have been really chill about this my third one - not as much. I cannot blame her for it, when a student misses over half of the classes I would be rather concerned as well. Still - I do all my work outside of class and manage to pull out a's and b's on exams. 

On monday I had a presentation in this class, which I missed because of a panic attack. When I woke up after my initial panic attack and realized what had happened I wound up having a panic attack so bad I was apparently unresponsive for well over half an hour (I don't remember how much time passed)  and the paramedics were called. Seeing as there was little they could do, I did not end up going to the hospital. Unfortunately one of them was not trained to handel panic attacks and other mental breakdowns and told me things like ""Im done playing games"" and ""if you dont communicate with us, we will have to take you to the hospital where you will be responsible for some pretty big bills."" Im sure you can imagine how well that went over. I wanted to run, scream, hide. I was so blindly terrified that I almost attacked the Hall Director who responded to the situation when she approached me even though I have never had a violent (ok, outwardly violent) reaction when panicking. In the end I wound up passing out and waking up in a calmer, although still panicked, state. I then spent the rest of the week coming down from that and recovering - missing my therapy appointment on Tuesday as well as all of my classes. 

That brings us to yesterday, when I had a meeting with my professor. She was sympathetic to what had happened on Monday, but still very insistant that I come to class. 

So, this morning I wake up 2 hours early just to be sure Im ready on time. Everything is going great, Im going to make it. I wont let her or me down today, no sir! Then about thirty minutes before class starts I feel it creeping in...icy fingers pulling at my gut. No, Im going to make it. 20 minutes to go, its getting worse.... 15....even worse...by 10 minutes out (the time I have to leave to make it on time) I was in a full blown (although small) panic attack. Grabbing the first note book I can find, breathing deep, examining my fear (just like my therapist and I had practiced), I walked out the door. Forcing my feet to walk, not run (what will the people Im passing thing? If I start running, will I ever stop?) I make my unsteady way to class. And then sit there for the full period, journaling instead of taking notes, struggling to keep my breath under control, fighting to keep myself in my seat. 

I managed to make it through, but the whole time I felt threatened - not just uncomfortable but legitimately in danger. Then I forced my self to grab lunch, check my mail and *walk* back to my room. 

Part of me is really proud that I managed to do this, to sit in a room I fear, filled with people I fear, at a time thats bad for me. Another part of me snarkily replies that I only did it so I wouldn't have to face a bigger fear, failing. I still havent come down from that panic attack all day. It hasn't gotten any better or any worse. 

Im just siting here on the edge ready to burst - filled with anxious anticipation - fully knowing that it would be better if it just broke. 

So I guess this wall of text is partially a rant, a way to get it all out. But appart from that, I could use any insight or advice you all may have. Have any of you experienced something similar? If so, how have you dealt with it? Do you have any advice for handeling it in the future?

I have a great crew of supporters, but none of them have been there. None of them knows what it feels like, I guess I just hope one of you out there does. 

I dont think I could tl;dr that if I tried. "

That I was having to trick myself to going to work. I can't order my own food, and going to the grocery store just.. the worst thing I could possibly think of. 

As of yesterday, back on therapy, and meds (I hate that I'm on them, but we dicussed that they are for short term.) I ordered my own coffee yesterday. Without having a meltdown and crying for my twin to help me and get me out of the store. I then sat outside and a girl noticed my shirt (Shaun of the Dead) and I talked to her without having a panic attack and made an excuse on leaving.

It's the first time in over a year I have been able to do that. I don't think I'm on that pink cloud, because today I had to drive to a different town to go see a movie and I had to switch with my mother (I feel so childish, because i'm going to be thirty) to take over for me when I started getting in to San Antonio. She promised it was not a big deal, and she was glad to spend time with me. I then ordered my own movie ticket, and picked out my drink without thinking about it for 20 mins. 

It feels like things are finally starting to work for me. I just needed to share, because this sub has helped me a lot. I may not post in here, but I read it and don't feel so alone. :)

I was put on a 20miligram dose of Lexapro, has anyone else here had any success with it, are there any side effects that are uncommon that I should be super aware of? "
438,0.7776282510213596,0.22237174897863762,0.148,0.74,0.113,"About a year ago I sort of found out the hard way that I think I may have an anxiety disorder or something. I am a pretty laid back person, it takes a lot to get me worked up about anything. But a year ago I was going through a lot and one night driving down the highway I ended up experiencing what I think is an anxiety attack? I got pins and needles in my arms and legs, was hyperventilating, my heart was racing, my face felt flushed then more like...numb, I ended up with tunnel vision and there was ringing in my ears. After a little bit of time I ended up feeling dizzy and lightheaded as well. To sort of make it worse, whenever I have anything that effects my breathing my first thought is I'm having an asthma attack. I did not have my inhaler on me due to the fact that I am pretty sure I've basically grown out of all of that (I haven't had an attack in maybe a year or two and the last ones have been so minor) but I started panicking worse not having it. 

I've had maybe 4 or 5 experiences similar to this over the past year (it has been a pretty stressful year). No where near as bad as that one was though. Also, driving does not stress me out at all, it's actually a stress relief of mine; and when I experienced that I pulled off the highway, pulled over to the side of the road, got out of the car, laid down on the sidewalk and tried to calm myself down. The ones since that one have definitely been no where near as bad (pins and needles aren't as bad, face doesn't go numb, tunnel vision isn't as severe), but one thing different is I end up really nauseous and start coughing and dry heaving (while still hyperventilating). 

Is this an anxiety attack? Do people who have anxiety issues always seek medication or are there other ways of dealing with it? Whatever this is definitely effects me, but I haven't sought out professional advice yet just due to the fact that it has never impacted my ability to work or to do well in school. But it does sort of frighten me? The more stress in my life the more I find myself worried that I will end up having an anxiety attack. Oh, and another thing is sometimes when I'm really stressed out I find that sometimes I won't feel too well but nothings wrong, I'll be breathing fine but then inhale sharply. It's sort of involuntary? And it doesn't usually happen once, it happens multiple times over the span of a while but with breaks in between. It's sort of happened a lot prior to me having an anxiety attack so I figured it was worth a mention. Anyway any responses to the questions I asked above would be greatly appreciated.

And... obviously I haven't done a lot of research at all, as I said it takes a lot to work me up enough and that's the only time I really think about it. If I'm not actually super stressed out about something I don't dwell on that at all so I never think to look into it. I only thought to look to see if there was a subreddit for this because I was stressed out and started freaking out a little so after I had calmed down it was still fresh in my mind enough to make me think to look into this. If this does sound like something anxiety-related if anyone has any good reading material I would love to educate myself on this. Thank you in advance! "

It starts like any other anxiety attack. A little nervousness mixed in with a little anxiousness. 
     Then, came the chest tightness and the lack of breath. It feels like my wind pipe is being gently hugged from the inside. My eyes start to go cross-eyed and blur. Everything is a gentle haze as I stumble down the hallway. I am unsure anymore, which way is up and which way is down? I sink to my knees and gasp for breath. Each breath catches in my throat. Too much air is going out and not enough is going in. My heart is singing a tune so loud that it feels like it wants to give up. I sink lower to the ground, my mind racing, trying to....make sense.

*This is just a panic attack, just a panic attack, nothing else, just a panic attack.         
This is just a panic attack, just a panic attack, nothing else, just a panic attack.*

This is my new mantra, as I drag my body off the floor and get up. I have to keep moving. I work my way towards the kitchen to get what my body needs. A glass of water and medicine. I find my way to the sink as my vision starts closing in. Everything is going dark around the edges and the edges are going out of focus. It's like a kaleidoscope without all the colors.
Filling my cup is a lot harder than it should be. My hands are trembling so much, that I have to fill it twice. I successfully open my pill bottle and down two pills. I wish it was like the movies. They have instant relief, as soon as the pills hit their mouth. That isn't the case here. I stumble my way back down the hallway and crawl in bed. Now, I just hope for sleep to over take me and I can rest. There is no need for me to set an alarm. I won't be late. This happens enough, that I have an alarm for that."

I stopped taking it and I've been working through things without drugs for about a year now.  Developed panic in the process, but am still working through it.

I guess I just want to keep my options open.  But given my experience with celexa I'm certain I would never go back to that.

Edit: One thing to note is that a few years ago I took Accutane for about four months.  I had to stop it early because it really messed with me - made me super anxious, panic attacks, and extreme depression.

The second hit went right to my head, I was coughing like crazy and felt light-headed and nauseous. Went to get some water and go to the bathroom, sat down on the couch and then everything went hazy. My entire back, limbs, and neck were pins &amp; needles. I could barely walk, it was hard to concentrate or talk or even open my eyes. I was so dizzy and honestly thought I was going to die. Went to the ER, got some sedative and a few hours later I was fine. But I'm still just frustrated, embarrassed, and confused. I have a meeting with a psychiatrist in a couple days, my first one. My dad pretty much told me ""you shouldn't walk out of that office with some sort of medication"". These anxiety attacks have happened once a week or so for the past few months, weed has triggered the worst of them but they've happened seemingly out of nowhere as well. It sucks because weed was good at calming me down sometimes, plus it's a fun social thing. Ugh. Anyway, a few questions... first, does anyone else have/had similar experiences with weed? This panic attack was miles worse than any other ones I had, which was really confusing. Now I'm scared about what other feelings panic attacks can cause. Second, first psychiatrist visit, what should I expect? If I tell him that a few attacks have arisen due to weed, will that impact an ability to get some sort-of medicine? 

tl;dr: Had a horrible panic attack after two hits off a blunt. Pins and needles feeling all over my back, dizzy, could barely move or feel my limbs, crying, etc. Is this a normal panic attack, it seemed extreme? Also, what should I expect from my first visit with a psychiatrist? Would revealing that weed has caused some (not all) of my panic attacks impact the possibility for some sort of medication?"

I can't go a day without being consumed with fear or doubts. I'm always getting my feeling hurt and always worrying. It's hard to do anything normally anymore and it's destroying my relationship. 

I'm very afraid to take medication. My boyfriend disapproves of it because he doesn't want me to experience any bad-side effects. I'm afraid people will look at my differently if I accept it. I'm afraid some permits will get taken away from me. I'm afraid I might get zapped into a hollow numb person. I don't want to not feel, I just want to stop constantly panicking.

I'm currently an 18-year-old full-time student and I've had anxiety my whole life.  But recently I've discovered that my dad has anxiety too, and even was prescribed medication (my mom made it seem like it wasn't a huge deal) but after a while quit taking it because he ""didn't want to be propped up on it his whole life"". 

Now, as for me, I've been anxious ever since I was a kid. I used to pick my fingers until they bled and nowadays I've moved onto my face which of course triggers some horrible self-worth problems on my part. I also had a few panic attacks back in high school to the point where I was sobbing to my mom trying to explain what was happening/what I was feeling but was unable to put it into words. She told me I was hormonal and kind of wrote it off. 

Anxiety affects me daily, to the point of where I can't wear both headphones in my ears because I'm afraid I'm breathing too loud or I have to assign memories to different tasks, otherwise I think I forgot them. (Ex: ""I remembered to turn off the curling iron because I was listening to this song when it happened, or I said ""Done."" or I pointed at it, etc. etc.) If I don't do this I think about it all day or even call my brother if he's home to go and make sure I actually turned off my curling iron.

Socially it's a bit different, and I think this is the root of why my parents don't think my anxiety is a big deal is because I'm outgoing. I have a lot of friends (God that sounds braggy, sorry) and I'm really involved on my campus. I think they believe the stereotype where if I have anxiety then I must be a loner who just sits in the dark all day. Still, I obsess over day-to-day interactions, I'm constantly afraid that others will find me boring or not good enough to be their friend. I have a phobia of spending the night at someone's house other than mine (although I have done it twice in the past year) and I've only ever had one relationship because I've convinced myself that if someone found all this out about me they would reject me, which would make me feel worse.

So what's the basic gist after this whole long diatribe? Well, basically I'm a little lost. I mean who knows, it could be hormonal teenager-y stuff I could look back and laugh at one day, but I honestly doubt it and I want to be able to talk to someone. The problem is  my parents don't support therapy for me right now. I searched the Free Clinic link and a lot of them in my area were for the homeless. (In the US by the way) Should I call anyways? How do I schedule an appointment? Since I'm still on my parent's insurance, is there a way to pay the co-pay without them knowing I was there? I just need some general guidance I guess. Thanks so much if you read this all the way down. It means a lot to me.

The thought that we're all going to die one day, and we're all just pointless little specks in the universe doomed to be dust for eternity. As an atheist, I wish I could believe something else. I wish I could believe in a God or an afterlife, but it's not something I can just turn on now. It's like a window I've opened that I can't close now.
This has been somewhat of a dark cloud that's followed me around for the last few years (as I've become more aware of atheist ideas and thoughts about mortality). When I was younger I just didn't think about these things....but as I've gotten older (I'm almost 28), I've started to see my entire life in perspective, and my childhood has become a more distant memory, and things in my life and people around me are changing....It's made me consider the big picture of my entire life and who I am....and thoughts about my existence and mortality have become much more intense. It also doesn't help that there are a few things in my life I'm not happy about. I still live at home, I've never had a girlfriend, my career path is somewhat promising but requires a lot more hardwork and has high risk of failure if I don't work really hard and fight for it (which is hard when you think everything is pointless now).
I used to have these thoughts every once in a while, but I'd just push them into the background and carry on with my life. Ignoring this idea of eventual eternal nothingness was all I could do. But in the last couple of months this dark cloud has been looming a bit closer, and the last couple of days it has come full force and I can't ignore it anymore. It won't go away. I basically had an anxiety attack yesterday. The more I thought about how pointless everything is, the more I saw there's nothing I can do. I actually vomited twice from the anxiety and inability to do anything about it. I'm trembling and have no appetite...and I may vomit up anything I eat again.
I try to carry on with my life and continue ignoring it...but it's very difficult without a big distraction, and anything that does distract me is just momentary until the thoughts resurface. I look around at my friends and family, and see them living their lives, blissfully ignorant, ignoring the fact, and I can't do it. I'm trying to focus on my goals and things I want to do with my life, but I'm having trouble giving a shit cuz I know it's all pointless. Everything I see around me is completely pointless. I can't find the motivation to care about anything now.
I don't want to kill myself, mainly because that would devastate my friends and family, but also I don't really want to do something that crazy....it also doesn't really solve anything except make the thoughts stop...and then I wouldn't be around to enjoy that feeling.
I've read other similar posts on here, and there aren't really any solutions to this problem. Nothing anyone says to me can make it better because the truth still remains. And that's what's so terrifying about this. I've tried watching Alan Watts videos or look up other peoples' advice, but nothing really helps.
I'm kind of scared to talk to my family or friends about it because they all think I'm a pretty well adjusted, happy person....and I don't want to blind side them with something crazy like this and freak them out......I feel like I need to go to a therapist and maybe get medication or something. But I don't know if there's any medication to deal with this kind of thing....and I really don't like the idea of medication but I'm not sure what else I can do."

I went to the doctor today to see if I could get help with anxiety and the panic attacks I've been having lately. I talked to the doctor about my past anxiety issues - I've always been a very anxious, high strung person. I was on Lexapro at one point for anxiety, but it played up the depression that I also struggle with and made it very hard for me to get out of bed a lot of days. Truthfully, I was in a much worse place mentally when I was taking that medication. Besides anxiety and panic attacks on a weekly basis, I'm really very happy.

Regardless, her opinion was that I'm having panic attacks too frequently to not do anything about it. She proscribed me Wellbutrin, but after doing some research, I'm worried about it. I've heard that it will increase anxiety... and that's the exact opposite of what I need right now. Of course, that makes me anxious (yay!). I'm relatively certain the reason she chose Wellbutrin was because of the problems I had with Lexapro in the past, but still. Any tips and tricks for taking this stuff? Reassurance that its okay to give meds a try? My SO is quite skeptical. I'm quite skeptical. I don't plan on being on the meds for an extended period, just until I can get into some counseling and get things under control, until I learn to deal with my anxiety.

It was also really embarrassing once I realized all of those people were helping me with something that was not a life-threatening emergency in the way I had first perceived.

I was having such terrible anxiety at work and I started bringing up the bad things in our relationship and she started thinking the same. I had started taking medication weeks before this and it has completely made my thinking worse, and how I feel about things. I flushed them down the toilet, and told my doctor I'm not taking anymore.

But we broke up, and she asked for space. I panicked every single day and ended up texting her to remind her this isn't me, and it's the medicine that she even wanted me to take to help myself. This made her grow farther away from me and she ended up blocking me on everything. I had an abusive ex before her, and she blocked me in the end to hurt me more and my recent gf told me she would never block me. She said she had to do it until she got over me. We literally wanted to get married. 

Now she's sitting on tumblr everyday, knowing I use it every single day and you can't block people. She posts things that get my hopes up, and some things they make me feel bad, because I know she reblogs what she's feeling. 

Example today she reblogged: 
“Ten Steps on Loving a Girl with Anxiety:  Step 1. Her fears are very much real to her, never say that they aren’t.  Step 2. Don’t tell her to think positive, because sometimes she can only think of the worst possibility that could happen.  Step 3. Never tell her that she’s “overreacting” during an attack, because the anxiety gives her no other choice.  Step 4. Face to face confrontation isn’t always the best idea. If she doesn’t want to meet up, leave her be and don’t get mad.  Step 5. Don’t ever, EVER, tell her that you understand how she feels, because odds are, you don’t.  Step 6. Blaming her for having anxiety is never okay, no matter how mad you are or even if you don’t mean it. She didn’t choose to be this way.  Step 7. Don’t leave her alone because if you do, all she’s left with are her thoughts.  Step 8. Tell her things are going to be okay, because even though it’s not always true, it’ll give her some hope.  Step 9. Don’t make her confront her fears if she doesn’t want to. Sometimes it’s only going to make it worse.  Step 10. Love her. Love everything about her, especially her bad side. Because sometimes all she needs is for you to hold her hand and make her feel like she is worth more than her disorder, because she is.”

And I don't understand.. I had one freak out that day and she's not forgiving me. I apologized so many times because I couldn't lose the one girl I've loved more than any other person.  

I don't know what she is thinking, she's sending mixed views because she knows I follow her. I'm having anxiety so much because I can't call or text cause she blocked me. 
But she has replied with anger, such anger towards me and I don't understand. I have done everything for her, and now apparently I'm toxic? After a very few amount of times of me having anxiety. 

I'm praying everyday, but I feel like I'm waiting and I don't know how to not wait. And she's in college 2 hours away where I'll be going close to next semester, and she comes home Tuesday so idk if she will even see me she said she wouldn't. "

This is my first post here, i really don't know where to start or anything. I'm expecting this to be really long but then again i don't know.
I'm guess a little about me would be a good start, then some information about how i feel and about things that have happened that could be causing my anxiety.

before i start i just want to say that i'm not hugely educated about anxiety, which is kind of why i'm here, to look for a better understanding of everything i'm feeling. So i just want everyone to know that i'm not trying or meaning to offend anyone with anything i say.

Okay here goes.

My name is Luke and i'm currently 19 and at a uk college studying a video games design course, in September I'll be heading off to university to study Animation. I work part time at a fast food restaurant, i love listening to music and playing video games.

I guess i can say I've always been very anxious, but it never seemed to cause me any problems that i would notice in a big way, if you understand what i mean?
High school i was fairly popular i guess, even though my school was small. I didn't consider myself as part of a specific group of people that would constantly hangout together. I would always walk around and talk with friends that were with different groups, i got on with pretty much everyone. When i left high school i was dating a girl for a few months, we both went to the same Sixth Form/VI Form (a college/school to study A levels for anyone that doesn't know). At first i really liked the girl but as the first year of VI form went on we grew apart because i didn't really try. We broke up and i was a lot happier but i can still picture her words in my head. She told me that i just didn't care, never did anything and never tried any more.

That really hit me hard and it still does now 2 and a half years on. I ended up dropping out of VI form and going to a standard college to study Video games design that I'm now in the last month of. I spent 2 years working my socks off and now i have a place at university, which is great. 
 
But...

those 2 years were extremely lonely, yeah sure i got on with college mates but i really was lonely. I didn't make an effort to meet anyone because i felt better alone. 
December 2014 my parents separated, my Mother left my Father for another women, i won't go into details because i don't want to but this is obviously a huge change, i haven't felt the same since it happened to be honest, at first i just drunk it off. I turned 18 in January 2014 and over the Christmas break in 2014 from college i was out most nights just drinking with friends. 

But i would always, always shy away from talking to girls, even eye contact would be awkward for me, like they were judging me, everyone was judging me. I met one girl who'd previously gone to my high school but transferred to another, if she never spoke to me though nothing would have happened at all. She was attractive but honestly i didn't feel that there was a relationship there. We met a few times but nothing really went anywhere.

Then one night after work i wasn't going to go out because i love cancelling plans last minute but in this instance i was dragged out by my Closest friend. He met his girlfriend in a club and she had a friend that i'd never met before with her. 

Now i'm going to be as honest as possible here but this girl was just....wow, i didn't even have to ask her anything i just knew that i would like her, i'm talking past the looks, i kinda just knew i would like her personality and everything. I really struggled to speak to her though, like my friend and his girlfriend just left us alone in order for me to talk to her. But i thank them for that i guess.

I ended up being in a relationship with her for a few months, i adored everything about her, we shared music taste, films and just loved spending time with each other. 

I became extremely clingy and it made her uncomfortable and i pushed her away more than anything, i kept wondering if i was trying hard enough or if i was doing things right or wrong. I constantly worried about everything to do with the relationship. 
We're currently not together but we're still as close, having her tell me we're not together is like someone tying a weight to my heart, it feels heavy and my stomach turns up and twists. 

I've recently been struggling to eat meals properly without feeling sick/nauseated halfway through, my stomach turns in knots constantly when i think about losing her, things she said like above and the thought of her being with someone else.

I constantly feel like i'm not good enough, i shake and shiver more frequently and i bite my finger nails way more than i did before. It has always been a pet habit but now it's much worse. 
I have no one to speak to this about, my dad worries about me but i won't talk to him about anything because he's very one track minded. He doesn't realise it but he's very naturally against mental illness or medicine/tablets such as anti-depressants, it's just kinda of sub-conscious. My mum doesn't live with me and it's still hard talking to her anyway. Like i will cry most times i even think about mum. But then again i cry a lot about the girl i've been with.

I've been told that i'm maybe replacing my mum with the girl i've been in a relationship with but i don't think that's true as i know i wouldn't be in a relationship with her if i genuinely didn't like her, that's just unfair. 

It genuinely hurts me and that just makes me spin scenarios in my head and get a lot of thoughts about what if i did this different, what if i do that, what if she thinks this, what if she means that, what if she doesn't like me at all.

I know recently i've just been annoying her, i tell her a lot about how i feel, i know she still cares and likes me but i say everything wrong and that makes me worry about whether i should say anything at all.

I don't really know what else to say

I would really appreciate piece's of advice or just any thoughts in general. I'm seeing a doctor about it soon, i'm not on any medication currently and whether i need to be i don't know at all. I'm speaking to a college advisor about it in confidence, she's signalled that i could possibly develop an eating disorder.
I've not looked into detail about meditation or other self help techniques but any suggestions are welcomed
I really don't know

Anyone that's got this far i'd like to thank you for listening, i know really it's just a teenage love story somewhat but my feelings are all over the place, rapid mood swings from happy to sad and vice versa. 

Anyway i guess i'm going to just leave it here.

Thank you for listening, it means a lot

Luke

EDIT: - I've never suffered a panic attack, however i do have a lot of nightmares about things such as losing her and not being good enough. I wake up heavy breathing and sweaty, sometimes the same feelings as the nightmares come up just before sleep, i just run tonnes of scenarios through my head"

Looking back on things, I've had anxiety for the longest time but it didn't become a problem until last year (senior year of college). I failed a big chunk of my final semester and had to repeat it in the fall. My self esteem was destroyed after that and I don't think it's gotten any better. A few weeks later, I got into a bad car accident that the police said was my fault. My insurance company proved it wasn't my fault, but it gave me a new fear of driving and being blamed for things.

Almost a year later, I don't think my anxiety has gotten better. I see a therapist once a week and I like just talking him because I'm worried about burdening my family/friends. That helps a lot but I still feel terrible. I got a new job in my field and I'm too scared to make phone calls for it because I can't break the mindset that I am a fraud and I don't deserve this at all. I'm also getting to the point where I'm too afraid to make plans with friends because I don't know how they'll react or if they'll be busy and I'll look like an idiot. Those are the thoughts that keep me up at night.

Today my mom yelled at me about all of that and now I just feel fucking terrible. I don't want to go into my job (which I hate) today- I just want to be alone and cry. When my mom was home, she was screaming at me when I was crying and yelling at me as if this was my fault. This is the last thing I'd want to inflict on my loved ones. I hate this anxious part of myself. It brings out the worst characteristics of myself. I just feel so alone because I don't have a huge support system here like I did in college and I feel like my mom is getting frustrated with me and wants to put me on social security.

I'm thinking now medication might be the next step. I'm at the point where my anxiety is crippling me from doing what I want to do in my career, socially and mentally. I'm going to my therapist tomorrow and I'm going to talk to him about all of this (I actually wrote a note in my iPhone so I'd remember how I felt when this was happening) but I just feel like everything is my fault. I hate feeling like I'm the worst when I know I'm not that bad. I want to go back to the more carefree version of myself where I wasn't worried about money, getting a job or anything else.

I don't really know if I'm seeking advice on medication or if I just need to vent but I'm not in a good place today. This sucks so much."

The earliest I could remember was the persistent fear of getting kidnapped, and things of the like. Later, going into 7th grade I got hit with this massive fear of being buried alive to the point where I would cry daily and couldn't eat or sleep. I would later get hit with several other anxiety spells, the most recent extreme one being a fear of hell over the course of a good chunk of 2013.
Recently I started talking with a guy who lives half way across the country, which was one of my first very serious guys who i had ever talked with. Recently he told me how he needed some time to himself, so I've been extremely anxious because out of nowhere he stopped talking to me. I was scared he was going to forget about me, even though he never actually would because of how great friends we were. He told me that if he doesn't respond to my messages that it's because he's really bad at responding to stuff, and that sometimes he doesn't see my messages. I would ask to facetime him, and he normally would until this past week when he stopped responding (this was when out of nowhere he needed time to himself). I found out that the idea of just being his friend and being okay with that was enough to pacify my anxiety, because I need to be okay with myself before I can be in a relationship with anyone else (as has always been my mantra). But last night he messaged me briefly, but stopped responding in mid conversation, while I saw him tweeting. My anxiety kept me awake a good part of the night, to where I kept waking up, and couldn't calm myself. I was thinking to myself, ""where did all of this come from? Just hours ago I was doing fine because of my friendship with him, and now this."" My point for this is, I think it's more so a neurophysiological response from my brain as opposed to it actually being me. My friends keep telling me that I'm overreacting, but I can't control this anxiety. As we all know, if I could just make it stop on a whim, I would. Is there any way I can stop MASSIVE anxiety like this without having to resort to pharmaceuticals? I don't like having to use medication because I think the cons outweigh the pros. Any advice?

When I was about 8, I threw up in a store, I hated it, I had no where to go, I felt gross and like everyone hated me because of it. Because of that I didn't go anywhere for months (I was homeschooled so it was really quite easy to avoid my fears) because of the fear of being sick. 
The fear of that faded again after about 9 or 10 once my parents forced to face the world and go grocery shopping.

I have a very supportive family and boyfriend, all who have suffered anxiety like me, I am so lucky to have them.

I've tried everything so far except medication, I'm sick of wanting to stay home, not spending time with friends, my poor boyfriend basically has to beg for even a kiss because I just feel like shit. I want to eat again, a big giant piece of cake and not worry about throwing it up.

I'm not particularly sure what type of anxiety I have but it's mainly based around obligation and decision making. I currently do not take medicine to control anxiety as I have not had much success with medications. I do undergo therapy which is quite helpful.)

I was wondering if anyone else had a similar issue with sleeping/ falling asleep? This has been going on consistently through therapy and various anxiety medications for essentially as long as I can remember. 

I have issues falling asleep at night. I imagine the behavior at the core of it is having some sort of obligation the next day (school, work, house sitting, &amp;c) that I'm really not looking forward to. As a result I can't seem to allow myself to relax because I know that activity will happen right after I wake up, and I feel like I will have to partake in it sooner perception-wise. 

This minor stress fueled behavior turned into an anxiety driven behavior, that has since spread to nights where I do not have obligations the next day. Such as right now, I don't work for too days, but I feel stressed about this obligation, and it is effecting my ability to settle down. 

It has essentially become this weird thing that happens every night when I settle down, and it is dark outside, where I'm too anxious about the time in between obligations that I'm ""wasting"" sleeping to allow myself to relax enough to sleep. The problem is not prominent/non-existent during the day when I sleep or nap regardless of obligation.

On a similar note, if I know I need to be in bed asleep by a certain time, I have trouble getting to bed as well as falling asleep once I'm there. I know I'm doing it, but it's almost a compulsion at this point. I can't seem to stop myself from stretching the time before bed out as far as possible. That anxiety starts creeping up on me and then I feel like the stress is just radiating through my body, and I feel restless. I used to find that exercise helps, but my worsening health has made exercise more difficult, and painful, so I've since had to limit what I can do. 

I've been doing this about as long as I can remember, which admittedly is not that far back anymore. I was wondering if anyone had similar issues? How have you personally been able to relax, or lessen this sort of pending doom type of anxiety. I've been able to work through the majority of my anxiety through therapy, but this particular problem seems to be lingering. I was hoping some of my fellow redditors might have some techniques I can explore."

I used to suffer from panic attacks every now and again. Mainly whenever I knew I had to go somewhere and there would be a lot of people or in school when we had to do presentations and I would have to explain to my teacher why I didn't have mine.

Around late October/early November, I started getting more of them. And since around mid November they've picked up to roughly one every day or at least 5-6 times a week. The symptoms have also gotten a lot worse. Before it was just an anxious/scared feeling with some slight shaking and slight chest pain that lasted for maybe 15-20 minutes. Recently it's gotten to where I have the anxious/scared feeling, with moderate chest pain and shaking, what feels like I'm having a hot flash and start sweating, and nausea. It's also lasting for almost an hour. The first 30-40 minutes includes all of these symptoms and then most of them go away except for the nausea, the general anxious feeling and the shaking. 

I was just wondering if anyone had any tips on how to make them more bearable? They're a huge inconvenience and I have no idea what to do.

I also plan on maybe getting medication sometime early next year if it continues. I was curious if anyone has gotten medication for it and if it's helpful. I'm also wondering how exactly you go about getting a doctor to prescribe it to you?

Thanks for any advice! "

The first time I ever had a panic attack was after I had smoked weed with my sister and some of her friends- it was like an acid trip. Ever since that, I haven't felt the same (I'm sure it's a mental thing). Anyhow, high school was completely terrible for me- I hardly ever was able to go because my anxiety became so debilitating for me. I was started on SSRIs when I was 16. My GP started me on Zoloft, which made my mind feel cloudy and made me prone to forgetfulness. I then switched to Prozac when I was about 16 or 17. I also tried seeing a therapist, who after about 2 sessions basically began to send me away after about 20 minutes, claiming that there was nothing else to talk about during the session. I ended up leaving that therapist after about 3 or 4 sessions- it was worthless, she didn't think I needed the help I was looking for. The Prozac made me feel drowsy and zombie-like but I stayed on that until the age of 19. At the age of 19 I was then put on Lexapro by my GP, then began seeing a psychiatrist soon after who continued me on the same meds. I began seeing a therapist, in addition to the psychiatrist, and she has me doing CBT. She diagnosed me with General Anxiety and Social Anxiety; she also mentioned that I seem to have OCD tendencies, but not full-blown OCD. We have worked on relaxation training and thought stopping. We talk about my anxieties and possible triggers; she has me keep a journal to keep track of my anxiety. Right now my ""homework"" is planning out my homework and assignments so that I am not constantly doing homework or doing it in large blocks. (Note: I freak out about school. I like to put my 110% into it. I will sit at my desk in my bedroom and do unnecessary school work for more than 5 hours at a time without a break. I don't know how I find the focus.)

So, long story short, I want to get off of SSRIs and all medication. I will not be able to take SSRIs for the rest of my life, and they will certainly not solve my problems. I need to fix my anxieties from within. I am looking to make myself a lifestyle plan. I would appreciate any suggestions. I read a few and came up with some on my own already:
  

 Diet: 
        eat a balanced diet, focus on omega 3s and probiotics.       
        Eliminate coffee (replace with tea). 
 

Incorporate Exercise: 
        I am a huge proponent of yoga. I have been practicing since I  
        was 16 years old and just got back into it recently in a huge 
        way. I find that it calms my mind, makes me 
        happy, allows me to focus, and helps me feel good about myself.
        I have recently begun going to the rockwall at my university just 
        about weekly. Its a good exercise and is definitely something I 
        have to work at- I think I'll keep up with it! 
        I plan to begin running for my cardio once the weather gets  
        nicer. I have read that cardio is awesome for anxiety because it 
        gets you used to the somatic symptoms (rapid heart beat, loss 
        of breath, sweating, shaking, etc.).
   


 Meditation:
        Just as I have been doing yoga since 16, I have been practicing  
        meditation for about as long. Meditation fell out of my practice 
        further than yoga did, so I have to redefine and reconfigure my  
        practice, but I find this to be very important to my recovery and 
        happiness in life. 
     


 Stop avoiding anxiety-inducing situations and stop reacting  
           to my anxiety:
        I am very nervous in a social situation generally, such as 
        speaking in front of a group. I would typically avoid this, through 
        dropping classes that required such activity. I am no longer going 
        to do this, I am going to push myself to try my best when this 
        situation comes around again. In fact, this semester I am in 
        multiple classes which require that I speak in front of my 
        classmates. In my writing class, we are writing memoirs and 
        personal essays. We read these writings aloud to our classmates 
        so that they can critique them, and I have fortunately become 
        okay with this. In the beginning, it caused anxiety to the point 
        that I would consider turning around to go back home on the 
        way to class so that I could get online and drop the class. Now, 
        I am so glad that I did not do this- I am succeeding! 

        A lot of symptoms get a stronger reaction out of me, for example   
        the spatial deformity which I experience. Sometimes, in an 
        especially anxiety-provoking situation, my spatial skills seem to 
        leave me. I reach too far out to grab things that are right in front 
        of me, I cannot tell where things are. In essence, I lose some 
        spatial recognition. This is especially problematic when I am 
        driving. When this happens, I worry more that I am going crazy or    
        that something is wrong with my brain. I need to train myself to    
        quit this.

Sorry for the long post, Reddit. I hope you have some suggestions, though. I am desperately yearning to help myself be a happier, stronger me :) "

I tried *so many times* to meditate over so many years…but it was so difficult and it never got easier to do, even though when I was doing it regularly there *were* clear benefits to my mental health.

I used to hang with a yoga/meditation-type crowd and *everyone* had awesome daily practices. When I’d talk to them about my difficulty meditating I got patronizing responses like “it’s difficult for *everyone* you just have to keep doing it until it gets easier” [sub-context, have the will-power I did and someday you will be as awesome as me].

I felt really, really bad about myself. Here is something that clearly would help me…that everyone else I know can do…and somehow I just couldn’t do it. 

A few weeks ago I started taking medication for anxiety/depression. The first time I sat down to meditate after the medication started to kick in I was amazed…at how *freaking easy* meditation is now. I can’t believe I thought everyone was so much “better” than me for being able to do this…if it was always *this easy* for them…I can’t believe everyone (including myself) thought I was *that* unable to sit with myself when most (although not all, of course) of the difficulties came from a chemical imbalance.

I guess what I’m saying is…if you are someone who is able to meditate regularly, I tip my hat to you, and I hope that it helps you in whatever ways that you need.

…If you are someone who struggles with meditation, please don’t feel bad about yourself. It really is way easier for other people.

I also wanted to throw in some other stuff about teas that I have found to be effective. I am going to try to make this as short but detailed as possible. 

So a little over a month ago I decided to try out Passionflower and see if it worked for me and my anxiety. I decided to do this based on information from other reddit suggestions in the past and random reading I had been doing. It seemed to have at least some scientific basis for its anxiety-reducing benefits. 

Source: [Study] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11679026

Anyway I bought these: [Amazon]http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Answer-Passionflower-Standardized-60-Count/dp/B000I48M3A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335225158&amp;sr=8-1

and took them as directed, 2 capsules a day. I took one in the morning (when my anxiety is the worst) and one mid-day. I don't know if it was a placebo effet or if it did in fact work. All I can say is it definetly FELT like it worked. I had almost the exact same feeling as Xanax minus the drunk-like feeling and not near as much drowsiness. I am only on .5mg of Xanax as needed though, and have only taken it 2 times in the last 4 months, just an FYI. 

Any day I woke up anxious during this last month I would take a capsule and it seemed to work everytime. If it didn't completely eliminate my anxiety, it made it very manageable. Of course I still keep a spare Xanax in my wallet in case I ever get a terrible panic attack. Passionflower just worked wonderfully for me.

During this same time, I started to experiment with teas. My mom is a HUGE tea drinker and has buttloads of different teas at her house. She was showing me some that had been recommended to her a long time ago when she was suffering from anxiety/depression too. 

It was these in particular: 

[Mix Blossoms Tea]http://www.botanic-art.com/anahuac-blossoms-bags-pi-224.html

[7 Blossoms Tea]http://www.mexicanimports.us/images/thumbs/0000345_300.jpeg

After looking at both of them, I kind of said, ""Wow no wonder"". BOTH teas have Passionflower in them and the mixed blossoms tea has Valerian Root, another scientfically proven herb to reduce anxiety. I was lucky enough to find more at local hispanic stores.

I combined this with my now routine, twice daily, Passionflower pills and WOW. I sleep like a freaking baby now. I'll drink a tea 30mins-1hr before bed an it knocks me out. I get such a good nights sleep without feeling anxious during the time it takes me to actually fall asleep.  

So to recap my routine goes like this: 

*1 Passionflower Capsule in the morning if I feel anxious.
*Another one mid-day. 
*Either one of these teas before bed. 

I highly suggest giving this or something like this a shot if you are a new anxiety sufferer (like me) and don't know in which direction to go yet. IE: Medication, CBT, or both. Or maybe you want to try to fight off anxiety yourself and need something asap. I personally want to get rid of my anxiety ASAP (or make it more mangeable) thus I am starting CBT next friday and will continue to do this routine to help facilitate the whole process. If needed though I will incorporate actual anxiety meds but im currently optimistic that Passionflower and CBT will help me overcome anxiety. 

**NEEDLESS TO SAY**, DO NOT take with any other anxiety meds without talking to your doctor first. I haven't taken my Xanax once since starting with the Passionflower since I have not had a chance to ask our family doctor yet. That and also because I haven't needed it =D. 

Good luck everyone! "

I actually went through something really traumatic 14 years ago and to make a long story short I had this nervous energy for two years, always looking over my shoulder until the situation was put to bed. I was fine and everything seemed to go back to normal until I got into a car accident 6 years ago. I couldn't sleep, I was constantly thinking about the accident and what could've happened.I woke up one morning and as I lifted my head up, everything kind of went white and my head was extremely fuzzy. Like a a ton of bee's were stuck in my head. I had rapid heart beat and premature heart beats as well. It totally freaked me out. I didn't go to the doctor right away but my thoughts consumed me and at that time I didn't know how to control the anxiety I just let it consume me and let it take me down a dark place in my head. I went to see a chiropractor from accident and told him about my symptoms hoping for anyone to tell me what I want to hear. From there I saw another doctor because I was then starting to have this off balanced feeling, like when you pull out from a parked position and the car next to you pulls in, that sensation of movement but you're not moving. She did some simple tests on me to rule out further testing for brain MRI's as I thought I had brain cancer/tumor but this one doctor could feel my worry and concern and instead of prescribing me medication (as all docs before her did), she told me to buy this book that only cost me $3.49 from amazon. It was written in the 70's and it was seriously a life savor. I called it my bible for anxiety. After I started to train myself to let the anxiety happen and not dive into it, I started to feel so much better and could go on with life, BUT....This situation that happened 14 years ago has resurfaced and what I've heard is if something really traumatic happens, even if you're over it, all the feelings and emotions flood back as if it's happening for the first time. Just two weeks ago I started to feel off balanced again, nausea but no vomitting, can't fall asleep, consuming thoughts and this weird sensation in or on my head. The best way to explain it is, it feels like, I can feel my hair growing, it's this weird buzz, chills kind of feeling and of course I let myself go online and start looking up brain cancer and oh my goodness the list goes on. I guess my question to anyone who might understand is, does anyone else have these weird sensations accompanied with anxiety? I'm starting to really freak myself out again and allow myself to go down this ugly road. perhaps I should bust out my book again? Just hoping for some clarity so I'm not running around like a crazy person again scheduling multiple doctors appointments. Thank you!"

So has anyone else had any issues with their throat and anxiety? For a couple of years I've had a real tight feeling in my throat, kind of like its being gripped - as well as that 'lump in the throat' feeling. When it first started I also had occasional vomiting. I have had weeks where its not been an issue but when it is there it is 24/7 except for in the mornings sometimes. I also have frequent light headedness and some interesting trips to the toilet.

I've had all kinds of tests such as barium swallows and endoscopies in order to ensure there is nothing physical. Nothing was found and the doctors said it must be 'globus' caused by stress and anxiety. I had a few weeks of CBT but the group format really didn't work for me so I bowed out.

My emotions can often be somewhat unstable, I become easily agitated or upset at times and often cry for no reason in private. Also have some real issues concentrating at work sometimes which in turn leads to more stress and anxiety.

Had a very stressful 2013/14 and have been smoking weed heavily for a few years now. No matter how many tests I have I manage to convince myself that there's a legitimate health issue that has gone undiscovered. I suppose the initial physical symptoms of the anxiety could have frightened me so much that it developed into full blown health anxiety.

Anyway - can anyone out there relate and put my mind at ease a little bit? My wife doesn't really get it and I don't blame her for that, she is as supportive as she can be. Doctors mentioned medication but I don't want to become reliant on a drug to regulate my mood (I know I smoke weed already but I'm gradually cutting this down).

This bus was full of acquaintances and then just my one friend and I. (the two others stayed behind.) Anyhow as soon as the bus doors closed, I started to feel nauseous, like I had diarrhea coming on. I toughed it out but seriously considered jumping off the bus. Long story short I made it with some coaching from my friend. When I got back to my room I ran to the bathroom, but there was no diarrhea, actually nothing happened, I just felt relief. Since then, I have had anxiety for the last 10 or so years, with a break in the middle of about 4 years. 

How does this affect me? Well it makes it tough for me to walk across the street (about 1/2 mile R/T) with work colleagues for lunch. I rarely ride in someone elses car, unless I feel absolutely comfortable with them, like I could ask them to pull over and I could poop by their car and they wouldnt judge me. Airplanes are terrible for me. The whole sitting while waiting to take off, and the sitting while it taxi's to the terminal. I go out of my way to look for non-stop flights, even international. Overall I just get really strong feelings of uneasyness. I can deal with the stomach feelings, you know not really craps, not really pain, just weird feeling. Its the thought of having diarrhea and crapping myself on a crowded plane, bus, coworkers car, where-ever. Strangely, I feel like if someone I know closely is aware of my phobia then it doesnt creep up, but I am reluctant to tell the world. This has made me reluctant to take better jobs in life, I will never eat like Denny's greasy food for breakfast, mcdonalds, or stuff that I am not familiar with, even if I want that. I need to change it ASAP!

So I once took zoloft (depressed at the time, then changed jobs and luckily snapped out of it), I didnt like it, I lost my sex drive for like 2 years. I stopped with that one and havent tried again. I have considered hypnosis, even though I believe it is some charlatan stuff. I have found some success with like this self-hypnosis thing on youtube. (if you want the link just ask) Is there some medication I can take that makes it just go away, and I keep my sex drive? My biggest concern is to kill the feeling of freaking out on a plane, because my next job (already lined up) is going to require some travel.  

Anyone else have something similar? Please blow up my inbox, I need to know about others and what is helping them out. "

I was depressed for 3 years and took some medication to help me out of it. I stopped taking it months ago because I thought I had improved enough. Now, I'm starting my 3rd year of college and it is nothing but anxiety about school and worrying about money.

I mostly find myself being anxious about being behind in my school work. But this leads me down a complex trail of thoughts like: I am never going to graduate and even if I do, I will never have a sustainable job, I won't be able to support myself, I will be poor and struggling and fail to pay off my loans. I think years and years into the future and how I have already doomed myself for the rest of my life. 

This thinking has left me unable to function, I can't keep up with my school work and responsibilities due to all of the constant worry. I think about these things from the moment I wake until the moment I fall asleep. I end up doing nothing but play video games and look at reddit all day to try to drown out the negative thoughts in my head but they come back despite my efforts. I literally do not know how to handle these thoughts. I feel that I cannot prevent my fears from coming true if I do not figure out how to tame my anxiety.

It started manifesting itself after I quit drinking about 1.5 years ago, I was a daily heavy drinker prior to quitting for 10+ years.  I quit mainly for my family, health, and to better focus on my career. 

After it started getting in the way of life in general I sought help through my health care provider in the form of therapy, attending an ""anxiety clinic"", and being put on various SSRIs and benzos to help curb the general anxiety and panic attacks.   I've been in treatment now for a year, I feel like i'm getting nowhere with it, in fact I feel like I'm getting worse.  I'm constantly wracked with indecision, regret, and illogical thought patterns ... thoughts that I'm fully aware are illogical but I can't shake them nor can I seem to just rationalize my way out of them even though i'm FULLY aware that these thoughts hold now weight in reality.

The meds didn't work, well they did help with the anxiety, but so far the SSRIs I've been on all make me horribly depressed ... but hey they stop the panic attacks!  I'm currently on NO medication because my last round of Lexapro wanted to make me kill myself.  I'm still in therapy ... and it's a nice place to express my thoughts and I find it insightful, however I just can't make ""talking"" about and ""rationalizing"" these worries and illogical thoughts remove the constant association of anxiety and severe panic that come along with the thoughts merely entering my head.

Has anyone not found these traditional methods of treatment successful?  I'm at the point where I'm becoming fully frustrated with the process, my anxiety is the top thing on my mind when I wake and the last when I go to sleep ... and I feel like I have no end in sight.  It then perpetuates my anxiety because I feel like there is no end game in treatment."

My mother took my step dad, little brother, and I on a vacation to France. We don't see each other very often, so she thought it would be a good way to spend some time with me. 


I knew this, so I decided to give my best go at being away from home and around two people I cannot stand to be around (my younger brother and step dad). I'm super uncomfortable and want to go home very badly, I'm desperately lonely, I've had stress headaches since we've been here, and I hate being away from home. I told my mother I wanted to go home and im not comfortable. She invested so much time into planning our trip, but I did warn her that I did not want to stay longer than a week (she asked if I could stay for three, I only wanted to be here for a week, so we compromised and I am staying for three weeks). She began to cry and told me she wants me to be comfortable but also wants to spend time with me. 


As I reviewed our conversation, halfway drunk and halfway through a headache, I began to wonder how she feels not being able to see me and now her work has just made me uncomfortable, the complete opposite of her goal. By the time the idea crossed my mind, I began to worry she might take her life knowing that my father will and has been able to take care of my brothers and I. She has access to quite a lot of medicines to treat her autoimmune disease, so overdosing wouldn't be too hard of a thing to do. 


Now that I think of all of this, I realize how useless of a person I am knowing that I can go upstairs and wake her to talk about all of this, but I am too scared to do so. Mainly because I don't want to have to talk to my step father and I'm afraid of the repercussions of waking my mother up at 1 in the morning.

I was very sick and looking back I realize I was probably showing signs of anxiety and depression over the pregnancy, however I thought once the baby was born I'd go back to normal so I held on.  Once my daughter was born, I slammed into severe PPD.  It's hard to explain, but I felt like I made a huge mistake, I was terrified to be alone with her, I cried 24/7.  My husband was not exactly supportive, he made comments like 'suck it up, you're a mom now' 'what did you expect when we decided to have a baby'.  He seemed genuinely stunned that I couldn't function as a mother the first month or so.  I got on Zoloft, got better, my husband and I mended our relationship and 7 years later, I have a beautiful child.

OK, that said, although I'm not depressed anymore, I do still suffer from anxiety.  I worry about things constantly, mostly about getting things done, for instance things that run through my mind on a constant loop - did I do laundry, did I check my daughter's school folder, did I thank someone enough for doing something for me, did I leave the sink empty, did I offend someone this morning - did I did I did I - and I have extreme panic if I answer the question with 'no'.  It's so maddening!  So a two years ago I went to a doctor that was recommended to me and I asked for anxiety meds, I got my prescription and came home and realized he gave me exactly 15 xanax - for a year.  But he made me feel like a pill seeker when I asked for the meds, it's VERY difficult for me to ask for help, so I lived with it.  

The last 8 months, my husband lost his job, my Mom had a stroke and my anxiety is has been off the charts.  But I have to function, so I suffer through it.  My throat gets tight, I've had stroke symptoms, heart attack symptoms, high blood pressure symptoms (although that might be a real thing, last doc check it was 155/95), mostly from my anxiety.  I do exercise, I run 20 miles a week, but even that isn't helping lately.

My question is should I revisit getting back on Zoloft?  I really didn't like how I felt on it.  Or should I try and seek someone that will prescribe me more than 15 xanax's?  I just want to feel normal again.  "

I was nervous last night and made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/q7il0/im_nervous_about_my_first_psychiatrist/) about it - thanks to all who helped (TL;DR went to see psychiatrist because I want to deal with physical symptoms of my social anxiety). In certain situations, my anxiety gets so bad that I have nausea. I've had to call in sick to work a lot because of it and am not working at the moment, partially for that reason. I went to the appointment hoping to get prescribed beta blockers, because I've heard that they help with physical symptoms. Instead she gave me a script for Prozac. I went home and then freaked out because I'm really scared of side effects and withdrawal. I've also had some friends in the past that have had terrible experiences with anti-depressants, and I don't want that to be me. So I called her back and told her I was really afraid and was wondering if I could try beta blockers or if there was anything else. She said the beta blockers are really more for performance anxiety and wouldn't help with the nausea. She also said that if I wanted to I could try Klonopin instead; she said it might help more with the nausea than Prozac, but might not be as effective overall.

Now I'm kind of in a bind because these are the two options I didn't really want to have. I'm worried that if I take the Prozac I might have some nasty side effects and/or experience withdrawal if I try to stop, which is a concern as I really don't want to be on medication more than a year at most. On the other hand, the Klonopin has a high potential for addiction and could have some side effects as well, plus you can't drink on it - although if I take it just for certain situations, could I drink on the days I don't take it...? The advantage to the Klonopin is that it would be nice to just be able to try it and see how it works rather than wait 4-6 weeks for the Prozac to kick in and possibly not work at all or make me crazy; plus, my anxiety is relatively manageable when I don't have the nausea, so it would be nice to have something I don't have to take every day. That way I can also continue to work on it with my therapist and hopefully be off of the meds sooner.

Has anyone taken either SSRIs or benzos for nausea and had any effect? Or any other medication? Should I consider getting a second opinion from another psychiatrist? I'm going to think this over and also talk to my therapist, but I wanted to see if you all had any experiences or input to share."

Background: I have generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks and have had this diagnosis for about two years (longer undiagnosed). I've been off my happy pills (Zoloft) for almost a year now. I hate huge social situations where you have to make small talk or if you are on ""display"" for people to see/judge. It'll send me into panic attacks before and during the event.

Event: My grandmother-in-law's 90th birthday party - yay, a large social event full of people I don't even really know that I'm not even related too! Yay. And many of the people in the family (my husband's) are loud social people. But not even the fun type of social people who get you to relax - they're just obnoxious at times and off-putting with their lack of intelligence or general arrogance. Thankfully I was involved in some of the planning and had the forethought to make the party work for me rather than the party working me. 

I offered to make a floral arrangements for the tables - that was ignored. Thanks. Then I offered to make a photo guestbook because it was going to be the ""gift"" and I'm a terrible gift-giver. That idea was given high praise because this family is into pictures - great! I can work with this! I gathered numerous family photos to make the book and as I did I realized that this family can't take a snapshot worth crap.

Side story: As someone who took photography in high school (we had a darkroom and everything) I know a thing or two on how to set up a good shot (looking back now I see why I found the B&amp;W dark room soothing - didn't have to deal with muchless see people lol). I also can't stand bad photography - check the background for the love of God!! No one wants someone derping in the background!! 

So it dawned in me - I'll be the photographer! Yes, I'm having to talk to be people, but I'm not really in the spotlight because I'm behind the camera. And I'm telling them what to do! I'm in control! Also, I can run off and go take pictures of people -- or things -- rather than having to make small talk. ""Ooops sorry! Duty calls!"" And then at the end I can make another photobook for Grandmother-in-law and be the hero! Best advice: find a way to take control of the situation that makes you happy or uses your gifts and talents. I feel lucky I was able to do that in this situation. Not ever situation lends itself to that.

So how did it go and what did I do to survive?

Pregame: Honestly, I probably should have taken small bottles of liquor with me to take the edge of since meds are no longer a thing for me, but instead I pregamed with my crochet (like knitting). I sat in the car (we got there early) and crocheted for a while. I knew I couldn't do it there, but I still slipped my yarn and needles into a bag just in case I needed to peal off and calm down. It's my soothing hobby and keep me from twitching too much - I hate being a twitcher. 

Event: I got to work right away. Taking pictures of the cake, table settings, etc. Forcing people to pose together (yes, evil me came out because I was in control ""no you move there, and you get a little closer, that's it!""). Everyone was behaving themselves and being over all pleasant. It was kinda weird. 

Then it happened. The ONE person who I could go the rest of my life without seeing shows up. We'll call him Walter. 

Back story: A few Christmases ago the family friend Walter was dumped on me. That Christmas I was going through some health issues and didn't feel good. I didn't even feel like moving and thus I fell prey to Walter. Now Walter is generally harmless, but he's a very loud, very annoying man who has an extreme case of aspergers. And before you accuse me of anything, I'm a teacher, I work with all kinds of kids and the aspergers are usually my favorite. But Walter does not even take the bluntest of cues - yes you just have to be blunt with aspergers. The other thing too is how I would treat an aspergers kid in my classroom does not look socially acceptable (you have to be blunt and it doesn't look nice, but there are small social cues that are lost on some aspergers kiddos). It's a hard card to play at a social event like this where you have to be socially polite and I didn't want to have to deal with it! He's a nice guy, but it was neither the time or the place for that kind of stress. And I've been scarred by a previous experience of endless hours of tedious conversation (I'm not a talker).

So Walter walks in - avoid, avoid, avoid - and it's perfect because I have a task to perform. I'll avoid as much as possible, but then he is invited to sit at my table. I noped out of there because I had pictures to take and it was almost cake time! A few times there was just nothing to take pictures of and so I had to sit and be social. I did my best to be polite and when it would get to be too much I would go take pics or skip out to the restroom - lipstick had to be reapplied!

Thankfully the event was taking place in a large building with a lobby near the bank of elevators. And as all people with social anxiety know the cell phone reception is always better in the lobby away from the party. I sat down for a while and did things like checked reddit, texted family, and I also had a friend on stand-by who is my go-to. If I need to get out of anything she will call me with a great excuse - and she's creative - to get me out. I seriously think she should loan out her services!

Having a ""get away"" place really helped in not only avoiding Walter, but also helped to calm me when I felt like it was too much. Coupled with a productive and creative task it was a much more bearable situation. 

Honestly, it was a miracle that I didn't have any type of panic attack although I felt one coming on that morning. Thankfully I was able to fight it off. But I learned that I have to make things work for me and not let things happen to me. 

Postgame: Today I am chilling at home with my pups. I have played around on reddit, written a few lesson plans for the week, and I'll probably put on Christmas music and decorate. It's my re-charge day. I have found it is so important to give yourself time to recharge after large social events. If I don't I will burn out and it's not pretty -- major panic attacks and hugely obsessive and unwanted thoughts.

Conclusion: Went a whole lot better than I could have imagined! I feel like I'm making huge progress with my anxiety! I still can't believe I didn't have a panic attack! It's so weird!

In summary, here's what I learned helped me:

* Involve yourself in the planning of the big event if possible (not always) to make it work for you. Use your talents to create a task for yourself on your terms. But don't give yourself more than you feel comfortable doing. Remember to make it work for YOU and not work you up!
* Pregame a bit - find a pregame task that is going to sooth you - jam out to music, go for a run, focus your attention on a hobby. Avoid obsessive thoughts about what is about to come - that always bites me in the butt.
* Give yourself ""outs"" - like what was suggested from an earlier post make an appointment or have plans that you have to ""rush off"" to. I think having my friend on speed dial as backup helped me even though I never used it. Allow yourself to ""disappear"" if you need. Find a quiet place and ""take a phone call."" Or as one of my high anxiety coworkers says, ""use the excuse of explosive diarrhea - it's too personal and is never questioned!"" I don't like hanging out in bathrooms, but given the alternative it is only a little crappy! 
* Come prepared with a few topics that you feel comfortable talking about or questions to ask people. I find this makes the small talk go smoother. Something I've been doing for years.
* Postgame a bit too: Relax and be alone. Let out a panic attack if needed (I've learned how to hold them in), or participate in your pregame soothing activity. 

I hope this helps someone out there. I find that I get a lot out of reading other people's experiences because I don't feel so alone. Again, I want to thank everyone on this sub who have been so helpful to me and to others. This really is a nice bit of therapy. 

TL;DR Went a large social event, Grandmother-in-law's 90th birthday party, and using my coping mechanisms I avoided a panic attack and only had mild anxiety. Hooray!"

It's only the second one he's ever had, while I've had them on and off since I was ten and almost daily for the last few weeks. Sunday night we had a huge fight because I had yet another panic attack and he feels like I blame them on him, even though I only want support. He pretty much blames me, because even though it was actually triggered by something at his new job he said he would never have been stressed out enough for it to happen if it wasn't for us fighting. I'm hurt and upset but he's probably right because I've been a nightmare because I hate my fucking life and he's caught the brunt of it because I don't have many people I trust or feel comfortable around. 

I don't for the life of me understand why me being anxious and likely depressed and hating mysel would stress him out that much, bu I guess I never will. 

Now he's pushing me to get professional help and that just makes me want to die. I don't know what's worse, the idea of losing him for his own mental health or the idea of admitting that I'm a worthless piece of shit who needs mental help and committing to a lifetime of heavy-duty medication and being a zombie. He says he wants to be with me but he can't help me if I won't help myself, but the help I would need is humiliating. I've been in therapy but I always refused medication when it was suggested. I know he can't keep improvising his own mental health for me and and care too much about him to want him to. I don't know what to do. Help me, reddit."

After being sick, calling off a wedding, having a dream job shattered, and having a major surgery I noticed, people are selfish. My last fluffy pieces of faith in humanity floated away. Why wouldn't anyone come visit me while I was stuck in bed? All my friends know I have no family to do so.  Gossip at work (even from HR) that I was not even sick. Did I ever stew. Having all that time alone to think about what went wrong.

I have always been an animal lover. Have cat named Strudel, and a snake Diegs. But I was still lonely. Enter Panini my adorable Ragdoll. He was a Christmas present to myself. The only way I celebrated that year. Ok I am not out of control yet...Then I offered to foster for a local animal rescue. The lady called to come do a home check. She was an hour and a half late. She texted asking if could bring a puppy inside. This starved husky shepherd puppy had been left by the dump. I was going in for surgery in 3 days, but I couldn't say no to those blue eyes. Millie became a new temporary roommate.  Anyone who has been around huskies should know of their dramatics. I didn't get much peace.

What followed was incredible ups and downs with fosters I tried to rehabilitate. Wish could tell all of them here but would take me hours, and not sure anyone is as enthusiastic as me about them. If you are comment and I can leave little bios with pictures. I was having a stressful day last year. I had to go to the pet store to get dog food. I stopped at the hamster cage. Walked out with Falafel Phil. Who would soon become HBO for cats, and dogs. I am starting to develop a pattern here. Down in the slumps = new fuzzy friend.  

Then I got my guardian. Rescue lady called, there was a huge abused most toothless malamute shepherd who was at dog control. Overcrowding was not making his 4 month stay look like a very promising future. We know by now that I can't say no, right?  Within two minutes he had sat politely for me, and gently offered me a paw in exchange for a soft treat. The poor guy can't really chew milkbones and whatnot. He stood up, wagged his excessively fluffy doggy pants, and gave me the lowest little howl/talk saying thank you. I could not let anyone else adopt this dog. He talks to me! Rarely hear him bark, just a happy low chatter. We could go back and forth for hours. I called the rescue lady the next day and told her I wanted to adopt Wiley. 

Now I have this solid companion. Socially I am still very introverted. Only going for walks at night so I do not see people and whatnot. Wiley makes me feel safe though. No one is going to mess with a tiny 5 foot blonde, while she has a dog almost her weight with her.  I however underestimated Wileys good looks, and charm. People flock to him for rubs, and to ask me questions. Good thing I love talking about him! There I go starting to open up again. That dog has helped me train numerous other rescues, makes me laugh every day, and is just the loveliest example of what an abused animal can be.

Damp moment here. Falafel Phil the hammy died. Who I quickly replaced him with Crouton the dwarf hamster. Then my python of 9 years passed suddenly. Adopted a breeding pair of winter white dwarf hamsters this time, Miso, and Sushi. I know I have a bit of an addiction at this point. These animals are my therapy. I quit my high paying office job to pursue a career working with animals. I did get hired too, as a vet assistant. Making minimum wage. Bit of a rant here. I was assisting in surgeries, euthanasia, office work, janitor work, grooming, animal care, medication dispensing, and going to multiple unpaid meetings. I would not be given OT as deserved, or breaks. And a 12 hour emergency watch shift paid even less than my hourly minimum wage?  Forget to mention the Dr. I am working for has the shortest fuse ever. It pushed me back in to the depths of depression. One overnight shift I almost took my life right there as I had all the tools. But the reason I was there was an elderly dog who was suddenly having violent seizures. I couldn't leave her. 

Finally reached out to the guy I was dating, and told him everything. He was willing to financially support me if I would quit my job, and go talk to a Dr. I did both. That was a couple months ago. Today I am making plans with real people again. My work experience at the vet paid off too. Got hired as a part time doggy daycare trainer. I don't even care that I make minimum wage either. Wiley and I are helping animals every day without overcrowding our house any further. 

Thanks all :)

I have no friends or anybody who can help me and I have no money and I'm just going out of my fucking mind! I live in the middle of nowhere and I can't even get help from the government I'm so fucked. I can't win the battle against my obsessive thoughts anymore and I'm just so fucking tired of fighting myself and reassuring myself and I can't sleep anymore just day after fucking day after day and I can't sleep unless it's the weekend. Every single night is so awful and the pressure to just sleep one fucking hour is so strong and every night more pressure and more pressure and it just never happens! I have a mortgage and all these bills and I have to be at work all the time and so early 6am in the morning until 6 at night and I'm just so exhausted. My anxiety is hard enough to cope with when I'm sleeping and eating but after days of no sleep and nausea I can barely eat. My hands shake constantly and I'm having hallucinations. The dizziness and everything is so unbearable and I can't even talk about it because nobody fucking cares about me at all. I basically beg my family for help and they tell me I'm 23 to figure it out on my own I'm not their responsibility any longer. And I know this is true I just don't know what the fuck to do. I want to self admit myself to an institution but they are so terrible and I don't have the money to pay for it and I'll lose my job. I can't afford therapy and I can't afford anything but Anxiety medications from my general dr and they just make it SO MUCH WORSE! The last anti depressant I tried seriously made me want to actually consider suicide because it was the absolute worst thing I have ever felt in my life. I'm just so stuck and lost and nobody gives a shit about what happens to me and posting to this website is literally the only thing I have in my life and it's so pathetic. I know this post is a complete mess and looks so ridiculous but I'm just so exhausted and I haven't slept in almost 4 days and I feel insane. I just want to sleep so badly.
