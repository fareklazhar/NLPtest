141,"The thing that completely underpins the whole concept of the Cabal is that it blocks people off from their full potential, and in this context that tends to mean their creativity, ability, and nonconformity; if I describe a person or phenomenom as Cabalist, it means that in some way it limits experience, tries to shove someone back into daily human life, like the sedative effects of psychiatric medication or the compulsory education system."

143,"i see my doctor tomorrow, so he'll which medications."
144,Some people tell me that I should be thankful that I don't have symptoms on medication and that I have a job.
145,"So that proves the meds don't work like they should, I guess."

161,"He's lived near me at his current location, a lightly supervised housing complex, for the past three years which has also been the longest stretch in over a decade that he's managed to stay on his meds and out of a forced visit to the state hospital."
162,"He refuses to work with case workers or psychologists and only takes his current meds because he's under the impression he has to, and won't accept any dosage increases or changes."
163,"If he lives on his own, he'll likely quit his meds and end up hospitalized again, and since anywhere he lives will have the typical noises of every day living that will eventually become voices to him, in a year if he's not hospitalized, he'll be desperate to move again with the same urgency that he feels now."
164,I grudgingly took my psychiatrist's suggestion to increase my meds for paranoid schizophrenia today.
165,She said she doesn't need medication anymore.
166,I take my meds as I am suppose to but I still hear voices once in a while...I went over a year in silence then their they are jabbering in my ear...I hope I am not immune I hope a change in meds will make it stop!

180,"The mind control medicine let's them into my brain and they know all my thoughts and they communicate with me through my brain saying they are doing this to make me kill myself I don't want to let them win 

How did you stop them spreading this lies saying you have ""schizophrenia"""
181,I was not taking medication regularly and was switching between medication.
182,"So in late 2008, I went on my meds."

184,I wanted to stop taking meds.
185,"So in the middle of 2013, I stopped taking meds."

195,That I'm not really schizophrenic and that I'll be ok if I go off my meds.
196,"I've been doing so well on meds, I don't know if I can mess that up, but I just don't want to be held back from losing more weight since it's been such an issue for so much of my life and I'm finally doing something about it."
197,"Is it a really bad idea to stop meds, if even just for a while till I reach my goal weight?"
198,"I stopped having paranoia / delusions when I got ""stable"" on meds."
199,"And most of the voices are gone, and when I stop taking my meds because I feel like a liar they come back and hurt me so bad that I start taking meds again, but what if I realized that I was actually mentally healthy and just wanted to make myself feel better so I started taking meds again and forced myself to forget?"
200,"* How regular are your symptoms, specifically hallucinations with and without medication?"
201,I think it's the meds.
202,Like the meds are making me less human.
203,I wonder if I should quit meds and just.. let myself be.

205,http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/849865
206,"I'm so sick of the well intentioned but ridiculous naivety of therapists who talk of ""thriving"" while they dish out meds that rarely work but are a Russian roulette of crippling side effects."
207,I'm also not currently on any meds and when I was given a low-dose anti-psychotic (Quetiapine) instead of anti-depressants I felt best but the weight gain was brutal.
208,I got on meds and things got better.
209,"My ""support system"" is no help they just ask me ""are you taking your medication?"""
210,"I think this means trying meds again and becoming the zombie again, the zombie who still hallucinates... have to give it a shot I guess even though between my heart conditions and reactions/allergies it is really a dangerous thing."
211,Says the place is making him crazy and the medicine is making him crazy.
212,Would medication that was successful to a distant relative  (3rd cousin) with paranoid schizophrenia have a better chance at successfully treating him?
213,"Thinking back to this I realize why she reacted so bad...My grandma has paranoid schizophrenia and when she's off her medicine she really does start doing some bat shit crazy stuff, but here I was calmly explaining to the doctor that I thought I was schizophrenic."
214,My mom is with us and since I'm agreeing and i'm so calm and everything she says it's okay and I'll take the medicine at home.
215,I'll stop taking the medicine and if I hear and voices or get paranoid I'll start it again immediately.
216,"Well...I stop the medicine and it's been 3 years, and I've been completely fine.No paranoia no more delusions."
217,I've been living at home going to school since starting the medicine.
218,I was thinking about how much better everything has gotten since I stopped the medicine.
219,"I agreed to just take the medicine and go home, later that day the mood swings have completely stopped and I'm back to my normal depressed sarcastic self."
220,"I have the medicine with me, but I'm unsure if I should start taking it again?"
221,"Over the years, she saw a psychiatrist (who she saw for at least ten years before stopping, but recently just started seeing again) and has been on many different kinds of medications including Lithium, Topamax, Ambien, Seroquel, Lamictal, and Depakote."
222,She was on a good streak for a while - one of her meds was working really well and she seemed to be as close to normal as I had seen her since I was probably 6 years old.
223,"When I forget to take my medication I hear myself talking to me, but it's not me."
224,"I am currently on several medications not related to schizophrenia, overall I take 6 pills a day which has proven to be a pain to get them all to work accordingly together."
225,"I have spent about a year and a half trying to figure out what medication for schizophrenia would work for me as well as work with the line of medicines I already take, after going through several that did not work / required me to switch another medication to a new one that wouldn't work I have decided the struggle of figuring these things out is not something I can handle anymore."
226,"I don't want any advice on medications, however I would like a bit of insight regarding things that other people do to calm them or remind themselves that it is not reality."
227,He thinks my mom ( who has been helping him this whole time and dealing with all his med and appointments) is dosing him with his pain medication he takes for his rsd ( a chronic pain disorder).
228,In the last few years it's obvious he has started using street drugs and stopped taking medication.
229,"I've been hearing my mother call my name, my brother who doesn't live here talking to me; I've even had two conversations with people who weren't even there after I took my medication."
230,"And now I can't shake the feeling they have to tell me something very important and I can't hear them with the meds so I have to stop, just for a little while."
231,"I just wanna hear what they have to say, determine if it's bullshit, then get back on my normal medications."
232,I need to know how long to be off meds.
233,"And if I somehow do get him diagnosed and on meds, would the medication even work with alcohol in his body?"
234,"I am 100% sure, however I have not been to see anyone yet out of fear of medication."
235,Also telling me my medicine will leave me comatose and when I am how I will be raped.
236,"We took him to a psychologist, and he was on medication for a while."
237,"Unfortunately my father’s family is very traditional and was convinced that there was nothing wrong with him, and that the side affects of the medication would be causing more harm than the medicine did good."
238,"My dad stopped the medication (after convincing the psychologist, and getting her permission) Symptoms started reappearing, but my dad insisted he had it under control."
239,That man only managed to recover by accepting the holes in his reasoning and trying medication for a week.
240,He’s been on meds for 4 years now.

248,He's not currently on any medication.
249,He doesn't want medication but I think he desperately needs it.
250,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9iwkMoZWnk

So John apparently has paranoid schizophrenia, and has said that he believes the medication he is receiving is poison, so he refuses to take them."
251,"- He takes medication, but neglects it from time to time."
252,I also know he isn't taking any medication... And that he's now homeless.
253,How can I help him take his medication?
254,I love him with all my heart and I know all he needs is to stay on his meds.
255,But now I'm not on the meds any more and it's pretty much impossible for me to anything school related.

A small excerpt from the abstract:

&gt; **Context**:  The use of antipsychotic medication for the prevention of psychotic disorders is controversial."
258,Since I got off my medications it has gotten a billion times better.

269,"He had all types of medications including SSRIs, anxiety med, ADHD medicine, but it seemed to only help a bit."
270,He wont even talk to a shrink and he certainly wont take any medication.
271,"I should add that he did get formally diagnosed a few months after he admitted to the hallucinations and that he was on some sort of medication for awhile but stopped it pretty quickly because he felt ""like a zombie""."
272,"E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (eg, a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition."
273,he has gone off his meds in the past and been admitted to a hospital after having a breakdown in public.
274,in the past i've only ever discussed these issues after the fact when he has been back on his meds for a while.
275,is it ok for me to ask if he has been taking his meds?
276,If you feel like your medications aren't working tell your doctor and they can see where things go from there.
277,"It's also a good idea to get a Pillbox with a calendar on it next to a bottle of water ,that you mark with a permanent marker every time after you take your meds, so that you know whether or not you took your pill."
278,that is considering that the sz manages his symptoms or doesn't have symptoms and takes medication so he is otherwise well and able to function physically and mentally.
279,My mother attempted to trick me into taking ADHD medication when I was in 8th grade and after figuring it out I dumped all the pills.

291,"According to my therapist, there's a fair chance that by my mid 30s-40s I'll have gotten slightly worse, which means I can't be without my meds."
292,Sometimes I just want to stop all of my medications until I get bad enough to need them.
293,"I know that's awful, but I don't even remember how I feel without medications, and I'd like to see that side of me again."
294,I was told that I would need frequent blood test for this medication.
295,An employee at the hospital said that she does not think I take my medication.

299,But the medication makes me sleepy.

305,"If you have not found good relief from your medication regimen, and if others have not quite hit the mark either, you may want to see if pharmacogenetic testing is available in your area (and if it's covered by your insurance)."
306,Long story short: it will map out how your liver is metabolizing different medications.

308,"Take meds for two months, feel better, quit again."
309,"While in the mental hospital they gave me risperidone, and a couple weeks after recovering and taking the medicine independently (about the average time it takes to actually work), I heard voices clearly for the first time."
310,"HOWEVER, These voices on these meds spoke with a different tone and different respect and different conversation."
311,"ONE of many reason why I stopped taking this medication is because one of my friends responded ""dude did you actually read the side effects cause it will cause you to become schizophrenic if you take it."""

Both the people mentioned above (black plump dike and unshaven looking white guy) took this medication at one point and shared the interest of religion, ME and jazz music."
313,is this normal for being on risperidone or should i ask my doctor to which to some of medication that won't lower my testosterone levels?
314,I just wanted to share some of my happiness at this -- for the first time since trying meds 8 years ago... and with several more years of symptoms prior to that...

316,"I'm 21F and have just been put on medication for ""psychosis."""
317,"I know that I don't have any symptoms on medication, and that I have a mild case of the disease (as my doctor told me) and can function normally, but I still have this irrational fear."
318,(Which apparently is a great anti psychosis medication)
319,"For the past 4 months that this has been happening, I've been on meds a month now, it seems like it's all new and is never going away."
320,"I'm taking Seroquel, Lithium and Lamictal but I wish there was a medicine that made this go away faster."

334,Now they won't prescribe a medication that has been successful in the past because of this.
335,"**

I've been living with severe mental illness since I was about 18, with 5 hospitalizations, 3 suicide attempts, every class of medication in the book, and I've now lost the ability to work and I live on social security."
336,"On a daily basis I also deal with severe depression, difficulty functioning and keeping up with medication/eating/showing/etc, intrusive thoughts and images (which are often extremely grotesque or sexually obscene - I DO NOT create these thoughts, they are NOT mine."
337,"In the past, I've had great success taking the medication Tegretol, but now they refuse to prescribe it to me because I'm not schizophrenic."
338,"My daily life is so broken, even with antidepressants, anxiety, and focus related medications."
339,"My current medications keep me from being suicidal and I'm productive occasionally, but that isn't enough."
340,I don't take meds and I don't go to therapy anymore.
341,Esp if not meds or therapy are involved at the time.
342,"They keep giving me medication, which only prevent me from having completely psychotic breakdowns, but I'm never really going to improve to how I used to be."
343,I have been able to survive in this state for a very long time without medication (about 3 months).

347,"They just prescribe an antipsychotic medication, my brother usually refuses the meds based on a real or fictitious aversion to some side effect (gagging while eating, leg stiffness, etc) and then they put him back on Rispiridone, which doesn't seem to be doing anything to help his auditory hallucinations."
348,What do I do if he refuses a medication or treatment?
349,I have a suicide complex and this medication amplified it to overwhelming urges.
350,"I do not want to commit suicide but I do think about it a lot, I believe this medication amplified my complex."

358,When he isn't on medication he seems to be absent and somewhere else.
359,He does go to his Doctor appointments but won't follow through with the medication.
360,"Only issue is, is that I am groggy due to meds."
361,I've been pondering and [I wonder] if the real reason why people with schizophrenia end back up in the hospital so fast when they discontinue their meds is because withdrawal from antipsychotics causes psychosis.
362,Maybe underneath it all [and past the withdrawing] [EVEN when tapered off meds safely] we aren't as delusional as we think.
363,Abilify 10mg is currently the only medication I take for psychosis but like I said my pdoc said he would lower the dose next time I saw him so I was just wondering is it common for people to be on only 5mg or lower then 10mg for psychosis/schizophrenia?
364,"although i do have one silver lining, from what ive read getting someone who has been diagnosed to admit they are sick and to want/know they need medication and help is a huge first step and it is something she miraculously came to terms with this visit."
365,but i also understand that this may change and there are huge flips and episodes even with said help and medication.
366,"I was in no way an ent before I got on meds, but I tried smoking with friends a few times and got nothing."
367,"I'm kind of apprehensive to start my medication, because reality as I know it will be  shattered."

377,The medication prevents you from seeing the pattern.
378,Whenever I read up on medication and the such out of curiosity I always see the terms positive and negative symptoms of schizo spectrum disorders.
379,"I am now taking the above medicine, along with 225mg of Effexor."
380,"We are charging that to Pristiq (same medicine, cleaner isomer)."
381,I'm just wondering if I should change medication despite seemingly finding the most relief with haloperidol and the most reasonable price.

383,"What have you tried, medication wise, that keeps the voices away?"

387,I knew that he would eventually end up hospitalized again if I couldn't convince him to take his meds.
388,"His caseworker and psychologist knew that he was off his meds, but they told him ""We can't force you to take them"" which made it impossible for me to convince him he needed his pills, even though they've worked great for the past two years."
389,If it weren't for my medication things would be a lot worse.

396,Hey all I'm soon to be switching meds to prolixin and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this drug.
397,I'm also not very happy on those meds because I can't feel happy or sad and I don't laugh at anything anymore.
398,My brother is taking his medication and they seem to be helping to an extent to keep hallucinations/delusions away but the things mentioned above are the ones stopping him from being himself.

400,"If you doctors REALLY think I don't need the medicine, then talk to me about it."
401,My psychiatrist told me that a combination of medications is a preferred way of treatment.
402,"I am struggling with weed and alcohol, so hopefully this little cocktail of meds he is prescribing me works."
403,"I just want to hear your opinions on the medication, that is if any of you have experience with it."
404,"Are withdrawals a serious factor in either of those medications, or any major risks of my psychosis being more of a pain in the downstairs parts than it usually is?"
405,He was there for several days without our knowledge and without his medication.
406,What if they don't give me meds?
407,"If my psychologist and psychiatrist decide that it's all pseudohallucinations (because I later on find out stuff isn't real, so I know the difference or however they explained it) and I don't get meds to help me, should I seek out another psychiatrist or are the meds not worth all that trouble?"

414,"Yes, I live with the symptoms which I have without medication."
415,I finally got diagnosed a year ago but refused medication until last december (when I had a break and missed my finals) because I was sure that I didn't need to start taking heavy drugs for something I've had all my life and lived with (mostly) just fine.
416,"I felt a little more paranoid but I wasn't sure if that was a side effect of the medication or a side effect of my brain freaking out because I was *taking* medication :P In the end, since I didn't have a doctor to guide me through the process of getting used to a new medication, I decided I should stop taking it until I had a steady doctor and just keep dealing with the symptoms of schizophrenia on my own."
417,I am going out of town on a trip in a couple of days and I just hope that my meds work by then so my trip is more enjoyable and I can be outgoing again.
418,I'm afraid of being misdiagnosed or any type of medicine they give me turning me into a brainless zombie.
419,"Other symptoms are mania (haven't had a manic episode in a very long time however, even off of medication."

429,She's taking her meds and seems to be sleeping well at night.
430,"This has happened once before since I've started my new meds, and I was paranoid and catatonic for like 3 days."
431,I'm worried that the paranoia might get worse than before once I'm off the medication again.
432,Has anyone had any experience with coming off of meds?
433,My very close friend is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic who refuses to take medication.
434,"Several times I have tried in the most empathetic and delicate way possible to convince him that he should seek treatment and take his meds, but this agitates him severely and causes him to distrust me."

442,She refuses to take her meds and will get extremely angry if the subject is brought up.
443,He recently has been diagnosed for all three and has started with medication.
444,I will consume harmful medications and they shall be your poison as it is better that you be silenced and ignored for the betterment of my life and the satisfaction of others in the accuracy of their diagnoses and their judgement.
445,i am a diagnosed schizophrenic and am not on medication nor will anybody help me or give me the time of day with my condition even.
446,I can never tell when he's on his meds or not.
447,"So I haven't been taking my meds, because the previous doctor would only see me every two months (impossible to balance meds with that much difference), and the side effects were too intense."
448,"I haven't hallucinated at all for the past 3 months that I've been off my meds, but I have been smoking like a chimney."

452,"I just switched medications about 2 months ago, and I've been doing really good."
453,Anyways he left me with the medicine that i had left and i had to take it because i go crazy when im not on my meds.
454,anyways the shaking wont stop even though i have switched off of the medicine (i found another doctor luckily).
455,"In his late teen years he went through a stage of legal problems, stealing pain meds, amphetamines, doing meth, in a small midwest town...after mandatory rehab sentences he came out and was clearly mentally troubled, but was staying with his family."
456,"So, long story short, my plan is to get off meds and street drugs."
457,"I'm not sure I want to do this, they want me to stop the weed for 1 year before stopping the meds, so that year would be so boring."
458,"I'm off medication right now, I was on a really high dose of risperdal and I stopped taking it because it was slowing me way down and I couldn't stand it."
459,So next time I can get new medication is July 2nd.
460,"I keep going back and forth about whether I want to, but my therapist is really encouraging it, and reassuring me that I'm just sick and can't see it, so I guess I'll give meds a chance again."
461,"I felt guilty for years that I was using the medication as a performance enhancing drug, and that I was cheating out my peers."
462,"She is hard to bathe, the has terrible odor, and for the most part when on meds sleeps all day."
463,When she comes down from her meds or has episodes it is bad.
464,"So making medication changes, or any sort of meaningful evaluation impossible."
465,"My best solutions are
1) My Sister improves with proper medication
2) My Sister is placed in a facility to handle her care better
3) I remove the Minor Children from the situation

I'm venting, but I really need help here."
466,It took forever for him to get an appointment with this new doctor and while he's been waiting he ran out of meds.
467,In December I was hospitalized and got out in early January and since then I've been taking my meds every day and haven't been hearing any voices at all.
468,I feel like.. like going off meds.
469,"I'm slightly considering going off meds, with my doctor knowing though."
470,"The meds I'm currently on, Latuda, works miracles."
471,But it makes me throw up at least once a week so I think I'm going to switch meds if not go off completely for a while and see where I land.
472,"So I figure if I go off my meds and things get bad, it's ok if I have to go to the hospital."
473,"I know a lot of people think they're better when the meds are working and go off and get sick again, but I feel like I could be better for good."
474,"I may just try a new medication and see where that takes me, and not stop for a while."
475,"I think therapy might be a good first step, and I've been more easily able to help people seek therapy over psychiatrists (though I know medicine can be effective)."
476,I desperately need financial help because I had to reduce my work hours as the medication was unbearable but I cannot keep up with the bills.
477,A friend of mine has paranoid schizophrenia and takes medication at morning and in the evening.
478,"Yesterday evening, he took his evening meds right on time but he noticed that he forgot to take his morning meds and he INSISTED that he take his missed morning medication right after he took his evening ones."
479,I don't know what the name was of the medication he was taking.
480,I stopped taking the last medicine I was on because it didn't do anything.
481,I am a perfectly healthy 25 year old woman and my ignorance about this is making me afraid: are there any possible side effects of the medication on our conceiving?
482,"I do know that the medication lowers his fertility, but does it increase the chance of any birth defects?"
483,I was on meds for bipolar for almost ten years before they figured out I wasn't friggin bipolar.
484,Is it a pipe dream to think that with medication and therapy that she could have a level of normalcy and that we could (potentially) have a relationship?

It's not going over very well with me I think."
501,"But since I am taking the medication, and I do not hear people inside my home anymore, I am fairly certain that people are talking about me, and that it is emanating from a source that has intimate knowledge of my medical records."
502,Some of these issues can be attributed to the meds I'm on and some of them are just part of living with schizophrenia.
503,"At first I was in denial about it, but when she doesn't take her meds the crazy starts."
504,What are some other meds that are known to alleviate cognitive deficits?
505,I don't mind taking my meds; they allow me to function.

510,"I do BJJ, and I really do not want to be so medicated that I can't do the thing I'm living for, a life of working and medication and nothing else is not a life I have the slightest intention of living, that's not life, that's existence."

519,"If you can share your experience with medication, that would also be helpful."
520,"Anyway, all that being said, I'm usually not on medication."
521,I have tried many medications and few even begin to work and those that do are so awful when the side effects are considered.
522,I am very schizophernic and going off my medication would cause me to be committed to a hospital.

526,I think I had a much higher sex drive when I was off my medication.
527,This was the first time having sex since I first started the meds.
528,How do I explain that I have a low sex-drive because of the medication to my partner?
529,So they put me on meds and I later decided that that wasn't the route for me.
530,(I know you're thinking why don't you Google it but that shit is hard) I need someone to talk to at the very least that won't try to force me onto meds.
531,"I've been on meds for a while (Lamictal) and they've definitely helped me with mood swings, and I also take Latuda for the voices and that helped a little bit, but the past few weeks I've been seeing things at night on and off."
532,"I'm not sure if what I am currently experiencing is normal in the ""recovery process"", or if the medications aren't entirely working."
533,"Granted, when I was at my worst I firmly believed in my thoughts and felt that the meds were being prescribed for the same reason as above: to prevent me from seeing the truth about my life."
534,I have been tempted to skip my meds fearing that they're getting in the way of my seeing the truth.
535,"My struggle with cognition: A drug induced recovery

I am currently perscribed two medications for my treatment and recovery of schizophrenia:  Zyprexa(anti psychotic) and Clonazepam(anti anxiety)."

538,"I really needed my medication because I was under a shitload of stress with everything, kids bullying me, I had that one best friend but she was depressed too."
539,"I'm getting my medication soon probably but oh well, it probably wont do anything anyway."

541,I'm afraid it has something to do with stopping cold-turkey on all of my previous medications.
542,I ended up abusing my Vyvanse all the time and resisting other medications.
543,If I say my leg hurts they'll give me medication but I NEED my leg x-rayed to find what's inside.

545,I recently quit taking my medication because I fear the medicine is meant to keep me confused.
546,I'm afraid of medicine.
547,At this point I have the psychosis under control (I even went off medication with help from my doctor and things are going well) I just can't get myself to do any real work.
548,My doctor recently upped my meds.
549,She does NOT want to take medicine and was baker acted appointed a court guardian at one point to have her take it.

554,"My doctor once tried to give me pills for my digestion issues (which, as I now know, are of a psychosomatic nature, so nothing you can treat with medication)."
555,Are there any meds available which could treat this?
556,"The medication (diazepam, I remember lexaurin as well) wasn't prescribed for her, but her mother works in a hospital and got it for her from her friend for her anxiety."

558,"Will they take me off my anti-anxiety medication(klonopin), and I'll be left totally raw and unprotected from the terror that are my emotions?"
559,"I've been taking medication, however I spend all of my time sleeping and even when I'm asleep, I still hear voices laughing at my expense."
560,I am like a hawk making sure she takes her medication and gets up in the morning.
561,"After her layoff, my mom offered to pay for her health insurance but she said she was feeling great and didn't need medication."
562,She stopped taking the medications and then the spiral continued.
563,I want to help my aunt and I feel that she should take the medications that turned her back to her normal self.
564,"Do you think they've moulded society in such a way that people with a mental-illness such as Schizophrenia are oppressed and forced to take medication, to suppress it?"
565,"I feel like a different person without the meds, and I never truly realized that until now."
566,"But aside from giving him the diagnosis and prescription for meds, they haven't done much else."
567,"After telling me that I might do better on different medication (negative symptoms), but then telling me it won't make a difference."
568,"I experienced full on psychosis for probably about a month, and then started taking meds that pulled me out of it."
569,"So far I feel very good off the medication, somewhat 'normal' ( I am still very nervous and antisocial, which was not the case before the diagnosis)."
570,I'm hoping this may eventually go away and might be an after effect of the medication I was taking.
571,I've hears the anti phsychotic medications mainly deal with the POSITIVE effects of schizophrenia...
572,I was diagnosed with chronic depression and I took medications for it off and on for the following six years as well as went to different types of therapy and such throughout that time.
573,"I've been on medication before that made me stop thinking at night and helped me go to sleep faster, but that also stunted my creativity tremendously."
574,"I have been stable for a while, and currently I do not take anti-psychotics (Haldol last year) My current medication is a strong dosage (200mgs) of a generic anti-depressant, and that has been a consistent dosage for more than a year."
575,He says he's taking his meds again.
576,"He makes dinner and watches movies with me and just functions OK. His meds are on the counter and I assume he takes them every morning, but what if that isn't enough?"
577,"There is nothing going well for me except for the handful of friends I've retained over the years, and the medication I am prescribed."
578,I am dependent on my psychiatrist to fill my medication prescriptions on time &amp; without feeling ambitious and wanting to experiment with my well-being.
579,"The only thing I have are my meds, parents, and my handful of friends."
580,"According to Western medicine, I'm essentially ""healed."""
581,"I tried going off my meds a few months ago in hopes that I had come to a place where I could handle it all, be Michael Phelps swimming in the ethereal waves of calamity."
582,The next two years were very difficult at times but eventually led to improvement and at my mom's request was told she could stop taking her meds.
583,I had a psychosis that went on for about half a year and a week after I stopped taking the medication it just went away.
584,The medication makes me quite asexual and that's not a good thing when you are in a relationship.
585,What should I do with the medication?
586,Because it ruins my relationship and I don't think that the medication is necessary.
587,"So, I've been experiencing psychosis off-and-on for the past 5 years or so, and I've taken various different medications to combat it."
588,"I am not sure if I'm just overly sensitive to the medications (yeah, yeah, who isn't?!"
589,The weird thing is that I took this medication for more than a year before they began.
590,I honestly thought the medication was going to kill me; it worsened my paranoia.
591,"Like the others before, I was experiencing auditory hallucinations while on the medication."
592,"Anyway I was put on rispederal, and I complied with the medication."
593,"Anyway I tried a new medication, this time it was abilify, and I had better results with that med."
594,I wanted to wean myself off the meds in a safe manner.
595,"They heard me out, and I was successful in reducing my meds safely."
596,I haven't taken medication for my symptoms since I was in high-school.
597,I'm just wondering if anyone else here is functioning without medication or has a similar story to tell.
598,Anyone else thankful for medication?
599,"I am on medication for this disease....I am in the middle of a relapse, hearing voices and such...When I tell my doc she will add another med which will usually make it stop then she will tell me to stop the new med when the voices stop....My point/question is what causes relapse, why am I still hearing voices while medicated?"
600,"I went off the medication because I was trying to do better in school since I couldn't think when on them, but now they're gonna take me!"
601,I have heard that when a patient goes off of their meds for too long then that medication is no longer effective and a new drug must be found.
602,"Now, I think this was true for the older medications used to treat schizophrenia, but is it true for newer medications like Risperidone?"
603,"I'm doing all of the things people tell me I should be doing, talking to a psychiatrist, taking all of the medications."
604,"Some people tell me that's normal, others tell me I need to adjust my medication, I don't know."
605,"Who finds out, and Are you held To legally abide with medication?."
606,I am worried that the side effects of any kind of medication will make her as miserable as she is now but in a different way.
607,I dropped out of my senior year of school and went to the doctor who convinced me i didn't have ALS and offered some anxiety medication which I refused.
608,"But anyways, we all take medications, a solid handful of different medications."
609,"Up until today, I was under the belief that no such medication currently existed."
610,I don't know who to talk to about this seeing as how every time I see a healthcare professional they tell me I am delusional and prescribe me medications that do nothing but dull me and remove my motivations for everyday life.
611,"I know some of what I heard has been a hallucination only because I've realized some of what I thought before (going on medication) was delusional, but I'm having a hard time convincing myself everything I thought before was delusional."
612,They changed my medication to aripiprazole tablets at the beginning of December.
613,I have been non compliant with the tablets to see if I could live without medication.
614,"I'm not searching for a diagnosis specifically, but I want to be on the right meds going forward, especially if I change doctors."
615,I had stopped medication suddenly and had it a few months later.
616,it was very powerful and it convinced me to go on medication for years.
617,"Also in all 4 cases, I wasn't taking meds when they happened."
618,I am back on meds now and I don't think I will experience anything in the future.
619,"So I've been on medication for the last couple of weeks, amisulpride, it's been working great but last night I heard a little boy running outside of my window, It felt like an hallucination but I was not sure so I got scared, really scared..."
620,It kind of feels like the medication is causing the delusions considering they're worse in the evening.
621,"My symptoms didn't start till 19, I was under medication and sedated for 5/6 straight years.."
622,And made the decision to quit medication and hope for the best.
623,"My GP as well as a few psychiatrists from various hospitals in Sydney/Melbourne (who are the art majors of the medical world and are total and utter rejects in other fields of medicine) believe I have prodromal symptoms due to family history of paranoid schizophrenia (father, paternal grandfather, paternal uncle)."
624,"No tests will ever confirm or deny their diagnosis and in a world where everyone is stupid, accepting their offer of poisonous medications is fucking ludicrous."
625,"If you do need medication, I suggest telling them you have anxiety for valium and/or a back injury for oxycodone."
626,"Anyway, I was wondering if I should go talk to someone and if there is any kind of medication that could possibly help this 

thnkyou"
627,"We didn't have the money to go back to her psychiatrist, so she went to a county run facility, which was very understaffed, but they kept her in meds."
628,She's currently in the middle of her second break that started eight months ago after she decided to discontinue her medicine without discussing it with anyone.
629,"Before this she had five good years on Risperdal, but now she's been bouncing between providers and hasn't been on the same medicine for long enough to see good results."
630,She refuses any medications to help her sleep because she doesn't want to.
631,I wanted to have him seek therapy and (knowingly) pass for schizophrenic so that he can have access to anti psychotic medications that he hopes will dull his powers.
632,"Hi there, I'm undiagnosed atm (psychosis is the catch all term for my condition at the moment) however before meds I found I had a block in my train of thought a lot as well as emotional blunting/apathy."
633,I'm on medication that seems to be helping a bit with me coming to terms that what I see and hear isn't always real.
634,ik a lot of the libido stuff down to meds but its the other things as well.
635,Recently my meds *seroquel/zoloft* have been increased.
636,"I need my medications, I cannot go back to the way I was before."
637,"There is no use in talking about medication or to simply see a doctor, since she will never accept such a thing."
638,"No meds, no therapist (I've given up hope on that matter)."
639,Due to my medication most of my positive symptoms have become less distracting or faded away entirely.
640,I think they still haven't found the right meds but she continues to go to the doctor and is doing everything she should to feel better.
641,I don't know if its the negative symptoms or the meds.
642,"If you're stable on meds, is it possible to still have episodes or experience hallucinations and/or delusions?"
643,"i am on meds - Xanax - to help calm me down ,but it doesn't seem to help too much."
644,"There were several reasons, including moving out of my psychiatrist's area, feeling like I wasn't sick and didn't need meds, etc."
645,I finally got to restart clozapine and am now starting to feel better with a new lesson learnt about continuing to take meds.
646,Would this trigger a relapse of avoiding her meds?
647,**EDIT:** Back story- I've been off medication for over 6 months now- this is basically how I deal with it.
648,"He sees a psychologist occasionally for stress, but as far as I know he has not been diagnosed with any kind of disorder or prescribed any medication."
649,I'm on medication but this symptom seems to have not gone away.
650,I was put on Risperdal because I had an allergic reaction to the other common medicine (the name slips my mind) and I have other factors that made it impossible to take the other non-psychotic related ones.
651,"Based on the results, we may recommend adding an anti-inflammatory medication to increase the effectiveness of your psycho-pharmacological treatment plan."
652,"I have been on medication for 3 or 4 months now and I, for the most part, have my delusions and hallucinations under control."
653,"We are headed back tomorrow, but for tonight I am medication free."
654,"Last time I went a night without my medication, I was not doing well."
655,"Since I started on ADHD medication at the start of college, I've seen people's faces morph into other faces while they're walking towards me from a distance."
656,"So currently, I'm off meds until Tue."
657,So I was having conversation with my schizophrenia and medication and the sudden question pops-up on the lines of: do you have to take medication forever?
658,"I started taking new meds, my old meds never seemed to help much."
659,"Idk if I should just wait for my doctor to up my dosage, or ask him to try another medication."
660,Ways to cope with every day life and our symptoms and medication discussion.
661,Do the medications and psychiatrist involvement really help?
662,"I think that's from medication, though."
663,He has been diagnosed and is on medication.
664,This has gone one for around 3 months as the meds don't seem to work this time.
665,"My psychiatrist says I need to be treated with meds, otherwise I will never be a healthy human being."
666,"Could it be a side effect of my meds, or is it a symptom?"
667,They were gone for months because I was on a good medicine (latuda) but the side effects made me switch.
668,I'm a diagnosed schizophrenic who stopped taking anti psychotic medication about a month and a half ago.
669,"Is it related to medication, the environment, or just something one's brain does?"
670,Max dose is 160mg so if that doesn't work I may have to either switch meds or add another one.
671,"I've been on zyprexa, risperdal, haldol, and saphris and those didn't work, so I'm worried about possibly having to switch medications."
672,"It's frustrating because I'm trying to get help, take my medication and be a good girl, but my support network is wacky and believes in the supernatural."
673,"she is even worse now, and refusing any medication."
674,Until now doctors are nice but the treatment/medication seems not making significant improvement.
675,"I'm not depressed at the moment (thankfully), psychosis.. eh I'm on medicine and it keeps me sane enough to stay out of the hospital."
676,"My current medicine, Zyprexa, has been working well and I'm a small dude so I don't mind the increase in appetite."
677,"soo i was doing really good i was taking care of myself, remembering things more clearly, was letting the details slide instead of panicking, I was working out and dieting and getting in shape and was just generally getting myself back together, but then i ran out of my meds and now i feel the paranoia coming back and my memory is getting fuzzy again and i see things sometimes and i find it way too difficult to talk to people i stopped working out for 2 weeks and i dont want to do or eat anything in patches and the worst part my hygiene is starting to slip and i dont sleep regularly anymore."
678,Does anyone know of any natural treatment besides prescription meds?
679,"((Continuation)) I'm so tired and fatigued, the meds might make it worse."
680,"I already eat for comfort, the meds will make me eat more, I already eat too much for the money I get."
681,"I'm on medication and all that jazz but that doesn't make the symptoms go away, it just turns down the volume."
682,"What kinds of questions should we expect besides what meds he's on, what his issues are?"
683,I'm having bad anxiety and my medicine give me restless leg syndrome so I feel as if I will explode.
684,"Hello, I have been off meds now for more almost 2 years without symptoms and have recently had recurring memories of child sexual abuse and rape."
685,The thing is I have stopped taking my meds because she said they make me a zombie and she will kick me out(I just moved back in) if I keep taking meds.
686,"I want to tell her to try and convince her I need meds, but at the same time I don't, she can see for herself when I start to get sick again."
687,"I'm really scared of the voices coming back, I've been enjoying having my mind be my own, but my mom won't let me take meds and she notices if I'm on them(cuz I'm a ""zombie"")

However, I'm going to go walk in to my doctors office tomorrow to see if she can prescribe me something that won't make it so obvious I'm on meds."
688,I was wondering if anyone else has experienced these problems with similar medications (atypical antipsychotics) and how they have coped with the problems.
689,"I want to get off the medication now, but I'm concerned about my paranoid psychosis."
690,"I've been to the doctor a bit recently for a new medication I'm taking for my ocd and told him about the voices, anyway, I don't even really know what the purpose of my post is about."
691,things got better as she started to take her meds consistently.
692,"How does one know whether the psychotic symptoms are very well-controlled by medication, or whether the psychosis one had was a brief psychotic disorder/schizophreniform disorder?"
693,I don't have a lot of stress in my life (aside from having hallucinations daily- which I'm learning to handle just fine without meds) and I think this is making me feel anxious.
694,"For a bonus question, do you think a mild anxiety medication might help reduce my breaks?"
695,I understand it now and after months of treatment and medicine changes I am able to live a normal life.
696,"My question - for those here that have gone through this process, either as a patient or a parent - how long did you have to wait until you had a diagnosis and meds?"
697,"I was on medication for all of these things (including insomnia) for about a year and a half, and have been off of them for 2 and a half."
698,"So, I'm on meds."
699,"They're wanting to keep me under these meds that actually make me feel worse, and I am trying to find out the reason why."
700,"I want to tell them that I am still taking the meds and everything's fine, so that they'll believe me and think they can ruin me."
701,"I feel like they waste my time, only to subscribe me medications that only allow temporary to no relief."
702,"I've used other medications since, to help my sleeping habits, and none of them help."
703,"My therapist feels I need to be put on medication because my psychotic symptoms have been consistent for the past 6 months and do not seem to respond to psychological intervention or my efforts to maintain regular sleep, healthy diet, exercise, and lowered stress."
704,Feeling horribly guilty for abandoning the people I used to hear(meds made them stop now).
705,I keep thinking I'm hurting them by taking meds and I'm abandoning them because I'm trying to convince myself completely that they aren't real.
706,"If I stop my meds it'll all come back, just like it has before."
707,Do meds really get rid of delusions?
708,Does anybody have a possible solution to keep him calm until he gets his meds?
709,Plenty of people get better without the need for medication--check it out.
710,When my pills for chronic depression don't work within 2 months I get really suicdal and find it hard to stay on any meds.
711,The fluctuation (before I set an alarm for 3pm everyday to take them) from going off then on my meds made me feel like I was going insane.
712,I think part of it is my shrink doesn't understand and my current meds AREN'T working.
713,"I handle my condition pretty well, I don't take medication because I don't want it to become the focus of my life, I understand that some of the things I feel and see aren't real no matter how vivid it is but I'm afraid when I get older I might crack, however I hear that in most cases it gets more mild and can go away on its own over time, what are your thoughts and experiences?"
714,"I don't know if he's on meds, though, I know he sees a psychiatrist but not sure if he's taking his meds."
715,I am just curious as to what medicines are available and what their side-effects are?
716,I gained 10 lbs in 1 month stopped taking the medicine along with 3 others.
717,I just would like a general idea if there is a medicine (anti-psychotic) that does not cause weight gain.
718,I know these are only things a doctor can answer but the last time I went I felt like he was judging me and it put me off going back to get a medicine change.
719,"While this is beneficial and I don't mind continuing to take this medication, the medication, which may be a placebo is not what I expected off this ""revolutionary new treatment""..."
720,This medicine has done very little to improve my self image.
721,"I'm diagnosed schizophrenic, I am on my meds (I'm not taking then as regularly as I should)."
722,"Now 35, still drug free but that includes any medication!"
723,Is this basically all that the medication is doing?
724,"I walk alone

Made of pieces

Schizophrenia destroyed me

Broken once, cannot reglue

Psychotic episodes run anew

The medicine, it does help

The voices left, no one to tell

The horrors of before I still fear

Nowhere to go, no career

My brain decays from the medication

Quiet thoughts from my meditation"
725,She is currently on a very low dosage of her medication (when she takes it).
726,When on an appropriate dose or different medicine she does very well.
727,I have suggested to her that she might want to switch medicines or go on a higher dose.
728,I'm currently off medication until Tuesday.
729,People with schizophrenia don't necessarily need to be on medication for life so it seems.
730,And some are able to manage symptoms without medication.
731,"I wanted to know from people not on meds:

1."
732,"If you been on medication before, how many episodes have you had before going off medication

4."
733,"How long you've been without medication

5."
734,"What are your symptoms and how hard is it to manage while off medication

6."
735,"mine started that way, I'm on meds now but it's not going that well, they do not take off the negative symptoms"
736,"I need to help educate my brother as he's only done a little research and says things like "" I never feel like the medication is really working"" and ""I don't believe they really know what they are talking about, they don't understand what it even is"" he is very sceptical of the medical community and doesn't trust their advice."
737,He has been hospitalized once and since getting somewhat better through medication and therapy has had some relapses brought on by the persistent drug use (has admitted to taking ecstasy and pot a number of times and raving/clubbing a lot).
738,Also can medication stop a psychotic episode
739,I've been debating whether to increase my medication when I see her.
740,"At the time I restarted my medication I was in better health, but lately my health has deteriorated and I'm starting to have some issues with my symptoms again."
741,Should I increase my medication to deal with my symptoms?
742,"And ever since I had a bad reaction to Abilify, I have been afraid to try other medications."
743,Thinking about changing meds.
744,I'm new to the medication.
745,I'm thinking of switching meds.
746,"Anyways, got hospitalized, got out, was off meds for a month or so, a little more, and have been on meds since."
747,My doctor is concerned about a particular issue I have (perhaps more concerned than I am) and seems to be wanting to press for medication as that seems to be the only thing available to treat that symptom.
748,"I can imagine very little worse for my cousin than to go back and live with her manipulative, selfish, sociopathic, bipolar who skips her meds and sometimes attacks people, horrible mother."

755,I'm on good meds now and I have a good job working with disabled people.
756,Last week I saw my doc and in my 15 minute check in for meds and such I couldn't help talking about this which he understood.
757,"I'm guessing this will generally be medication and therapy, but do you feel like it was a choice to acknowledge you were dealing with schizophrenia or was it something else?"
758,"He's on his meds now, has been hospitalized a number of times which included some therapy, but it's been years since he last had any insight."
759,"I went down with my meds, three years after this incident, slowly reducing them together with my psychiatrist."
760,"took some medications, came out of the psychosis."
761,"Either way, I think me looking sad has more to do with my medication change from Clozapine at night to in the morning."
762,Does anyone here have any experience with taking ADHD meds?
763,"I watch videos on Schizophrenia on YouTube and Dailymotion, and I realize they only show people that are on meds and still deep into delusions and hallucinations."

765,I have severe dissociation on a semi-regular basis (medication is helping) and have had a few delusions while high.
766,"Foster subscribes to a branch of medicine called ""orthomolecular medicine."""
767,Orthomolecular psychiatry is a type of orthomolecular medicine whose proponents argue that dietary supplements and other treatments can be effective in treating mental illness.

769,She regularly takes her medication and goes to therapy and RI meetings.

- Medication 
We're both on meds; I've been on antidepressants for about two years."
771,I don't get on medication until next Monday.
772,I saw the GP yesterday and told her how shit I think the meds are.. She just told me to keep at it for 3-4 weeks &amp; that the side effects will disappear.
773,Contrary to just about everything I've read on the medication.
774,I'm writing on behalf of my partner - she's currently in the hospital while they try to figure out her medications.
775,They diagnosed him with accute paranoia and once he was released hasn't taken any medication.

777,Does anyone have any experience with grape seed extract while on meds?
778,I have thought China was tainting my medication; basically the list of ridiculous could go on and on.

780,"She is currently 30 years old and living with our parents, who are both in their sixties and are aging quite quickly, and who have spent all of their savings and have gone deeply into debt trying to treat her and manage her symptoms (using both conventional and alternative medicine)."
781,I feel as if I'll never break the med working --&gt; not working --&gt; increase meds cycle.
782,*sick of meds* sooooooooooo sick of the stretch marks from the prolactin in my blood.
783,"She has been placed on several different medications, some of which worked better than others."
784,She has problems with taking the medication consistently.
785,"She becomes quite paranoid about where the medication came from, the people who are giving it to her (my parents), how the medication was presented to her (e.g."
786,"However, she is paranoid/delusional enough of our parents that she won't allow them to have access to any of her PHI, including where she is staying, further medication and diagnoses, etc."
787,"Though it is not related Schizophrenia, I do have a decent understanding of how the disorder progresses, prognosis, recommended cognitive/behavioral/medication treatment, and the like."
788,"How can we best encourage her to take her medication short of shoving it down her throat, which obviously will only reinforce her paranoia and delusions, despite the medication?"
789,I have not seen anyone or been on any meds for 6 months.
790,"We can talk medicine, relationships,  angels and demons, Neo, everything."
791,"Now, others ask me whether I'm ""off my meds"" because I seem ""excited"", and I talk so fast that other people ask me to slow down."
792,"And if this is my diagnosis, why am I not being offered any meds to help control the symptoms?"
793,"Because I am totally sane and came to them for candy they call meds, I guess."
794,It occurred to me that these medications are rather unselective in the receptors they antagonize.

What I already knew about Neuroscience."
796,"I never really got this THAT MUCH before the medication, but it seems to have taken the audio ones away but making the ""visual"" ones more frequent..."
797,Shall I try a different medication?
798,"Since 2009 when I first started seeing a psychiatrist, I've been on a slew of meds and most haven't been useful."
799,"By slew, I've tried the following...

+ Mood stabilisers - sodium valporate, lamotrigine
+ SSRI - sertraline, lexapro
+ SNRI - pristiq
+ MAOI - aurorix
+ AAP - abilify, invega, solian, ziprasidone, seroquel, clozapine, saphris, olanzapine

The only medications out of the above that really worked for me were ziprasidone and olanzapine."
800,"Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone else decided to come off regular medication?"
801,I've stopped taking the sertraline and lamotrigine and the only medication I intend to use is olanzapine when I feel things are going crazy.
802,I just don't think the meds have been useful at all.
803,So I just don't think it's worth putting medication into my system on a daily basis.
804,My lawyer told me to get an individual therapist (I go to group therapy and have a psychiatrist who prescribes medication).
805,"But with the ADD meds I feel like I can get up and do things, and can actually talk to people and hold real convos, and be more engaged in life instead of being ""stuck in my head"" 24/7."
806,I just think the risks are a little overstated once you're pretty stable with other meds/treatment.
807,"If you stimulant overdose then you can for sure get psychosis, but I don't think that happens unless you abuse your meds."
808,"There are risks associated with all medications, but a particular risk factor shouldn't be treated as if it's inevitability."
809,Potential side effects don't stop docs from prescribing other types of medications (and pretty much every medication has potentially unwanted side effects).
810,"I told my therapist and he said that that sometimes happens(I am currently NOT on medication, so it was kinda getting bad)."
811,"I'm starting to listen for them because they're not all bad and it makes me feel very nervous that they're not talking as often as they used to, especially since I'm not on medication."
812,"My dad ended up giving in to our conditions to find a psychiatrist and try meds (though he doesnt believe anything is wrong with him, I also believe he gave in just to get us home because he doesnt really know how to take care of himself, I think he will refuse the meds when the time comes which lands us in the same situation we started with.)"
813,"I want her to take her meds, but I'm worried that taking them will leave her teetering on the edge of normal."
814,"Like the title says, my doctor won't prescribe me any medication, even though she diagnosed me with paranoid schizophrenia back when  I was 15, and I'm 18 now."
815,"I'm going to be visiting her again soon, and I have to convince her to put me on medication, but she is so closed minded I don't believe she will."
816,"I'm not schizophrenic officially, but I have been on anti-psychotic medication (risperidone) for about six months due to an incident where I smoked too much weed."
817,Are there any other medications other than risperidone that help more with negative symptoms and cognitive function?
818,I gained about 50 lbs since using the meds so my psychiatrist discontinued them as I haven't had any symptoms since using them.
819,She has also been taking thyroid meds for the past 4 yrs because she had cancer in her thyroid and she had surgery to remove the thyroid.
820,A year after her thyroid surgery she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia..none of the meds they gave her brought any relief at all.
821,She has been taking her meds as usual and getting good nights sleep.
822,As far as we know there are no drug interactions with any of the meds she's taking.
823,"She doesn't have an appointment with a psychiatrist until next Friday to discuss management of meds , but that's still not going to address what happening now."
824,"To boot, I haven't taken my meds in a while, and I am just experiencing negative symptoms."
825,I have some questions about the medicine.
826,"They say that they will always be there, all the medicine will do is block me from hearing their warnings about danger."
827,The medicine will poison me.
828,"Some days, taking the medicine is much too terrifying of a task for me to handle :( Before I was ill, I wondered why some people struggled with such a simple task."
829,I seriously need a medication buddy or something so we can convince each other to take our meds as prescribed.
830,"How to make my doctor think that these attention deficits ARE NOT merely due to schizophrenia, and remain from the childhood, so that he would prescribe actual meds against attention deficits?"
831,I am on better medication and am trying to figure out ways to earn more income by going to school.
832,My grandma drives my aunt around to do errands at least twice a week and also makes sure she is taking her medication regularly.
833,"My aunt can take public transportation to get her medicine, go to the doctor, to buy and return things from the store, and to go to the food bank, but she relies on my grandma to drive her around."
834,"quick notes: as far as I know she does have a person to talk to, and I believe she does take her medication regularly."
835,Can it occur when people are on medication?
836,Is there a better medication that has worked for you?
837,"And I know its actually me trying to get help, but I know meds and therapists can't help me."
838,"But, I am going into the positives of medication."
839,What are some of the best medications you've taken?
840,How do you feel about medicine?
841,How has medicine helped you?
842,What are the negatives of medication?
843,"Recently, I was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and even though my medicine helps most of my symptoms, I still feel unmotivated for the most part."
844,I work at a residential treatment facility which is an alternative to hospitalization/medication.
845,Just spent 6 months without a hallucination due to good medication and support.
846,I don't think I can handle starting again with trying different medications.
847,"She refuses to take any meds, other than sleeping pills."
848,My psychiatrist actually tried convincing me the other day that taking medication will bring peace to the voices that are suffering but that's bullshit.
849,"The meds are blocking them, trying to make me like everyone else, pretending they don't exist, we're hurting them because we're not protecting them as we're supposed to."
850,"No meds or anything, no hospitalization."
851,"He said meds are a future option, but he's going to have to make sure I need them, after a good amount of time."
852,But despite being on medication he continues to hear voices and answer them and sometimes inflicts pain on himself if he thinks they are unhappy with him.
853,I'm on medication but it doesn't help.
854,"For first-episode patients, in case of full remission, it has been suggested that medication should be tapered or discontinued within six months to two years
(Dixon et al., 1995)."
855,"For patients with multiple episodes or who show incomplete remission, there are no agreed guidelines; decisions about medication should be made on individual basis, balancing the costs and benefits of treatment."
856,"This information surprised me because it seems, from my experience, most psychiatrists say if you have schizophrenia you need to be on medication for life."
857,Has anyone been told by their psychiatrist that they can go off their medication?
858,"My doctor tells me that marijuana defeats the purpose of the medication and works against it, but my experience is otherwise."
859,I eat antipsychotic medicine.
860,I know that is simply the medication makin' magic and if I go off I'll be trapped in the chaos once again.
861,"What good is Pharmaceutical medication if all it does is exacerbate my weakness, my fatigue etc."
862,"Most of the time it's pretty unintelligible so it's more of a novelty, but it seems such a separate aspect from the dialogues I'm used to hearing (I've been off meds for quite a while- I'm ""used"" to my normal ""tribunal"", but I don't think they're getting worse...)."
863,"I recently had a very bad reaction to haldol a medication that made me normal even a bit sharp for the first time in my life, four months of clarity tasks became easy."
864,"I then hit the wall flipped out lost my job became compulsive couldnt sit still, didnt realize it was the medication until I was on my knees two days crying to gid to make it stop, a god im not sure even exists."
865,Take meds?
866,"So Basically, Here I am on reddit, knowing I have a problem, can't take medications (which doctors and what not LOVE to tell me to just do - their rather simple minded, non understanding people), and scared every single second."
867,"My medications are poisoned I absolutely can't take them, and If i try and kill myself before they kill me i'll end up in one of those damn cheesy hospitals (seriously, I hate those things)."
868,I was put on medication and started seeing psychiatrists.
869,"I am finally on medication that helps for the most part, and my therapist and doctor is great."
870,Any tips on dealing with delusions or getting her to go back on meds?
871,A friend of mine has paranoid schizophrenia and takes medication at morning and in the evening.
872,"Last night, he took his evening medication as scheduled and he noticed that he forgot to take his morning medication."
873,He INSISTED that he take his morning medication right then and there so he took his morning meds right after his evening ones yesterday evening.
874,I don't know what the name was of the medication he was taking.
875,I'm focusing on medications and their side effects.
876,"What medications have you taken, what were the side effects, did they work, do you felt like they changed your personality/body in ways that was unrelated to the schizophrenia 

(IE, my brothers normally very active, but on his meds he's EXTREMELY sleepy, and now has become a huge movie guy because he just doesn't have the energy for anything else."
877,"when before this medication and a majority of his life he has always felt movies were a waste of time 'read a book, create it for yourself, work your noggin, and experience magic, each page is a new adventure, glu"" is the thing I remember him saying the most, my friends and family call me glu because I have celiac)"
878,I asked my psychiatrist if I can be put on ADHD medications and he gave me the good to go on adderall.
879,Anyone else on ADHD medications here?
880,I've been diagnosed with psychosis/schizophrenia and my medication has been changed a substantial amount of times.
881,"Changing medication, however, is a bit tough to deal with."
882,"This waiting period, since I'd be close to off my meds or completely off at this time is very stressful."
883,I once had to admit myself to ER because it got very bad - although doing this made the transition from my meds even longer.
884,I'm currently off one of my meds and I'm changing to a different one once I see a psychiatrist which is happening next week.
885,"The only medication I'm on is for seizures, although I have some benzos on hand for when I have a panic attack."
886,"I expected that he'd prescribe me some prozac or paxil or something and I'd be on my way, but he evidently thinks that I'm suffering from psychosis and recommended anti-psych meds, but I'm skeptical of this."
887,My pdoc seems super confident that I need anti-psych meds and that I will decompensate without them.
888,I've decided I don't want to go on meds (why would I if I don't trust his diagnosis?).
889,"**TL;DR**

My pdoc thinks I'm psychotic and need anti-psych meds."
890,My meds hardly work anymore and I just want it all to stop.
891,It's been a long time problem of mine and I used to take some anti-anxiety meds that had a light sedative in them before bed but ended up changing meds many years ago and the sleep problems came back.
892,Last night I was in the ER because I was having chest pain(turned out to be bad heartburn) and they told me not to take my meds since I was throwing up anyways.
893,"It'd have to be caused by drugs/meds or something, I think."
894,"Like the meds make the sounds.. transparent, but the people are still there, floating."
895,Soon i found out that she had been diagnosed with anxiety and had been given medication that she claimed made her feel worse.
896,Pain medications do not work at all.
897,I can tell because they are happy to discharge me on Friday without giving me any medication or indication of what is going on or why this has happened to me.
898,My medication makes me feel restricted even at such a low dose.
899,"He's seeking treatment, taking medications, and trying to make his life as stable as possible."
900,I am now symptom-free clear-headed but still on medication (Abilify).
901,"But I do have one big problem that I can't get over and that's pretty bad memory loss, I'd say it's gone from mild to moderate pretty fast (a few months) I'm not sure if this is related to schizophrenia, meds or some other health problem (definitely not aging because I'm not old enough for dementia)."
902,I don't trust the medicine because people say I don't need it.
903,"it said something to the effect of schizophrenia being like the word cancer in medicine, its not just a diagnosis but also a sentence."
904,You can have all the meds and psychologists your life can hold.
905,I suffer daily with the voices...I am on medication it does help with the other issues but the voices are always their...My father gave me an adderoll he is also schitzophrentic he said they do wonders for him.....I took it and it made me feel amazing the voices shut up and my frame of mind was great....I asked my doctor if she would give them to me I told her how they helped so much she said NO!!
906,I stopped taking meds by myself because my doctor was on holiday.
907,"I talked to my mom, she is a mental health nurse, and she said that it's totally up to me if I take the medication or not."
908,But the medication made me feel so bad.
909,I want to be able to take care of my body and with my medication I couldn't even get out of bed.
910,"I was diagnosed as schizophrenic a few weeks ago, for the past two years doctors refused to diagnose me and just kept me zonked on antipsychotics (seroquel) but im seeing a new doctor and he finally diagnosed me, he took me off all of my meds besides my antidepressants so he can see what im like with no meds."
911,"I told my dad, and he was mad at me and told me to go to sleep and thought I wanted attention and/or meds."
912,I want so much to be off medication but that will never be and I'm growing to accept it but it's still hard.
913,hopping back on the meds now :\
914,Did meds make a difference?
915,"I was supposed to go in Friday for another injection of my medication(Abilify), but I rescheduled for Monday, and I rescheduled again today for Wednesday.. so that's going to be 5 days without medication.. and I was already symptomatic."
916,So I decided to punish myself for that and just try to survive a month without meds.
917,"""Sorry, I was a dumbass and lost my meds and for that I've caused you financial loss?"""
918,Does anyone else get incredibly restless on their meds?
919,"So anyway, about 6 years ago when I saw my latest psychiatrist he told me that after five years I could stop taking my meds."
920,"I thought that when I would stop taking my meds, I wouldn't tell the canadia immigration officers about it."
921,"Well what ended up happening is that 5 years later (at the start of this year), I had a psychotic episode because I had stopped my meds."
922,Now I am back on meds.
923,"To the best of my knowledge he was taking his medication steady for at least a month, maybe two."
924,I think the medication helped with the auditory hallucinations but he was beyond paranoid still.
925,"Several occasions he stops taking his medication and he will sit there for hours smoking cigarettes left and right constantly putting his hand through his hair and is still just as paranoid as when he was on medication, just  isn't so visibly to me effected by it."
926,It is to the point now where I beg him to take his medication and he yells at me saying the medication isn't going to help him.
927,"I try to explain to him that medication can take a very long time to get adjusted in the system, maybe even a year(not sure if true, but for my bipolar medications I've been told this before so I'm just trying to help)

He is really bad at communicating what he is experiencing one because its so unbelievable and second he claims sometimes if he explains exactly whats happening to him he will die."
928,"I think the most they did medication wise for him in the last few months was up the dosage by a little bit and say ""he needs to be on it longer""

Now how the heck can I help?"
929,"I have been off my meds for awhile now because I didnt like what they did to me, and I feel like I can just tell myself that the things I hear and see arent real."
930,I try my hardest to keep up with things but I feel like some sort of medication could help me do a lot better
931,"I went the past few days without meds at home as I forgot to bring them with me, then last night I looked at the moon and thought ""I must be a werewolf."""
932,Am back on meds tonight so hopefully this won't get out of hand.
933,"How did you handle it (aside from going back on meds, which will probably happen eventually)?"
934,"A large part of my illness is delusions however; my medications are poisoned, snipers are trying to kill me, the government has a plot to kill me... stuff like that."
935,I am currently afraid to take medications so I rely heavily on coping skills to get me through day to day activities.
936,Obviously the best way to deal with all that is listed below is to remain on medication and talk to a doctor but sometimes you need to mix both.
937,"If you can get a great support system under you belt, great therapist, trust medication, and have a routine and a team to help you then this will help develop your own personal coping skills for any problem."
938,"Have people ""escaped"" symptoms without meds?"
939,I spend $15/medicine.
940,The problem is that both Olanzapine and Quetiapine have heavy side-effects for him and Clozapine is the only medication he really took well up to now.
941,I'm on meds but still I don't feel anything.
942,She says her meds have subsided the voices and rarely hears them now for the past 5 months.
943,Do you take medication?
944,I was wondering if anyone is or was on that medication and if you had any problems with it.
945,I feel as though I'm a psychopath I don't feel love or any emotion anymore maybe it's the meds the doctor has me on I can't seem to put a finger on it.
946,"On top of the stress, I kept forgetting to take my medicine (Geodone,) because my alarm would go off while I was working, so this day I took it early."
947,"I quit the next day after coming home, freaking out, then taking stress-relief medicine that I hadn't taken in months."
948,"Doing some research for university, came across using psycho-education as a form of medication adherence for people taking neuroleptics or, sufferers of schizophrenia."
949,"I was wondering, for those of you who have been diagnosed, how much do you have to spend on medication, say on a monthly basis?"
950,My psychiatrist has not been practicing very long and all the work she has done for the VA has been mainly focused on PTSD so she has reffered me to her boss who is in charge of the VA mental health department so we can get me started on medication.
951,What kind of questions and concerns do I need to talk with my new psychiatrist about since I'll be starting meds?
952,This will be my first time on medication so I am very new to this.
953,"He didn't want to talk much about the last 6 months since its too painful for him, and said he's on pretty strong meds at the moment so most of the time he's a zombie."
954,So until recently my psychiatrist only seemed to prescribe medication as a treatment.
955,"Recently, he informed my parents that medication won't help much in my case, and that I need training, work, and living independently, and that he will work on providing all these via mental illness help programs."
956,I was not prescribed any medication and I am stuck sucking it up.
957,i didn't even want to take medication bc I felt like my dad or family would judge me and that there would be so much shame in it and I didn't want to be like my mom.
958,"I ended up abandoning my medicine so I could ""wake up"" and I discovered a disgust for my overweight body."
959,Has anyone else had weight issues due to medicine?
960,"I started this medication not too long ago now because my psych thought it would be good since I was having ""symptoms"" of a pre psychotic break."
961,I guess I can't come off of meds.
962,"The meds help with the psychosis, but there's so many aspects of my life they don't help with."
963,"In her case she heard loud voices in her head, usually around the evening and was on heavy medication."
964,"On those moments I stop taking the medication and start to become extremely paranoid, that's when it comes to me that it is actually real."
965,The mainline medication is Abilify 10mg daily now.
966,Mental disease medication is tailored like most others.
967,"What type of medication is usually prescribed, and does it have negative side effects?"
968,"If my friend does not take his ADHD medication, it's very obvious."
969,"Hi, I've been on a few meds over the years and I've always struggled with the side effects."
970,"Now I'm sure some are going to tell me to just take my meds, I know, but my question is has anyone else struggled with not wanting the side effect of the meds or wanting to live a med-free life?"
971,And is medication the only solution?
972,"For the past 2 montgs I stopped taking my meds, because there were too many side effects, and my insurance woupdnt let me see the psychiatrist more than once every 2 months so we couldnt tweak it."
973,I am not any medications daily to treat my depression or my anxiety.
974,Was okay for the past 2 months on new meds but something is out there again.
975,"A lot of you seem to know a lot about psychiatric medications, have you ever heard this?"
976,"I've had a schizophrenia episode starting at ~13, that grew along with family problems I had at the time, and took medicine (mostly Risperdal) until almost 16 and hallucinations stopped."
977,I'm not on medication at the moment.
978,"I don't take medication, which I should, but medication scares me too."
979,"I'm terrified of taking medication because I don't want it to ""change me."""
980,I keep telling myself that if I develop psychosis that I'll be put into a hospital and get a few weeks off work and take some medicine to chill me out and that it won't be that bad.
981,"I have been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia a short while ago, before I was on medicine I used to smoke weed every so often."
982,"The medicine really helps, all of my hallucinations feels like they are really far away from me and it doesn't scare me when i don't do what they say."
983,"Anyway, my question is: what could happen if I smoke while on my medicine, should I skip my meds for a day if I smoke, or should I stay away from weed altogether?"
984,I don't want to be on meds anymore.
985,"I get paranoid in public, I hate the medication, have tried Risperdal, Abilify, (which made me very very sleepy) and seroquel, which just sedated me to no other."
986,Even if they are completely stable and basically symptom free on medication.
987,"My Doctor suggested that the decline in working memory might come from depression but with the antidepressant medication I feel less depressed than a year ago, actually I feel pretty good."

990,"His brother obviously needs medication and help, and my friend and his mom should not have to live in such a hostile, dangerous environment."
991,He told me he does not have much interest in talking to a professional and does not want to take medicine.
992,The medication turned me into an emotionless zombie and I refused to take it anymore.
993,I have been off meds since I was 18 and for the most part I have been highly functional.
994,I just discovered that almost every doctor in the states(and abroad without adoubt) is paid off by pharmaceutical companies to prescribe their medicine.
995,dont trust psychiatrists who seem to stick with the same meds in the prescence of new/changed symptoms.
996,"I had previously mentioned Buspirone, an anti-anxiety medication that didn't work for me, it amplified an overwhelming and negative urge to commit suicide."

998,She hated her injections and as soon as they let her start taking her own medication in pill form she immediately stopped taking it.
999,Around Christmas her parents started to notice something was up with her and of course i can't FORCE someone to take medication.
1000,While she was in the hospital they started her on a new medication and she seemed to feel a lot better on this new drug.
1001,When she was released she only took the medication for a couple days and stopped.
1002,"I saw her going downhill fast, she has problems speaking when she doesn't take medication and you can tell it's very frustrating to her that she can't form her thoughts correctly."
1003,She's not the woman I fell in love with and it breaks my heart that she would do this and not care enough about her future and me to take her medication.
1004,"When shes on meds shes happy, she can think and speak, we don't fight, everything is good but she says she ""hates"" how it makes her feel."
1005,I'm concerned I'm taking too much medication but my psyciatric nurse keeps telling me that I'm on a low dose of medication and not to worry about it so much.
1006,I kind of feel like she is fobbing me off and making excuses because she doesn't want me to stop taking my medication but they have such a negative effect on me I'd rather stop.
1007,I responded well to medication and was able to return to college after having been homeless for a couple days.
1008,I'm convinced the big pharam is very happy with patients having to take their medicine for life and wouldn't want them to be actually cured for good.
1009,"So, I've been off my medication for a month or so now and some shit happened that really got to me, needless to say I can feel pretty depressed (even though I can't feel anything, I just know I feel like complete shit), I can't think, like all my thoughts are fuzzy, I don't know."
1010,"I also suffer from schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, but I'd like to advocate for it and share my story, to help those who are suffering know that you can still live an awesome life on the right meds!"
1011,"Exercise is shown to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, it also helps with the brain shrinkage effect of anti psychotic medication."

1013,I can't get my medicine this week.
1014,"I'm wondering; because, I thought my most recent meds took all my symptoms away."
1015,"However, my psychologist politely informed that I needed to try and find meds that work better."
1016,"I think they are planning to put me on clozaril ,since I am medication resistant and have frequent suicidal episodes, so anyone here been able to get rid of all or most of their symptoms?"
1017,I went to the doctors office and apparently the pharmacy didn't fill out some form and didn't send the medication.
1018,":/

It's the best medication for me."
1019,"I don't feel like I'm on medication at all because it doesn't make me tired, gain weight, and I don't have to take a pill every day."
1020,"So, I guess I've been 2 days without meds."
1021,My doctor didn't give me any other medication in place of the Abilify.. so I'm just without anything.
1022,How to get my psychiatrist to think seriously of ADHD and prescribe me medication for it without him attributing all these symptoms to the anti-psychotics I'm taking or my illness itself?
1023,"I really want to perform on a level which is adequate for my mental capacity, and seeking medication for this condition is the best thing I could do to achieve this."
1024,I'm on meds.
1025,"At my last doctor's appointment before I retired from the Marine Corps we discussed tapering down on my medications (Trazodone, Zyprexa, Adderall, Nexium, propanolol, ambien)

I stopped taking my Zyprexa completely for a week."
1026,I'm also not sure if what happened was the actual underlying problem or just the withdrawals from the medication.
1027,"Ive been in mental hospitals for multiple suicide attempts and self harm, ive been on quite a few meds, some im still on."

1029,I want to get back on medication but I feel like it is poisoning me.
1030,"I don't hear physical voices, but until I got on meds I had non stop thoughts that I thought were coming from invisible beings near me, different from standard intrusive thoughts."
1031,"Five, almost six years ago I was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and began psychiatric medication."
1032,"That the medication you started taking that coincided with the onset of lacking passion was supposed to help, even if just a little bit."
1033,"If there was one thing that the medicine did do, it was to make me apathetic."
1034,"I attributed, whether correctly or incorrectly the insomnia to the medication and I cut my dose significantly, even switching medications."
1035,There are almost no studies that followed patients that had refused medication long term.
1036,Animal studies eventually indicated that the loss in volume previously attributed to schizophrenia might very well be caused by medication.
1037,"Knowing that the medication causes very noticeable changes in several areas of the brain, how do you whether to attribute changes in cognitiion to the illness or to a “side effect” of the medication?"
1038,"Put another way, to a lay person it seems like most of what we know about schizophrenia may have been confounded by the medication."
1039,The papers still being published about the “neuro-protective” nature of the medication have interesting things in the disclosures section.
1040,"My passion has not returned, so I do not know which of the following is true:

It was a side effect of the medication, and if given more time will return."
1041,"It is permanent damage from the medication, and will not return."
1042,"The medication simply made me not care, but knowing that it would not get better would cause me to not want to deal with the terrible side effects the drugs have to be worth having that apathy."
1043,"I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI (ADHD without hyperactivity), but never put on medication until recently."
1044,Before medication a few hours -- and if its severe I'd just lay in bed throughout the day.
1045,The reason I ask is that I currently do this - for putting meds in daily pillbox chambers.
1046,"I only refer it to ""progress"" is because as soon as he is released and back with my mom and I, he stops taking his medicine eventually."
1047,"His last doctor told us that his medicine did have side effects (loss of appetite, drowsiness, his leg would shake uncontrollably), but she also mentioned that going off the medicine would mess with his brain even more."
1048,I had heard in the past that he had been using various drugs and unless fed his medication he wouldn't take it.
1049,I also see shadows when I'm off of my medication.
1050,He is a long term user of anti psychotic drugs and though his psychiatrist has recently changed his medication to hopefully mitigate this he knows that the nerve damage may well be permanent.
1051,"My family has been trying to get my mother who is a paranoid schizophrenic on meds for over a decade and on government assistance, but she fights everyone who tries to help her."
1052,"Or even better, how can I get my mom on meds if she won't even admit to being ill?"
1053,"But then he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and the medication he was on was good for about 5 years, but then it stopped working."
1054,"My meds got increased, and now they're gone, and I feel kinda empty."
1055,I don't want to be on meds.
1056,For two years I dealt with voices without any meds.
1057,"This sucks, as you know, because these meds make you crave food."
1058,"Got the meds back, seeing a new therapist and psychiatrist asap."
1059,I fucking HATED taking that medicine but it allowed me to function.
1060,And my failure to admit something was wrong with the way I thought was also why I thought I could stop taking my medicine.
1061,"I remembered talking about my medicine choices with the nurse and the psychiatrist told her she didn't want him on a mood stabilizer, she wanted me on an antipsychotic."
1062,"But I think as long as I take this medicine, no more audible voices will come out of it."
1063,I have before when not on meds.
1064,For some reason the same thing when it happens off medication is the start of some journey into insanity.
1065,But not when I take my meds.
1066,Will the medication ever give up one me.
1067,"I basically had my dad back, as long as he took his meds."
1068,"He started to skip his meds, and it is important to mention that he is a paranoid schizophrenic."
1069,We tried everyday to get him back to his meds or to see a doctor and that we love him and want him to be healthy... but it was no use.
1070,He's off an on with taking any medications (right now he's off) and it is painfully obvious to everyone when he's off them.
1071,"I've asked him before why he doesn't take his meds, and he says they make him cloudy, groggy, etc."
1072,So I ask him why he hasn't gone to his psychiatrist to get a new medication or change the dosage.
1073,"I'm not sure what type she has, but she's been to the doctor/therapist and received medicine for it."
1074,"She is still on medicine, and you can definitely tell when it works (and when she's actually taking it)."
1075,Then I believe she saw a therapist and got medicine.
1076,"He takes no medications, he just learned to recognize when it would start to ""speak up""."
1077,I know he hasn't taken medicine in ~6 months.
1078,I am now on medication and i have a scheduled appointment with a psychiatrist.
1079,I don't know if I want to take the medication and since the doctor I've just literally felt a lot worse.
1080,as a family  At some point her medication changed and so did she.
1081,"Again, her medication was altered."
1082,"She went to therapy and tried a lot of meds, but I knew she wasn't seeing anyone presently and was not medicating with anything other than marijuana."
1083,"However, I suffer from bouts of severe suicidal depression even when being compliant when the meds."
1084,"I want to stop my medications, but it doesn't matter I ran out of my medications."
1085,I'm afraid to leave the house to pick up the medications.
1086,He’s been on just about every medication imaginable.
1087,"It was chalked up to be from all the medications he was on, so they quickly changed medications."
1088,"As far as I know, once the medications were changed the voices and the misinterpreting decreased."
1089,Do you ever have episodes even with medication?
1090,What medication has helped you the most?
1091,"My grandmother drives to make sure my aunt takes her medicine, she picks up the rx from the pharmacy, takes her grocery shopping, and helps her run errands."
1092,I cut back on my medication to 1/4 of the normal dose.
1093,I'm doing SO much better than on a full dose of medication and antidepressants.
1094,"I suppose I should start taking my meds again... but, on my meds I feel nothing but a void."
1095,"then she stopped taking meds, because she doesnt trust doctors."
1096,He's been taking meds for years but I'm not seeing any improvement in his health at all.
1097,Been getting shots of meds once a month.
1098,"I've talked to my psychiatrist about this, but his ""solution"" was to up my meds to help control the squatters, and I already hate being on the meds in the first place, and they don't really help in the first place."
1099,"In Chinese medicine the spleen is responsible for worry and excessive thoughts, it is considered one of the most important organs."
1100,Does it work worse or not at all on medication?
1101,Put on antipsychotic medication which reduced my positive symptoms by 100%.
1102,I have 2 weeks worth of medication but after that I'm out.
1103,Well I've been hearing voices since last year and I've been to a psychiatrist and the meds he prescribed helped.
1104,He doesn't have his medication with him.
1105,"I am able to get myself out of deeper ruts without medication, but was always to scared to bring up hallucinations and my severing from reality from time to time."
1106,"When she's returned, the mother has stopped taking her medication."
1107,"What kinds of medication have you found to be the most effective in at least quieting the voices, if not stopping them?"
1108,Have you ever stopped taking your medication?
1109,I don't know if it's a side effect of medication or a symptom...
1110,I've been on various medications and have tried group therapy but none of it seems to help much.
1111,"I don't want to go off my meds, I don't want to do anything bad, except cut myself, but I wont, because I don't want to go back to that place."
1112,"One thing I've noticed though whenever I was talking with the social assistant from the government is how she mentioned medication all the time, like asking me if I had been given medication for my symptoms in the past, asking about other (non-psychiatric) medication, and so on."
1113,It's not exactly a situation where I'd think that medication would be necessary.
1114,"But now I'm kinda fearing that I'll get medication forced upon me and I'm kinda scared of that, mostly due to the well-known side effects."
1115,"I am the one who gives her medication, makes sure she eats and I make sure sharp objects are out of her reach so I know she can not do anything that way... but there are of course so many other ways that I can not prevent."
1116,"He might say: ""Well I take my medication regularly and have been for 20 years."
1117,I'm terrified of antipsychotic medication because of a terrible experience I had with Haldol.
1118,"If I refuse this medication, and I am schizophrenic, will I get worse?"
1119,"And I do know that you're always supposed to take medication if your doctor says to, but I feel like I haven't been sick enough yet to know if I really am schizophrenic, even though I do meet onset criteria, and paranoid schizophrenia criteria...

Help please?"
1120,Because of bad experience with my most recent medication I've attacked him 3 times; he left.
1121,"I've tried so, so many different medicine."
1122,The medicine either aggravates the symptoms or does nothing whilst side effects run havoc on my body.
1123,I've tried medicine.
1124,"I'm getting more ill with the day, and I've read many horror stories here that people who don't use meds end up either dead, in jail, or lose themselves."
1125,"I've lost most of my education (I was a very smart/good student), I've gained about 85-90 pounds in a fucking year from this medication and I don't even eat a lot, I eat normally."
1126,"I've recently become stable on medication, and I keep reliving moments of the past year and a half when I thought my delusions and hallucinations were real.....it feels like PTSD."
1127,I read it can be a side effect to some medicine and it started when she started taking the medicine so I'm pretty sure it's the medicine.I don't see the problem but she is freaked out.
1128,So the question is besides stopping or changing meds is there anything she can do to going back to her normal cycle.
1129,My doctors have decided to keep me on my medication for four more months to see what's wrong with me but I can't cope like this it's torture.
1130,"She was fine until then but suddenly, she started refusing her medication so that's why that thing happened."
1131,And I gotta mention that all these month she has had an epsiode every month because she's still refusing to take her meds in time and her episodes are getting worse and worse).
1132,"so I think their psychic ressonance might be healing mental problems without meds or treatment because it gives psi to mentally ill, which is a lack of psyche if you think about it."
1133,My parents constantly remind me that it's bad for me to smoke my prescribed medications.
1134,"have you guys ever felt that desperation you know the one where you are the only person in the world that can truly understand you and your experiences, how everyone always peers inside the room that is you and takes small pieces of information out of that room and compares it to their experiences, kind of like comparing an apple to an orange and they completely misunderstand the point you are trying to make, for example while you read this you will project your own ideas into this because that's the only way people seem to understand things, that desperation then becomes depression, and its like oil to a flame, and everything just goes to shit delusions rise, hallucinations worsen, the placebo of the sanctuary ( medication) no longer works unless its in high doses you know what i mean( kind of like when you drink alcohol and one beer is not enough so you end up drinking and drinking until you go numb and forget who you are but you never truly forget who you are its always there like your shadow just waiting for you to notice it), soon after nothing seems real, you know its a dream and you lose the will to go on, you make excuses and argue with yourself about meaning."
1135,"I can't hear them anymore, meds are functioning properly to rid me of the suffering, screaming, whispering voices."
1136,"I go straight to thinking, ""of course the medication is working, it's not meds for schizophrenia, that's what they'd have me believe, but it's really to block my inter-dimentional listening abilities."""
1137,None of the people working with him can suggest any meds that will work.
1138,"As well as agreeing that in general it just makes him worse, regardless of medication or how he's treated."
1139,"He's very small (4'9) and underweight, has a terrible immune system and seems to react badly to any meds that he's given, at the moment he can't even take meds, eat or drink without feeling sick."
1140,"I feel like I’m getting more and more frantic about him, and that a lot of our interactions now center around my trying to get him to take medication and quit the damn weed."
1141,Should I keep bringing up the medication or just let it drop?
1142,"What I'm wondering is: Do they put you on medication without diagnosing you, or do you have to be diagnosed with schizophrenia in order to be given medication?"
1143,"I don't care if I'm officially diagnosed as a schizophrenic or not, I just want to be put on the medication as soon as possible."
1144,"Hi all, I'm a multiple-times diagnosed schizophrenic who is considering going through a few months of non-FDA approved medication and inpatient care."
1145,"Hi everyone, I have been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and taking anti-psychotic medicine daily for it."
1146,"While I am not psychotic right now, everything feels under control and I intend to take my anti-psychotic medication for life, I still feel there should be some kind of mention in my OkCupid profile about this, however, I do not know if I should outright say I've been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia or if there is a more vague yet equally effective umbrella term for someone like me."
1147,Do you take any other meds on top of it?
1148,I feel like I want to switch meds.
1149,I've been on the same medications for 5 years and they've kept me stable for most of this time.
1150,"I know, I know, talk to my doctor before going off the meds."
1151,I'm so fat and ugly and the meds made it worse and now my mom hates me.
1152,i'll be on meds forever.
1153,"She told me she went of her meds, I told her thats the dumbest fucking thing ive ever heard and she explained that she can keep it together and its all about concentration."
1154,"He isn't taking any medication, no therapy, no assistance."
1155,I believe he needs some meds and assistance.
1156,"His mother is no help, probably the opposite of help, since she doesn't believe in medication."
1157,I think he needs a social worker to help get benefits and a good doctor to find the medication that is going to help him the most.
1158,"Anyway; I'm married to a 24 year old diagnosed schizophrenic, whom is on medication, and doing well considering how hard life can be."
1159,"I'm currently off my meds and I function perfectly fine but the moment I make a call to them, afterwards my thoughts start going erratic."
1160,Does anyone have any personal experience with taking alternative medicines for schizophrenia?
1161,"It has been a long time since I have read up on Orthomolecular medicine, so I am not familiar with what exactly it is (sorry, bad OP) other than using a more nutritional approach to battle such illnesses or diseases."
1162,"Until last week she ran out of her medication, decided she felt better for it and now is refusing to take it (the doctor would also only give her a month perscription this time instead of three so we think he's concerned about ODing)

It's been about 2 weeks since she last took it, and she's been acting very strangely."
1163,2) If she continues to refuse her meds should he call her doctor?
1164,"For those diagnosed with schizophrenia or other forms of psychosis, does one usually have to take their medications for their entire life?"
1165,"Or is there a rule in psychiatry that, after x psychosis-free years one can discontinue medication?"
1166,"The reason why I'm asking is that most anti-psychotic medications have been proven to cause diabetes, increased risk of heart attack, etc., and I don't want to take additional risks."
1167,So how soon can one usually discontinue one's medication WITH doctor's approval?
1168,I have since seen interviews where Greenberg is adamant that she has never taken medication and believes that most schizophrenics could live stable lives if they participated in years of intensive therapy as she did.
1169,There is a strong stigma about taking psychoactive medication that prevents people from talking about it.
1170,"There is a myth, or partial truth, that anti-psychotic medication turns people in to zombies, or, more realistically drain a person of motivation and energy."
1171,"I would not have sought treatment, therapy, or medication until my parents threatened to kick me out of their house."
1172,"I was eventually on a regimen with anti-psychotic, stimulant, and anti-anxiety medications."
1173,About a month after I started taking the medication I had a memory of child sexual abuse and recalled the rape I experienced in college.
1174,I took the medication regularly for six months in the first half of 2012.
1175,"Now I'm reading up on the side effects of this medication, which I really shouldn't be doing."
1176,"If anyone can tell me what this medication is like and their experiences with it, that'd help."
1177,"Also I'm not completely sure that it is this medication, I forgot the name of the medication and had to look up a list of every anti psychotic, and I looked through it looking for one to jump start my memory, and I think that it may have been this one, it began with an Ap, and the doctor said it's a very gentle anti psychotic and it's supposed to cause restlessness quite often."
1178,"I am currently at ruby Tuesdays and I am paranoid, Ps I took my meds and ruby Tuesdays is a restaurant"
1179,"For myself, I experience minor memory problems that my doctor says may be due to my illness or the medication."
1180,Life seems so... 2-D compared to when I was under-medicated/off medication.
1181,I'm extremely hesitant to take the medicine prescribed.
1182,"Also, have you found any relief from anything outside of medicine or while off of medicine?"
1183,"I feel like life is not worth living because all i will do for the rest of my life is wake up, go to work, come home, go to bed and take meds."
1184,"He's fine at home and we understand that very few people with his condition stick to their meds, however, he has become violent towards our father."
1185,"During his psychotic episode during that month, he was hospitalized at 4 different mental hospitals, tried 3 different meds (Zyprexa 30 mg for 3 weeks, Risperdol for 2 days, Haldol for 2 days - this helped a bit but gave him bad restless legs so he stopped and his psychosis rebounded)."
1186,He’s going to ask the doctor to change medicine.
1187,I'm scared that I won't be able to afford my meds without it.
1188,I'd have to go off my current medications and just take what they give me for I'm not sure how long.
1189,"A friend of mine is on this medication at the moment, a combination of Zyprexa and Tranquilex, are any of you on the same?"
1190,He'd been on some medication in the psych ward that he said was an antidepressant.
1191,"I don't feel like he'd be open to treatment, assuming it's just going to put him on medication to make him ""not himself"" (I hear him arguing already)."
1192,I have been telling people for the last couple years that I am medication free.
1193,I now feel very bad that I led others to believe that it is possible to be schizophrenic without medications.
1194,"i have not started any meds yet, i asked my doctor if i could do my own research on what i thought would help me the most and she seemed open to it."
1195,"I regularly take my medication, been doing so for over 5 years, but while they work (kinda, for the most part), I still struggle every day."
1196,My mother is incredibly against me taking medication for my Schizophrenia.
1197,SO I want to get off this medication that is stabilizing me very well..
1198,"He admitted himself to a hospital for 5 days, during which time the doctor pulled him off all the medications because they suspected it may make him worse."
1199,"Right now we are taking a more cautious approach to his medication plan, slowly putting him on an atypical antipsychotic to try to get his severe intrusive thoughts and the hallucinations under control."
1200,"My psychiatrist said it's by taking my meds, and maybe that's right."
1201,If they're gone because of the medication they won't be suffering anymore.
1202,"Also, meds deal with negative symptoms too, right?"
1203,"He has been off meds for about a month or so and he has gained energy, lost weight, and his negative symptoms are improving too-he's more talkative than before."
1204,"It's odd he is doing so well, I was nervous when he told me he was going to stop taking meds."
1205,He was doing really well managing his schizophrenia with medication but then it seemed like he started changing.
1206,I just recently found out that he stopped taking his medication and believes he is cured but that God talks to him.
1207,"While they are changing my boyfriend's medications while he is in the hospital, should I ask him to ask if he has Schizo-Bi Polar?"
1208,"Now to my actual question--I hear voices, a lot, even though I'm on anti-psychotic medication."
1209,"The book tells the story of how he fell in-love on a psychiatric ward, whilst detailing the horrors of medication addiction and severe mental illness."
1210,"I'm of course going to stay on my meds, call my psychiatrist, pharmacy, everyone tomorrow to ensure I get more of my meds before the weekend."
1211,"If he has undiagnosed mental illness and is not getting proper treatment, is not on medications, and is self medicating (with alcohol, drugs, etc) then is this just a disaster waiting to happen?"
1212,My doctor talked to me about some new researches (in Canada I think) that show that certain alzheimer's medication can improve the concentration.
1213,I might start to take the medication and will update you guys with it
1214,I'm scared it is going to get worse and if I dont get put on some sort of medication I am going to start seeing full on hallucinations every day.
1215,I refuse to be put in a hospital or on meds.
1216,Now it helps me to be comfortable in my mind (i do not recommend it as medication esp.
1217,I remained without medication for about 8 months since the diagnosis was made.
1218,"I was taking the highest dose possible of a typical anti-psychotic called Clopixol - it was horrible, caused high lethargy, tiredness, and lots of secondary negative symptoms (basically, negative symptoms being indirectly caused by medication, due to tiredness, etc)."
1219,"I'm much happier now than during the previous years, and my mental capacity went up as I started taking meds (I feared that it would drop and I would degenerate mentally) - this showed itself in the grades - I'm among the top of my class."
1220,"I've changed medications too many times to count, as everything they put me on has really bad side effects, most notably ""zombification."""
1221,I started taking meds in my early 20s when I started getting debilitating panic attacks.
1222,"I have tried anti psychotic medication and it has absolutely no benefit to me, I tell this to my doctor and he thinks that I should try a different anti-psychotic as I'm not living up to my 'potential""."
1223,"It's extremely frustrating that they keep trying to give me this medication as I can see absolutely no benefit in taking it, and when I take it, it gives me no benefit."
1224,"My doctor has tried numerous medicines for me over the last year and half, but nothing has been able to control my symptoms for long."
1225,If my current medicines (800mg seraquel adn 30 mg haldol) don't work out she is going to try me on clozapine.
1226,"I read this article: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/13/opinion/the-schizophrenia-penalty-.html?_r=0

It is about stigma and medication in America and I was shocked from what I read."
1227,"Another thing, in Lebanon the government doesn't subsidise the price of medication and I am not talking about generics."
1228,So these are the international prices for the meds.
1229,Is it wrong I know it's probably true that's a lot of it is because of the ADHD but it's my life and my problems don't I have to find a way to deal with them I'm already on as much medicine as possible for my problems and taking it or not taking it doesn't make much of a difference I feel like if I blame myself I can't motivate myself over my problems but that just makes me depressed I feel like I'm wasting my life and I don't really care about that so much but my family put a lot of time money effort and feelings into raising me so I feel like if I don't make something out of myself I'm letting them down.
1230,It goes away with medication.
1231,But I'm not on enough meds right now and this is how I feel.
1232,"I am on medication and I still hear voices..The meds zombie me out most of the time and its very hard to motivate...My mom owns A cleaning business, she always asks me if I want to help her for extra money...I never feel like it and sit home feeling like A loser...Today I forced myself to go  and after we where done I actually felt human for A minute...My life would be so much easier if I could work part time, I want to be dependable like I use to be...I have been sick for 2 years before that I work my entire adult life and never had A problem...I know I am not alone in feeling this way I guess I am just feeling sorry for myself....Thanks for listening :/"
1233,"I have taken meds before, but they completely changed who i am as a person."
1234,"The person my family, friends, and fiance all know and love would be gone if i went back to meds."
1235,Since then there are no meds being taken and no counseling.
1236,I was put under a conservatorship with him because I refused to take medication.
1237,"I thought they were thoughts, I thought everyone had that angel/devil thing going on..

To shorten this, in my teen years I tried all available antipsychotic meds with none helping."
1238,"(I guess it was suspected but they never told me why these particular meds were being tried) Psychiatric medications and I do not mix well at all; I have bona fide allergic reactions to many and the rest give me severe side effects, I've had stevens-Johnson syndrome already, and some leave me completely unable to walk or speak."
1239,My question is how does a EEG test help determine what medication and doasge I should be on?
1240,"I don't know why I decided to come on Reddit and ask this, but probably because I JUST found a psych today after hours of calling and want help/advice now (and not in the form of medicine.)"
1241,Hospitalized previously for 2 weeks and tried every type of medicine from Lithium to Seroquel.
1242,Off meds/therapy for 2 years until now.
1243,"Though, my years having taken medication, having periods of being institutionalised have given me, if anything, a very cynical view of some ways of handling the mentally ill (as most here could probably agree)."
1244,"My friend (16) had her medicine insured through her mom's work, they just recently (2,5 weeks ago) stopped covering all of her meds and since then she's been without it."
1245,I had my IQ tested on and off my meds.
1246,Has anyone else done anything similar or found themselves completing tasks more slowly on their meds?
1247,"I also get those while on medication, so don't know if the medication induces it."
1248,"To save you from a block of text, I was recently diagnosed with Schizophrenia and am on Seroquel and Benztropines, my positive symptoms are a lot better since I started the meds but my negative and cognitive symptoms are unaffected, I was just wondering if anyone has a ""treatment"" that helps some of the symptoms; I have heard of nicotine and omega-3's and I am unsure if either actually help."
1249,"Anyway, about a year later and on medication, I got my life back together."
1250,Even though on medication I am normal and lead a full and productive life.
1251,"The medicine my last psychiatrist gave me made me way worse, and she kept wanting to wait longer to see if they would work, and i just couldn't function on them."
1252,"I stopped going to her because she scared me, and stopped taking my medication because of a stomach issue i ended up having, but I'm too afraid to talk yi anybody else."
1253,"I'm not sure what meds he's on, but I'd say they aren't working properly."
1254,"The upshot is that he's sick of being here, and although he hasn't looked for a job in this area, he's going to move across the country and probably stop taking any meds and we are afraid that if he does this, we will never see him again."
1255,"I have trouble remembering to eat, take medication, shower, anything."
1256,"In the past, I've had great success taking the medication Tegretol, but now they refuse to prescribe it to me because I'm not schizophrenic."
1257,"My daily life is so broken, even with antidepressants, anxiety, and focus related medications."
1258,"*[EDIT] If I tell them that I use opiates daily (which is the biggest factor in being able to act sociable more easily) they will kick me out of the program with no medication, and they're the only place here with a sliding scale I can afford."
1259,They won't let me use a medication that has been successful in the past because of this.
1260,He's not under any psychiatric medication...
1261,They explicitly told me she cannot have her medication removed until she is evaluated in the future.
1262,"Now that Jill is out of the clinic Mary wants to make her stop the meds, and do a water only fasting."
1263,My therapist suggested I look into other medications that I haven't taken before.
1264,"I understand that different medicines work for different people, but I don't even know where to start."
1265,"He's back again after his latest episode, and is reluctantly accepting help and meds, albeit at a very slow rate."
1266,"In the past, he has either been on meds for a little longer a period before coming to live with us, or he was more open to a long term situation at the time."
1267,"After hospitalisation and medication, I got depressed and went back to drug use pretty quickly."
1268,"Gain 100 lbs from medications
6."
1269,"As of a few months ago, I stopped taking the medication regularly as my depression was easing off."
1270,"Hi, does anyone here feel like they adapt to their meds in a few months?"
1271,"I've been treated with Haldol injections for around 1.5 months, nd since then I experience the following effects: 

1) No libido and very weak orgasm
2) Total anhedonia, the most worriesome is musical anhedonia, I can't listen to music anymore, it does nothing for me

I've already talked to several people about it who've been treated with APs and they experience the post-effects up to a year after stopping medication."
1272,Is there any chance of coming back to normal after these meds?
1273,I've been off all meds for 3 months now.
1274,He was regularly seeing a psychiatrist around age 16-20 but he stopped taking his medication at around 17.
1275,The meds are working.
1276,I wanna go off my meds.
1277,"I have medication I can take that sometimes knocks me out, but I can't always talk myself into taking it."
1278,"I take all my meds and meet with my psychiatrist regularly, but there is still, say, 10% of me that believes that I don't have schizophrenia."
1279,my symptoms are getting worse and i just started on a new medication a couple weeks ago and the abilify isn't working.
1280,i was wondering if anyone has any advice cause I've been living without meds for a few years and i was able to control it but now im starting to slip and i just wanted a little advice?
1281,"We can't figure out if she's been taking her medication she got from the hospital, if she's been taking her original medication, or if she even got medication from the hospital, they won't tell us."
1282,"She's resistant to wanting to go to therapy, she's constantly lying about what she's doing, what she's thinking, and whether or not she's taken her medication."
1283,But the medication makes me sleepy.
1284,"Okay, so I know its incredibly stupid to come off meds without a doctors go ahead or supervision, but I accidentally came off my meds a few days ago (Seroquel) and I'm not doing so bad, the meds were working, which is good, but I wonder how long I can last before I relapse into the illness again... What if I never get ill again?"
1285,"I mean, do I need the meds?"
1286,I'm not even sure if I even need meds...
1287,"Hi, regular poster here and I was wondering if it was possible to recover from schizophrenia without meds."
1288,Btw I think he still on his meds.
1289,My hallucinations have also gotten somewhat worse since I've been diagnosed because I'm scared to take my new medication..
1290,Im on meds but I still get low-scale hallucinations fairly frequently.
1291,Well shes hearing the voices daily even with medicine...
1292,I think shes on the wrong medicine.
1293,There is other medicines then just one correct?
1294,He started taking Invega injections (he won't take oral meds) a month ago.
1295,"I'm worried about the side effects of these medications, but I want him to get as much help as he can."
1296,I've been on medication for years.
1297,"I've started seroquel as my new med, I've been on it for a month and a bit, and I've been starting to get a bit better but now it feels like symptoms still breakthrough and they're doing it a lot harder now, are meds just a false hope, I was pretty much better for a week and a half (maybe 2) and it feels like everything is coming back, especially paranoia (not so much the people inside my head)."
1298,I think meds are just a false hope... no point in them now.
1299,I'm only on Risperidone at the moment and I hate the thought of extreme weight gain with meds.
1300,These meds were nice and all but I hated how they made me feel.
1301,"I'm afraid of taking my meds again, I'm afraid of going back to the hospital, and I'm terrified of whats happening to me."

1305,But now that I'm on such a low dose of meds the voices are back.
1306,Do I just wait for my injection medicine while I have to listen to these whispers all alone?
1307,"Edit: also as my username suggests, Ive turned to self medication and failed horribly."
1308,I am extremely worried for him because he still seems so out of it (even with medications) I feel like I don't know what to do.
1309,"I started Clozapine but that made me wet the bed every other night so I immediately got off and now I'm off meds completely, just for a week now.. my doctor thought that as safe I suppose or he wouldn't have done it."

1315,"Lately I've noticed that some of my ADHD symptoms have been coming back (I was predominantly inattentive), so I've been thinking about going back to my psychiatrist and asking if I can go back on medication for that also but the only problem is that the stimulant medication was the only meds that worked for me and as you know, stimulants can cause psychosis."

1317,"We chalked it up to immaturity and bad behavior, but he has recently been officially diagnosed and is (supposed to be) taking meds."
1318,The doctor has increased his medication and he's been taking them for the last 7 days but no effect.

1320,"I keep having second thoughts about medication, thinking I should quit taking them."

1322,And I need my medication.
1323,"I've been hearing my mother call my name, my brother who doesn't live here talking to me; I've even had two conversations with people who weren't even there after I took my medication."

1328,"So I was bored and decided to ask people online if they were stuck on an island with a schizophrenic off their meds and a rapist and they had to trust one to get off, who would they trust."
1329,"First things first, there is a message by some advanced beings (I don't 100% know who they are, but I think they are advanced humans from the future) that are sending us ALL a message warning us of the tragedies that we can prevent if we just stand up as one together and fight the tyrants of today, except there is one thing, the neo mkultra group/project is intercepting that message and giving us bad thoughts so that we all get seen by psychiatrists (now I'm not saying psychiatrists know about this, but some probably do) and they give us medication so we shut up, some hospitals might even implant a thing into our brain to slow release anti psychotics and we can never come out of them, this is sad for these people (DO NOT think this happened to you, because it most likely did not, this just happens to a very few and select people)."

1339,It actually helped with hallucinations for a few hours each day but when the medicine wore off they started to creep back again.
1340,I'm pretty fucked because without the meds I will go get into lots of trouble but to quit treatment would forego any hospitalization.
1341,"I had no problems doing an extensive routine while on medication,  but struggle with the basics off medication."
1342,Refusing his meds and now he is psychotic.

1351,"I've had a psychotic episode that lasted 2 days:

* auditive hallucination (hospital sounds I've never heard before in my life)
* smelled like hospital medicine or something; when I approached people that probably had a sweet smelling perfume it would smell like lavender room spray
* made me freak out, I thought I was in a coma in reality

It stopped after 2 days."
1352,"I've had an other one that lasted 1 day(4 months later):

* smelled like incense, Initially I freaked out thinking I'm in hell, but I stopped thinking that because it would've caused some terrible paranoid decisions

Then it stopped (again, without taking medicine) then I went to see the doctor again, took zyprexa for 6 months till this day and I'm still taking it."
1353,I am also now on medication.
1354,"Most people think that dating bipolar people who are not on medication is an extremely bad idea, and I agree with this."
1355,"I do not think I would date an unmedicated woman either, but I also know that a lot of the medications have quite severe side effects that could make the bipolar person emotionally unresponsive and dull, which is still better than being off meds but much worse than a neurotypical person."

1363,"Though he seems more stable in there, he quits taking his meds the day he gets out of the hospital."
1364,"We've been able to get him to take his meds for about 3 whole weeks almost 2.5 years ago, and were lucky now to have him take them 2 days in a row when he actually agrees to get prescribed them."
1365,"He refuses all medication except marijuana and occasionally a 'benzo', except every time he gets marijuana, he believes its been tampered with."
1366,"(I think this is bc he doesn't get a desired result, so someone had to have messed with it) All other medications he's convinced will kill him quickly."
1367,He thinks has anxiety and refuses all treatment and medications.
1368,"They've tried multiple medications on her, and nothing seems to work."
1369,"I'm just so done, it is so hard to remember to take my medicine, I have a pill sorter things that has a lot of colors on it."
1370,How do you remind yourself to take your medicine?

1372,"I can´t take my meds, because I can´t afford them and because my finances are so bad that I want to donate blood, which I can´t while being on meds..."
1373,"These are some studies that I found to help me find out: [Here](http://www.schizophrenia.com/szresearch/archives/001061.html) is a study that suggests nicotine helps with our ability to process information, cognitive function, and reduce the side affects of medication."
1374,He needs to stay at his father's house and take his medication.
1375,"Both my therapist and my physc are aware of this, they've been aware since I had to go to a partial program in October because I was seriously thinking of killing myself (wherein they changed my meds to a relatively high dose of Effexor and something I cant remember the name of for sleep."
1376,"He had NO symptoms during the day (now that his medications are straightened out) but smoking causes him to be more delusional (as in the tv and music is speaking specifically to him) and hear some of the voices again, so I'm not sure it's a great trade off."
1377,He was under various medications (small doses) for the past two years.
1378,We realize he needs to be under medication all his life but is there hope that he can take care of himself?
1379,Anyone have a similar experience with meds?
1380,I stopped taking medicine for my anxiety and depression (Cymbalta and Vistaril) because Cymbalta gave me the shits and made me feel drunk while Vistaril made me sleepy.
1381,"I called a hotline and they sent emergency response people who basically said I can't get any help or be evaluated without parent consent and they don't want me to since they think medicine will make me ""slow""."
1382,I'm patiently waiting to gradually have my meds reduced and am hoping to one day be completely off meds and not have any symptoms.
1383,He has told me that he is schizophrenic and takes his meds every morning and every night.
1384,"Since then, she has put on a considerable amount of weight, became very depressed and started taking medication to battle her problems."

1387,I have a friend in his early 20's who suddenly stopped taking his medication without informing his doctors.
1388,What can I do to convince him to go back on his medications and stay on them?
1389,I talked to my psychiatrist today about it and he said it could be a side effect from the medication I'm on or my illness.
1390,"It seems like a lot of what I read shows that professionals don't know the difference on many issues whether it's a side effect of the medication or the illness, but shouldn't they know."
1391,"I feel so lonely, really lonely, I never felt it this bad before the meds well, I actually liked being lonely before."
1392,"I think the meds are making me agitated and restless and ugh, just, worse?"
1393,"For those of you who have taken meds or are on them now, how well do they work?"
1394,"My symptoms have been worse lately, but I'm also starting a new job in September so I don't know if now's a good time to try out a new medication, especially if it requires a blood test once a week."
1395,"After her layoff, my mom offered to pay for her health insurance but she said she was feeling great and didn't need medication."
1396,She stopped taking the medications and then the spiral continued.
1397,I want to help my aunt and I feel that she should take the medications that turned her back to her normal self.
1398,"But even then I don't want anyone to know it besides a few people
I'm not sure what I want
I want to not pretend but if I weren't what would be the point I mean hell
But at the same time people don't understand me like they think I'm fine or I'll get better but I'm barely able to hide how much I want to shout and scream and break things and kick and punch and shit and it's not changing and if it were to start to or I'd have to take medicine or something I'd go crazy I can't live like that"
1399,She is refusing all her medications and and is starting to slip medically.
1400,My wife has POA for health issues so hopefully we can force her to take meds.

1402,"I'm not any medication at the moment, much too scared to be on anti-psychotics."
1403,Do you think it has something to do with medication?
1404,"I am not sure how well the medications are working, I hear voices inside and outside, however, I hear the inside voices much less frequently."
1405,"This is aided by the fact that I do not own a firearm, and I am not given large doses of medication."

1413,Does anyone know of successful treatment options that don't involve medication?
1414,I stopped taking the meds because I didn't like how stupid they made me feel.
1415,"The first thing they told me was that, since I've tried so many medications and have been hospitalized so many times I probably need residential care."
1416,Im going to get put on meds today too.
1417,"How do I function, given meds aren't an option yet?"
1418,"She asked me what meds I'm on and if I'd like to stay on them or follow a ""rigorous health balance holistic approach."""
1419,"I think if I could stay on meds AND do holistic it might be worth it, especially if I can get off these anti-psychotis..."
1420,"I'm terrified of taking meds for my disorder, since when I did my weight got over 400 pounds (my schizophrenic cousin did as well and died of heart failure), and I couldn't even think or function (I'm 200 pounds lighter now)."

1422,"I can't cope with all this, but I can't deal with the side-effects of the meds."
1423,Can anyone give me some tips or meds recommendations for reducing neg symptoms?
1424,"Even though my symptoms have been reduced greatly by medication to the point where I can function normally, I still have some flashbacks to the delusions (and other beliefs) I used to have/still have."
1425,"I'm undiagnosed something, I don't have the money for a doctor or medication, and I'm really too full of myself to degrade my own image to ask for advice from people that know me."
1426,But the thing is I wanna be off meds when I do it.
1427,"I wanna be off meds for good, and I think changing my diet, exercising at least once a week since now I do nothing, could really change and help me."
1428,The worst part of my meds is that they increase appetite or make me gain weight as its own side effect.
1429,"That's a big part of why I want to stop meds, that and the side effect of throwing up after I take them every now and then."
1430,I haven't been very consistent with my meds lately.
1431,Then I'm gonna try and get the psychiatrist to agree with me that this is worth a shot to try without meds.
1432,"If anyone has experienced therapy, hospitilization, medications, that have helped you please give me advice because I hate visiting home now and as cold as it may seem it feels as though she died when she started having episodes because as a person she is broken."
1433,"A friend of mine whom I have known for around a decade has recently been going through some major depression, abusing alcohol (while on medication) and contemplating suicide has recently been scaring me with his actions."
1434,"TL;DR: I don't think medication should be the ONLY tool my SO is using, but our therapist doesn't seem to be decent enough to prescribe cognitive treatments/exercises and acts more like a confessional that throws out positive affirmations occasionally."
1435,I just really want to know what has worked for you or a loved one BEYOND medication.
1436,"I don't think medication is enough, but unless we can afford to pay like $100-200 a session, I can't seem to find a therapist for him that agrees with me."
1437,"He is under care of a ""professional"" and on psychiatrist prescribed medication, so I'm not seeking this advice as his only treatment plan."
1438,"A friend has schizophrenia, has been previously committed for a week, was on medication but stopped taking it."
1439,"He refuses to take medicine or go to therapy, and any time we suggest anything like that, he becomes more distant and distrustful of us."
1440,"Me, I'm not that kind, nowadays I use an injection type of medicine monthly and I used to think in my hardcore psychosis that I have telepathic abilities and superpowers like an ability to manipulate people etc but I was a lot on drugs in my past and drugs triggered my schizophrenia."
1441,"I'm on a number of medications, mentionably Risperidone, Divaloprex, and Lamictal."
1442,I am constantly being switched on and off medications and unrelenting paranoia is not reason enough to drop out and seek full-time help.
1443,"I was wondering that because the medications used for schizophrenia right now aren't exactly the best (albeit they are better than the very old style antipsychs), do you think they'll be new antipsychotics in the next 10-15 years, or are there already some in the making?"
1444,"I'm not as in control as I was on the meds, but I seem to be safe for society for the time being."
1445,"Especially being on the medicine, how will they know if I'm nearly symptomless because of the medicine."
1446,My questions are:  (1) Can she refuse to take medication?
1447,I think with my medicine I'm becoming more aware.
1448,"For those who do not take medication (if anyone) or are medicated, what are some control techniques you use?"
1449,"I don't know if it's side effects of medication, because these happen so often."
1450,I feel as though the meds are working to good and i want to hear my voices and have my delusions again!!
1451,With my previous medication (Amisulpride 200mg) I slept 12 hours a day on average.
1452,"I'm on medication now, going on day three of it."
1453,"Here's what gets me, he's dodging the subject of diagnosis and has got me on particular meds."
1454,"The exact description in the warning packet for Risperidone states ""This medicine is an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder"" it also says a doctor may give you it for other reasons though."
1455,Standard (from what I skimmed on here) medication for people with Schizophrenia.
1456,"When I was in high school I got my first job and started supporting her financially by putting food in the fridge for her, now I'm paying for medications, making sure she's bringing up symptom changes with her mental health physician, and still assisting her in other was financially."
1457,"Both of us are really off-put by the idea of a number of reasons (newness, it seems like the new pharma-rep push, the concentration of medication in the bloodstream over the month, how he'll be able to sleep if the medication isn't being taken nightly, if it'll make him a zombie like the seroquel did, etc), and the information I've been reading from clinical trials hasn't really done anything to convince me otherwise."
1458,"So last night I got bored at asked people if they were stuck on an island with a schizophrenic off their meds and a rapist and they had to trust one to get off, who would they trust."
1459,"**Schizophrenic off meds:**

Schizophrenic-3

Rapist-7

**Schizophrenic on meds:**

Schizophrenic-4

Rapist-6

These numbers surprise me and I'm trying to understand this."
1460,It was partly my fault for stopping my medication at times.
1461,"I wanted to believe that I could do well for myself without the help of medication, but it never lasted."
1462,Have any of you ever had trouble affording treatment or medication for this or other issues?
1463,I've been on meds for a while now and have noticed a lack of sexual urges.
1464,"Thanks in advance for any replies

EDIT: The reason his dad is so bad is because he never got any help or medication, we are just afraid that something is boiling inside of him that he cant help but will get worse if he doesn't get any professional help."
1465,"took some meds, and i snapped out of it in a few days."
1466,"i'm not on meds at all, i just needed them to get out of that crazy episode.. and i mean fucking crazy as shit."
1467,"I've been on so many different types of medicines, I first started with Paxil for just anxiety."
1468,"Then a half year later the voices start, now I've been dragged through hell and back mentally, whether it be from all the meds or from the constant shit talking in my head about myself."
1469,"I'm on 800mg of seroquel, 40mg prozac now, each day blurs together more and more and now I just feel like a fucking medicated, sedated useless piece of shit who can't function with or without medication."
1470,She's no longer on any medication.
1471,"She is currently seeing a psychiatrist and is on medication, but is not receiving any additional support."
1472,"**TL;DR - mom has schizophrenia and is on medication, talks out loud to herself especially when upset, can't talk to her or go out with her, what should I do to help her?"
1473,She then said to NOT take any medication they give me.
1474,"he hates us all and refuses to get help because the last time my father took him to get medication he came back thinking that the doctors ""planted more chips"" in his body."
1475,"he needs new meds, or help or something."
1476,"the one time we actually managed to get him to the hospital the doctors said that he was perfectly fine and that the meds should be working, he was sent home with no changes and the behaviour continued to this day."
1477,Bouncing back and forth off of medication.
1478,The reason I went off of my meds is because...well I couldn't do my job on my medication...I was so groggy and out of it on my pills...I do a very physical job.
1479,They gave him medication but one of the side effects was Gynecomastia so he stopped taking his medication.
1480,He doesn't want to go to the hospital or take any kind of medication because he believes there is nothing wrong with himself.
1481,"Did you feel that once you were diagnosed as schizophrenic, finding the right meds got a little easier?"
1482,I have been on meds for most of my life and nothing seems to help.
1483,"They halted all treatment, medications, contacts."
1484,"About five months ago, I went off of my meds because I started to not enjoy things."
1485,I'm sure he's on medication and he lives with a very loving and supporting family.
1486,I reminded her to take her medicine and she tells me she does (but my sis who lives with her says she doesn't take it).
1487,"I said ""No, Ma, but I really think you should take your medicine""."
1488,"This morning I felt myself come out of it, and shortly after it was time to take my meds again."
1489,"So far, it is working better than the other meds I've been on."
1490,My fiance got put on the Invega Sustenna injection three months ago because he was refusing medication.
1491,"They moved him to another facility, and I've been told that no meds seem to be working on him at this point- that he's agitated and ""very heavily sexually preoccupied""."
1492,"When I expressed my concern that he was having symptoms despite his medication, and that I thought Invega was causing problems, his psychiatrist insisted that he just needed time to adjust to it, and if I was concerned, he would prescribe oral Invega as a supplemental medication."
1493,"It was a slow start but we eventually found some medications that worked for me, the hallucinations and paranoia had subsided, but a couple of days ago I had an episode and it all came back to me."
1494,"The doctor told me the medication would reduce the voices and once I saw the cause and effect of the medication, I believed my doctor."
1495,These meds make me so tired and all I can hear in my head is what poison it is and how I need to never take them again.
1496,"I came across a site which recommends supplements for helping out with the side effects of antipsychotics: http://bettermedicine.info

I noticed that they recommend Tongkat Ali for a better libido."
1497,Does anyone else feel completely normal on their medications?
1498,"However, the alien in my head is warning me about being off my meds."
1499,He implying that it's irresponsible for me to be running around with a free mind and that I would get in so much trouble with the mental health review board because of something I might do while off my meds.
1500,"Like, what is wrong with going about your life off meds with an alien in your head messing around with you?"
1501,"Also, meds don't get rid of the alien."
1502,"So again, what's the point of meds?"
1503,"Though, I've done some more research and I stumbled upon 'secondary schizophrenia' which seems more plausible, for that schizophrenia-like manifestation of symptoms can stem beyond just biological underpinnings; but with medication or illicit substance use, and which more likely for me is environmental stress."
1504,"Nevertheless without continuous medication-taking currently, I am doing significantly a lot better in terms of overall cognitive functioning, coherency and perception-wise speaking."
1505,She had quit taking her meds and became violent.
1506,I'm planning a course of action as her son... but she may even too paranoid to even trust me to get her to take the medication.

1513,"So far, we’ve had minimal luck getting her help and after long bouts of convincing her to seek medical attention, she takes medications for a day or two and then stops returning back to the state of crying and screaming for the duration of the day (among other things)."
1514,"They only time I do read is when I am tired from medication adjustment, or psychotic and scared of something."
1515,"However, my family does not want to risk me being in the house without medicine affecting me, so I need to be somewhere away from home for a while when I'm off the abilify."
1516,I need to stop taking the meds and see if the damage from the weed/speed has been permanent.
1517,He is in meds.
1518,The medication I'm on is Singulair which is used to prevent asthma/allergies.
1519,"I'm on meds for the delusions, and I'm getting better at dealing with it so its faded from what it was, but in social situations I sometimes get thrown back into it."
1520,My psychiatrist hates me because I never take my meds because of this denial (why take meds for something that isn't there?!)
1521,and maybe I should go back to psychiatrist and get back on meds but not if none of this is real illness...
1522,"Since then, he's had a number of what you might call ""psychotic breaks"" (all of which correlate with him coming off his medication and restarting weed smoking.)"
1523,"Moral of the story, don't smoke weed when you're unstable and not on meds"
1524,"I've had a psychotic episode that lasted 2 days:

* auditive hallucination (hospital sounds I've never heard before in my life)
* smelled like hospital medicine or something; when I approached people that probably had a sweet smelling perfume it would smell like lavender room spray
* made me freak out, I thought I was in a coma in reality

It stopped after 2 days."
1525,"I've had an other one that lasted 1 day(4 months later):

* smelled like incense, Initially I freaked out thinking I'm in hell, but I stopped thinking that because it would've caused some terrible paranoid decisions

Then it stopped (again, without taking medicine) then I went to see the doctor again, took zyprexa for 6 months till this day and I'm still taking it."
1526,I gained about 13kg on my medication.
1527,The mainline medication is Abilify 10mg daily now.
1528,He offered me cash (we live together) for my anxiety and my pain meds.

1532,"I told him that if he loves me, as much as he says he does (we have been talking marriage).. that he would say, ""Baby, ease your suffering with YOUR medicine""."

1536,"He happily discussed medicine with my mother, as I was crying in the back seat, with Jack right in my ear."
1537,So I have been on meds for about a week now.
1538,"My therapist said otherwise and said to go see a psychiatrist and get officially diagnosed (been seeing her five years and have been concerned about positive symptoms for a year)
I have taken meds before with bad side effects and she said i manage the illness well
Any advice?"
1539,I'm worried meds will diminish my ability to play and improvise music on the guitar but i can look back and see how the illness effects my ability to function.
1540,"I feel much better with medication, but I suffer from affective blindness."

1543,I stopped taking my meds yesterday because I decided I wanted to hear their message that I can't while on meds.
1544,"They have something important to say to me, I know it, but I can't hear them with the meds, it's poision to their words."
1545,"More precisely, as medications and other treatments are being developed, are the psychiatrists/other scientists monitoring patients subjectively to see if there is improvement/change during treatment testing?"
1546,Could monitoring these wavelets and their change before and after medication show whether the medication is working?
1547,He returned after a few years (after wandering many cities as a destitute) and refuses to take any medication.
1548,"Since he is paranoid, he suspects the relatives mix medicines in his food and inspects it thoroughly before consuming."
1549,Is there a way to convince him about medication being good for him?
1550,He is calmer when he takes medicines.
1551,I was also(for like a month) under the impression that all of the meds I am on(abilify and certraline) are placebos considering they don't seem to be working at all and I am just as bad as I was when all this started a year and a bit ago(I am 17 now).
1552,She accuses me of stealing her food and of bringing strange men into my room at night to rape her... She's generally well-kempt and she's on medication but I don't know how many more nights I can go without sleep because she's so verbal and noisy.

1554,"Within 24 hours of being admitted and on whatever medication they had her on she began to come out of it, feel extreme regret at stopping her medication and was very apologetic."
1555,When she is medicated she is aware of the illness and 100% clear that she does not want to be off her meds and always regrets going off them when she relapses.
1556,She's supposed to be taking a synthetic thyroid medication daily but we're not completely convinced that she does.
1557,"I'm trying to convince my husband that his mother needs professional help, and that if we get her on the right medicine regime that there is STILL HOPE FOR HER!"

1566,"I am taking medication for anxiety and depression, and both conditions have improved greatly, possibly as a result of the meds or just from time/changes in circumstances."

1568,I'm trying to be more alert when I wake up so I'm having dinner earlier around 6:00 and taking meds around 9:00pm.
1569,"Some of these things have lessened since I've been on the meds, but others are still there, and I didn't tell my doctor about most of it because all of it (except the hypochondria and fixation on weird scenarios) seemed normal."
1570,"He refuses to take his medication properly because ""it makes him feel like a vegetable""."

1576,How long do you lot sleep for and what medication do you take?

I am diagnosed with schizophrenia and severe mood swings (although they go hand in hand a lot I've heard), and my psychiatrist gave me Olanzapina for medication."

1580,"Weed has been my medication to cure my depression for years now I'm constantly depressed and annoyed, extremely anoyed."
1581,I wish there was some medication that could make me feel so aware and alive without all the psycho delusions.
1582,Then I went off both meds and soon had another- scarier belief.
1583,"I gradually feel at ease with this, sometimes believing ,sometimes not, but I just carry on
(What makes me question the realty is from taking meds that vanished past beliefs)

Thank you for reading, I just needed to vent."

1585,They apparently cannot get any more medicine because their psychiatrist is not around and only they can prescribe them more.

*insomnia, although this could be due to my ADHD medication
*I read somewhere that ""movement is sped up."

1592,When they got there they asked to see the medicine and told me that they weren't going to force me to take it.
1593,"If anyone has any idea to why I experienced what I did, whether they think it was from quitting smoking and my medicine, I would appreciate the input."

1627,"I'm tired of missing school, and I'm tired of somewhat reduced concentration while on this medication (not sure whether it's due to the illness or the medication, though), so I want to try Abilify, which I heard doesn't cause sedation in most cases and increases cognitive abilities such as concentration and overall academic achievement, at least based on the case study I've read."
1628,"I miss lots of classes, can't do my homework on time (because I sleep all the time) and have reduced personal time due to the sedation caused by this medication."
