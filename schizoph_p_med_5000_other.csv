I'm seriously considering going to one. I need a sort of plan in case things do not improve for me.  I can't go to the local p-ward. I don't see myself  getting better  in just a week or two. Plus they told me that I would be sent to state if I ended back there anyways.  

I haven't been to a *""psychiatric only""* hospital since I was a child 13 and I've had to work hard to paint over the memories of that trauma. I've had crappy p-ward stays  but my last few were actually awesome and I could see myself making good use out of time spent recovering in a better suited facility. Especially if it has grounds to walk on and a good staff and more things to do than a p-ward.

Are there hospitals in NY that have Nice grounds to walk on and best therapy? I don't want to be in a heavily locked down ward or confined to a room. I don't want to feel like I made a mistake and then get treated bad or neglected or hurt. I could see myself hurting myself really bad. I would really freak out and end up nowhere. 

Yeah I'm asking for help because I don't know what to do.  I need to hear that it would be ok if I did this because I really need help and have no one or even a doctor or any meds. I would be willing to drive to the hospital or take a bus or something. This option is really might be the last thing between me and disaster. I wish I could talk to someone about what's the matter. This loneliness is destroying me.

So I have this really good friend who comes from a somewhat broken home, as a result she has spent a ton of time at my house or going on family vacations with us. She's more like a sister to me now. She's always dealt with severe ADHD and depression to some extent, but other than being a little spacey, she seemed pretty mentally grounded. There have been some incidents that worry me, were were camping one time and she left the RV to go outside. She didn't come back for a while so we went looking and found her sitting on a swing, she had this wide eyed stare and was extremely unresponsive to words, we tried rousing her by nudging her a little bit, but it was to no avail, it was like she had been hypnotized. After almost an hour, she started responding to us somewhat coherently, we took her back and put her to bed, but she had very little recollection of what had happened. She seemed better after that, and there were no more episodes like that. After a year or so things got worse, she spiraled pretty deep into depression that characterized itself by this complete lack of any emotion and she attempted to slit her wrists a few times, I thought that she just went into depressive phases, but she described it as a compulsion to hurt herself, like some power or entity was exerting their will over her. She had smoked some pot with me on a couple of occasions, and what I initially recognized as the paranoia of someone who had never smoked quickly spiraled out of control. She ran terrified away from me and my brother, with the look of a caged animal in her eyes, she crawled underneath the foundation of my house and was screaming for god to save her. We got her out and calmed her down, but I remember her sobbing like a helpless child who just experienced something terrifying. I resolved not to let her smoke after that. Right now she's been hospitalized for almost a week after she had another compulsion to kill herself, felt as if she could not fight against it anymore, and asked her family to take her to the hospital. She's being held there for a week, psychoanalysis is my guess, and is not allowed to see anyone but family.


I want to know how I can help make her feel more comfortable and happy, I've noticed in the last few months how destructive her battle with mental illness has been to her self esteem. She feels guilty about it I think, she is often apologetic about the way she feels and thinks, she seems to view herself as defective or wrong in some way. I tell her that she should never have to apologize for how she feels, but I don't know if I'm getting through to her. I can't imagine that being examined by doctors for a whole week I'd going to make her feel much like a human, and I just want to know what I can do for her other than just continue to be a friend to her and not to treat her like some kind of oddity. I just hate seeing her destroyed by her own feelings, and then on top of that destroyed by other people and their expectations, their unquestioning acceptance of what they perceive, their conviction that they or somebody else knows best.


On some limited level I think I can relate, I've done a lot of drugs, in particular LSD and psilocybin, altered states of consciousness and neurochemistry have always interested me. I view the brain as nothing more than a complex machine made of neurons, synaptic pathways, powered by an array of chemicals, and tuned in always to the stimuli around us that are filtered through the nervous system and sensory organs. Introduce a minute amount of some novel psychoactive chemical, and watch the reality around you crumble. This leaves me with the view that there is nothing wrong with having a different experience of ""objective reality"" which I'm not sure I even believe in, but that mostly what my friend suffers from is the isolating experience of perceiving or thinking differently from others. Although I see that some of the psychological phenomenon that she experiences are scary to her in their own right, and that is not to be ignored. Whatever she needs, be that medication or psychotherapy, I hope she gets, and I hope it helps her. I just hate to see her treated differently, although I recognize that suicidal people do have to treated differently to some extent, I can't stand to see her made to feel like less of a valuable or loved person because of how isolating her experience is. To her sense of self worth and happiness destroyed, because of the arrogant and single minded postulations of others, that because they don't experience life in a strictly comparable way to the majority, they are labeled as crazy or sick. I understand that in psychopathology that a disorder is only viewed as that because it inhibits leading a happy or functional life. But at the same time I feel that much of that dysfunction comes from the typical view of someone who experiences reality differently, and that because that persons experience differs from theirs it frightens them. /end somewhat incoherent rant.


I see a psychologist too, and I can relate very much to feeling isolated from others, sometimes for reasons that are the same as hers, as well as some reasons that are my own. I know what it's like to feel like less of a person because of who you are, I can even relate to not perceiving reality the same as others most of the time, but I did a lot of, and still do, drugs sometimes. I'm not a psychologist, I just want to help my friend.",['attr'],0,neu_vader

Please see a doctor or mental health professional if you think you experience any of the symptoms here.*

From the current **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition** (DSM-5):

**Schizophrenia 295.90 (F20.9)**

A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):

    1. Delusions.
    2. Hallucinations.
    3. Disorganized speech (eg, frequent derailment or incoherence)
    4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.
    5. Negative symptoms (ie, diminished emotional expression or avolition).

B. For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relationships, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning).

C. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less, if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (ie, active phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodomal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbances may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (eg, odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).

D. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.

E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (eg, a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.

F. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated).

She says she thinks she's had it most her life however her hallucinations really got out of control when she was around 15 years old. She has auditory, visual, and occasionally textile hallucinations. As a child our mother says she was always talking to imaginary friends. She remembers seeing weird things on rare occasion but around 15 it got out of control. She started failing all her classes, sleeping all the time she wasn't at school, had no friends, and ate only candy bars and soda (she lost a lot of weight as she only had one a day). She started to talk about seeing ghosts and would scare the crap out of me. Eventually she became very suicidal and was hospitalized twice in a few months for extended amounts of time. She was eventually was diagnosed as bipolar and released from the hospital. She took lithium for less than two months. She was supposed to get follow up care but my mother never did that for her. 

Fast forward to 14 years later and we are now adults. My sister has not talked about these ghosts she used to see since she was 16. I assumed they were hallucinations brought on by bipolar psychosis and that she no longer sees them. She is a normal stay at home mom of two kids. She lives a normal life now with no doctors or medication. You would never know this about her. But she did confess to me that she still sees them. All the time every day. They never went away but when she was 16 she simply stopped talking about them because she didn't like how no one believed her. She said she also stopped interacting with them which made the ""ghosts"" less abundant and less aggressive. These days if she sees them she does not look at them. If they talk to her she ignores them. She finds that when she talks to them they come around more and get more aggressive and demand more of her attention. 
When she was younger she was convinced they were spirits. Some lost souls, some demons, some she called judgers. But as an adult she is now atheist and believes they are hallucinations brought on my schizophrenia. She isn't absolutely convinced this is the case though because she says they sometimes know information she had no way of knowing. 

Her hallucinations are almost completely of these ""ghosts"". She says most of them look human, some with deformities or injuries. She says that though they look human it's obvious they aren't because look duller than the world around them. The light in the room doesn't reflect off them. Sometimes they glow. They sort of hover in the air a few inches off the ground. Sometimes they are not human at all but monsters or beasts. These ones usually give her a sense of terror. Some are judgers but she doesn't see those any more. I'll explain judgers later. Most of the ghosts will try to talk to her. They love to talk about themselves (they all have a story of how they lived and died). They will also talk to each other but she can't hear those conversations. She says she can always tell who is talking because the sound will come from their direction. She says she can still hear them just find even if she is at a concert or loud place. They are more populous in big cities. Scary ones are often at parks. She says they are assigned by someone to be where they are and will stay in that place (like house, park, store, ect). She says trying to avoid them when they pop up by leaving the room does not work because if they think you are avoiding them they follow. Sometimes in public they will be preoccupied with something like looking in a store window and won't acknowledge her at all. She says sometimes they can be assigned to follows specific person. She says they will stay around for a few hours to a few weeks. She can talk to them by thought and they will speak back. She can ask them questions and they will answer her or go ask another ""ghost"" for the answer. She says they were often wrong about the questions she would ask ""like winning lotto"" but a few times seemed to know things. They can also show her images in her mind of certain situations or whatever if they want to show her something that happened. She says they can touch her but not the environment. When they touch her it feels cold. They can walk through her. If she touches them her hand goes right through. They never tell her to do bad things or hurt people or herself. They do not criticize here. On rare occasion they will criticize the things people around her say. 

She told me that now she completely ignores them and it makes the occurrences of seeing them a lot less. She doesn't talk to them any more or about them because it makes them show up more and be more aggressive about getting her attention. She says sometimes they can be incredibly beautiful or absolutely terrifying. She still sees them on a daily or weekly basis but now it's usually from a distance and the grocery store or standing on the side of the road she is driving down. Rarely they are in her house or close enough to touch. She does not believe they can hurt her or anyone else.

She says she is not paranoid and does not think anyone is out to get her. Only once has she ever heard a voice where there wasn't a visual ghost attached to it. Twice years ago her reflection disappeared in the mirror and was replaced with something else. Sometimes the ghosts can shoot ribbons of light out of their hands and seem more important. Sometimes the ghosts are just orbs of light that still communicate with her. She says she never feels like media like books or news papers or movies or radio are sending her special messages. Her environment and real people around her never change or anything like that. The hallucinations are strictly with these ""ghosts"".
 
The judgers I mentioned before looked like grim reapers and almost always showed up in pairs. One good, one bad. The bad one wore a black robe and the good had a gold robe. They showed up places like hospitals or car accidents or around people my sister thought were going to die soon. They talked to each other but never her. Their faces look like those decorative porcelain masks and they can take them off. After they remove their face a judgment is made to determine who gets the soul. The winners face would smile and the losers face would cry. 

Like I said, when my sister hit puberty and these hallucinations grew she was convinced she was seeing spirits and demons. She thought she was special. Now, 14 years later she thinks it's much more likely she is schizophrenic. I believe completely she sees these things and feel bad I thought she was lying when were were kids and then chalked it up to psychosis. She hasn't talked about it in so long I honestly thought it was over. But my sister refuses to get help because she doesn't want to be locked up, drugged, or loose her kids. And like I said she lives a completely normal life with random annoyances.  

Also, she can't watch shows like the walking dead as she becomes legit paranoid that a zombie plague is coming. That's the only real paranoia she has.  So what do those of you think? Does she sound like she may have schizophrenia? 

TL;DR my sister sees dead people. ",['conj'],0,neu_vader

The purpose of my theory and practice, is to help individuals suffering from a mental illness, learn that antipsychotics and/or mood stabilizers, only due 50 percent of the work towards recovery. The other 50 percent is solely in the hands of the individual's behavior, including perceptions and thoughts. To prove this theory, it is known that delusional thinking is one of the main contributing factors to schizophrenia. It is also known that while the individual has gained some insights into the working of his own mind, he cannot none the less revert back to that old delusional thought process. I have noticed this fact within my own experience, and have armed myself with constructive behavior. Now how may we define constructive behavior, we can define it as thus: the word constructive denotes the process of developing or advancing something. The word behavior denotes: the aggregate of responses to internal and external stimuli. In a word I am defining behavior modification. It is the process of conditioning behavior. I have also noticed within my own experience that constructive behavior, or behavior modification, can alleviate some of the negative symptoms such as cognitive deficits within mental illness. I have also noticed that some (I hope I'm not offending anyone.) will complain of being inhibited to make the positive action of modifying thier behavior to improve their quality of life. Now while in some cases this may be true, but for the majority of us, it is a matter of self perception and/or self deception.

Last night a friend of mine from another continent phoned out of the blue.  After pleasantries, she revealed she's been having a tough time because she is ""going mad"" (in the English sense) because some things have been happening to her:

* she can psychically (though totally unintentionally!) flip others into their Jungian ""shadow selves"".  For this reason all her friends have begun to shun her -- they're afraid of her ability.
* related to this she is psychically controlling events, and drawing people (and sometimes cars) psychically to herself.  Her proof of this is that people stare at her strangely as they pass and feel the connection.  Cars with important license plates cut her off in traffic.
* she accidentally meditated for two hours, where she lost all pieces of herself
* because of this she believes she might be the second coming of christ.  She joked (?) that the fact that she's 33 has significance.
* she is convinced that everyone at her daughter's school is making snide comments to her, and about her behind her back.  This would be because one of the people who's minds she controlled was a teacher at the school, and is now turning everyone against her.  
* incidentally: she phoned be because she had a dream that I'd abandoned her too, and she worried that she had ""gotten to me"" through her dream.  
* she was convinced she was the subject of a pagan curse so burned so much sage in the house her husband thought she'd been hot boxing.
* she checked herself into hospital because she was sure she was controlling her childrens' minds and felt she was a danger to them psychically.  Her son had begun having ""adult dreams"" and her daughter has been suffering from increased anxiety (over previous levels) since this began.  The hospital gave her some anti-anxiety meds and sent her home after a few hours.
* she has cut off all her ""therapists"" because she's not sure who she can trust.

All of this apparently started a couple of months ago when two things happened at once:

* she began confronting issues of long-term sexual abuse as a child. 
* her daughter decided she did not like her teacher at school, and the previously wonderful school wasn't helpful in solving the problem.  My friend felt betrayed, I think.

The hospitalisation was 2 weeks ago.  She's calmer now (anti-anxiety meds!) but still believes in her psychic powers, and that there's no one on her side, and that the whole school is talking about her.

This woman was, previously, extremely well grounded.  She was a touchstone for me and all her friends of a reasoned approach to life.  And now this!  So --- does this sound schizophrenic?  And if so, she's definitely not getting help, and she sounds like she's losing it!  And I'm on a different continent.  What can I DO?!  Or should I do anything?  Am I over reacting?

Sorry again for posting here if this isn't the correct spot.

I do BJJ, and I really do not want to be so medicated that I can't do the thing I'm living for, a life of working and medication and nothing else is not a life I have the slightest intention of living, that's not life, that's existence.  Same for living with the paranoia.   

My symptoms are mostly just extreme anxiety and paranoia.  It feels like everyone hates me and laughs about me behind my back, and even still I don't feel that it's just in my head.

Well we were just talking and I could see she was not okay. She seemed very tired and kind of down. And I just asked some questions about how she feels and what's wrong and so on.

She told me she doesn't care about herself, just about others and that she doesn't want to affect others in a bad way. She said that she feels tired and she went to the capital city of where we live the day before and I know she loves that city and is going to study there, but today she told me she didn't even want to go there and that she's not really excited to study there in fall.

She also said she is closing in herself.. like she doesn't want to meet new people and be with people but she doesn't want to be alone and wants to be with someone (eg. me) - that's what she told me. Then she said she just feels like she wants to be in her room, get rid of all the mirrors in her room and just lay down all day.

I am very concerned for her and I told her if she could imagine all she said written down, how would it feel. She said she doesn't know, to me it feels very depressing and depressed though.

Also she should be going to Italy next week and she spent so much time talking to me about how she loves Rome and wants to spend a weekend there and so on and so on, and she got the trip as a Christmas present and was really excited and happy that she's gonna go there, but today she told me she's like Meh, not really that excited for it.

Before I had to leave I asked what fullfills her or her days and she said nothing and I asked how long has she been feeling like this and she said since around/after Christmas and that it should be over in like 2 months. I asked how was she so sure and she said it has happened in the past always like that.

While we were sitting down she also said she feels as if there are two parts in her, like two minds (not exactly) and that one part doesn't care about the other one and doesn't care about the things she does. And she went on about this for a while and then said that these two parts together don't mean anything. I told her that I don't really have two parts where one would feel careless about stuff I do and that I feel united and I recognize my actions completely with different feelings but in my one mind. She then told me But I am normal, everyone is like this, or not? And at that point I got a feeling like shit, I might be crazy..

Anyways to end it off when I got to know her after a few months we slept at my friends house together in one room (just the two of us). Before going to sleep she took some drugs(something like diazepam IIRC) and when we went to sleep I fell asleep but then she touched and I couldn't sleep and after a while she just sat up from the bed and started looking around the room. And I was like hey what's up, what is there? And she didn't respond, so I touched her on her arm and asked okay? And she just started shouting that he's in the room and that she wants him to go away and that she's scared, so I just held her and turned on the lights.. it went on for a while and she was really scared and after she seemed conscious she told me to turn off the lights but she still looked around the room as if there was someone with us. I was staring at her from 10 cm in her face and her eyes just went across the room, stopped a little bit away from me and just stared, like I even weren't there. Then we spoke about it and she told this happens to her every night but she can't talk about it too much, but just told me she is scared before sleeping and that he's there always. It's like the thing would hurt her and make her hurt herself if she told me more. That's all I know.

The medication (diazepam, I remember lexaurin as well) wasn't prescribed for her, but her mother works in a hospital and got it for her from her friend for her anxiety. (She gets anxious, or mainly used to get a lot)


Can anyone here tell me what can I do for her?

a bit of background: 
i am getting worried about my friend and housemate. he came to Australia from Turkey about 5 years ago and we've known each other most of that time. he doesn't have any family here, and I am his closest friend in the country. he's in his early 30s.

he has always had some ""new age"" spiritual beliefs - he has used LSD quite often for at least 10 years and smokes marijuana daily. a few months ago he went to India and Nepal and went to a lot of ""psychedelic parties"" there, he came back talking about other dimensions and mind-reading and so on. this is not too unusual for him, as he's had unusual spiritual beliefs ever since I've known him.

lately: 
over the last few weeks, I've noticed his mental state declining. he has not returned to his job for at least a month, he sits at home all day smoking marijuana and reading about conspiracy theories on the internet. he's becoming more and more into these theories, and less attached to reality. about 2 weeks ago he came into my room crying because he was experiencing paranoia and thought that people were trying to hurt him/read his mind. he told me that ""they"" were controlling the world, and that the apocalypse would come that night. I took him to the hospital when he became more agitated, but they couldn't keep him there against his will as he wasn't threatening violence or self-harm.

over the last couple of weeks he's become obsessed with biblical and conspiracy theories. he tells me he is the ""sun god"" and he has been sent to gather his tribe before the apocalypse. a lot of talk about Mayans, aliens, Noah's ark, pyramids and unseen dimensions. he gets very upset when I tell him I won't leave the city to prepare for the apocalypse, and seems genuinely worried for my well-being.

He sees a psychologist occasionally for stress, but as far as I know he has not been diagnosed with any kind of disorder or prescribed any medication. I suspect he is not sharing his beliefs with his therapist.
I don't think he in planning on hurting himself or anyone else, but I am very worried for his mental state as he becomes more and more delusional. I have chat-logs with him demonstrating some of his condition. Any advice would be much appreciated.

Diagnosing yourself can be dangerous. With the internet being as popular as it is, more and more mental illnesses seem to be arising.  It is good for us to discuss symptoms, but it we have to remember that telling someone they ""sound"" like they have schizophrenia can be harmful to them. Only a doctor can diagnose this. 

I originally signed up to this topic to discuss how to deal with a diagnosis that was given to me after a long, drawn out process involving doctors, hospitilizations, and medical testing.  Ways to cope with every day life and our symptoms and medication discussion. 


I've noticed a moderator has posted a topic similar to this, as well, and I think that we, as a community, should gather together and make sure to push those wondering about their symptoms to speaking with a doctor before diagnosing themselves right up.  The FAQ needs to be updated, as well, and maybe we could add a few other links to NAMI and other various outlets (I am on my phone, currently, so if anyone has any good links, please share!) so that those looking for answers about their current state have a more professional answer. 

So, in closing, I ask that all of you, before you go on to say someone ""sounds"" like they may have schizophrenia, tell them, instead, that only a doctor can give them the help that they need. This includes minors who say that they do not want to tell their parents. I hate to sound harsh, but this is something that really needs to be taken more seriously.

In high school I was a cheerleader... you know, friendly, social, happy. Went off to my dream college to study aerospace engineering, my truest passion (satellites!). I was always very motivated. 

It just feels like my whole personality was turned upside down in the course of a month. I started to hear voices. At first not much noticeable, but it got worse and worse. My grades declined, my hygiene went down, every relationship I have was strained. I could not function.

After about a month I attempted suicide - partially due to hallucinations. I had no idea I was sick. The first few months of treatment are a huge blur in my mind, but I was in inpatient for over 2 months. The diagnosis was like a slap in the face. Schizophrenia? Let me be honest here. I was so ignorant on this disease. When I thought of it, I thought of people in strait jackets and shit. (I know, I'm sorry, I am no longer that ignorant obviously...) but at the time it was horrifying to me because I didn't understand it. 

I understand it now and after months of treatment and medicine changes I am able to live a normal life. My SO is my caretaker and I have my bad days. I dropped out of college for the semester I had the break, but I'm going back to it. At a different university. My SO got into grad school and I decided to transfer to where he was. We now have our own home together with our little puppy and things are good. But they are different.

Either way, I think me looking sad has more to do with my medication change from Clozapine at night to in the morning. So I'm more sedated at work than I've been previously.

It'd be nice to talk. I haven't seen my therapist in over a month now.. I haven't been talking to anyone about my symptoms or ""delusions"" and I'm falling down the rabbit hole.

Maybe because I've got a smaller chance of hearing the usual ""you should go see a doctor"" and maybe have someone react with experince in the field.

Around my 16ish I started changing. I guess it all started with a very vivid imagination as a kid (""there are aliens and they want to take me and watch me sleep""), no friends whatsoever and not much trust in other human beings. I think it started with me being confused and feeling like something's missing. That feeling never went away.

Fast forward to now. I'm linked to other versions of me in different worlds. We're being hunted by bleak creatures, for sport. The first one of us to go down lived in a beautiful swamp. We all experienced the death of our part. This ""us"" got bitten in half by something gigantic with sharp teeth. And a very bleak appearance. It was traumatizing to experience someone's dead who's closer than a brother. A part of me died and hasn't returned. 

I'm not entirely real and I doubt anyone is. Most of the people around me are programmed, they go back into non-existence when I lose contact with them. I feel trapped.

I hear scratching at the door, sniffing in my ear. I hear footsteps. I'm terrified of them. When I hear something at the door, I don't have the guts to throw open the door and confront the source. In theory, it's in my head and there's no source. I don't want to find out. I'll wait until the sounds are gone.

I'm plugged into my mp3 player when I'm alone. When I go to sleep, it's playing. When I wake up, it's playing. I can't hear anything else.

There's something inside of my head that's sometimes helping me, sometimes breaking me down like I'm firewood and it's the fire. I know things before possible being able to know them. It saved my life a few times. And it laughs at me when I fail. It speaks to me. Not with words. We don't think in words. We think in images, sounds, smells, memories, dreams... 
It told me to stick a screwdriver inside of my head and how delightful it would feel. I really wanted to stick the screwdriver inside of my brain. It seemed like better than chocolate. I didn't because of logic. But what will stop me when I am totally convinced I am not real? you can't kill something that's not real.

Maybe then I will wake up for real, step up from a bed and be applauded by some sort of watchers, because I passed a test or something. That's what the thing inside of my head made me see/feel/experience?

I know what's real and what's not. To some  extent. I live by logic. I'm going to a psychologist, sort of. They're requesting my data at the hospital and previous psychologists to see what conclusion-thingie_for_data the need to give me. Because I am totally sane and came to them for candy they call meds, I guess. I've got no trust in them. But hey, if I'm declared unfit for society, I an atleast get some sort of fund.

Oh, by the way, does it count when you don't really care about humans as individuals and got grand ideas how to save the human race which are being put down by other humans I speak to? I believe we're doomed to die and turn to a horrible society steered by money and no one wants to do something about it because everyone only thinks about themselves? It makes me really pissed about it, because we will be nothing 100 years from now. No one will remember us. So why not kill ourselves / make rules for procreation in order to thin out the human population so we can survive as a species? We're not real in the end, as far as we're real now.

I want to start out this post saying that I have only been diagnosed with anxiety and depression (though right now I'm not really depressed, but I have had fatigue and motivation issues for a few weeks). I am not any medications daily to treat my depression or my anxiety. I'm on trazodone to sleep, Atarax/Vistaril (replaced my xanax I'd been on for years, but I hate it because it gives me vivid nightmares and makes me paranoid so I only take it when absolutely necessary which has been once in the past two months.) I take sumatriptan when needed for my migraines and I'm also on butturbur to help curb my migraines as well. I googled my hallucination symptoms and it's directed me to this board as well as a few other communities for schizophrenia. Anyways, starting a few weeks ago I noticed I was hallucinating somewhat regularly. The first time I noticed it was when I was driving home from doing laundry at my parents house. I saw a small white dog run across the street onto a residential street. I immediately pulled over to look for the dog with my brights on, I was terrified it would get hit since it was dark. I couldn't find it so I shrugged and pulled back onto the main street to go home. I saw the dog run across the street the next three times at each residential street. It was almost like it was the same 'animation' as I saw it the first time. I realized it was probably never there in the first place.      

Two weeks ago on my day off I was also hallucinating pretty much all day. I was seeing little black bugs crawling all over me and my bed and the walls. I'd immediately brush them off or go to move or smack them and they'd disappear.     

Today I've got like snow in my vision, the kind of static you would get if you turned an old TV to an unused station and you'd get that static snow on the TV. I also feel incredibly anxious for no reason and paranoid. I have to drive across town again today to do laundry and meet up with my family for dinner and I just have this dread in the pit of my stomach. I'm afraid if I go out I'm going to get in a car wreck.        

Other symptoms: general tiredness, not really wanting to do anything, noises and sound seems to be amplified (I got a cheese stick and they're all stuck together in perforated plastic and when I ripped it free from the others it made a loud noise that made me jump.) 

So I have no idea if this is a fleeting thing or if I should call my doctor. I'm actually almost afraid to call my doctor because I don't want her to laugh at me, for lack of a better term. I don't have a psychiatrist or a therapist or anything because I can't afford it. ",['attr'],0,neu_vader

It was silly, but we loved it and I miss my brother very much. The man I see now looks like him, but Ive almost accepted he is gone, and there is a shell pretending to be him.

Until he was diagnosed at 0, he was a really good guy. You know the type that would give the shirt off his back and actually he was a bit of a pushover, but a good guy nonetheless. But then he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and the medication he was on was good for about 5 years, but then it stopped working. Everything has been bad since then.

He has been in and out of jail since then. Last time he went because he wanted to see what the inside of our other brother looked like, so he tried chasing him with a knife. Luckily for them both a cop was driving by and took him to jail. He is just getting worse and he lives with our mom. She confided in me recently she sleeps with her bedroom door locked because she is scared of him. She will be 60 next year. I want him gone, but she refuses to listen to anyone and Im scared of what he will do next.

Due to the personal nature of the content, he wouldn't let me, or anyone read it until it was published on Kindle.

I am not looking for a diagnosis (not on here lol) and do not believe i have schizophrenia. I am posting here because i can relate to what many of you struggle with. That being said, here is my history:

As  a child, i was always in my own world. Memories of my childhood is very spotty and distant. I can recall being very imaginative and creative and spacing out until things looked different. I had very extreme emotions (unecessary outbursts of anger mostly) and struggled with depression. 

Jump to middle school and high school:
I began withdrawing socially. Being around people would make me very uncomfortable and i would always feel detached and paranoid (it was hell whenever people laughed.) I slept in class and my grades never came back up throughout the rest of high school. I began using marijuana at 15(it has induced ""episodes"" only twice and i never used regularly until after high school.). Now it helps me to be comfortable in my mind (i do not recommend it as medication esp. if you are psychotic!!!) 

At 17, i became depressed and believed i was the laughingstock of the entire world. I started drinking after getting sent to continuation and that made my mental state spiral into a place i can't remember very much. 

This is when things got bad. I began having these nights where i would stay up all night imagining stories in my head. I will not get into detail lol. Everything kept spiraling until one point when i didn't want to live anymore. After my second suicide attempt, i was finally hospitalized.

In the ER, i don't remember much other than rambling. My dad said he couldn't understand me (this was never brought up to any doctors because my parents weren't aware what this was) and that i would talk in circles. After getting put into the mental hospital, they put me on respiridol and celexa (anti-depressant). The respirdol turned me into a zombie that would echo the end of my sentences. The other one sort of blunted the emotion i was feeling (i stopped them after six months and felt free again)

Having a job has been hard. At mcdonalds (19 years old) i thought everyone was against me because of my skin color and heard everyone talking about me. It wasn't until i looked back that it may have possibly been in my head.

I remember being diagnosed with ""major depressive disorder"". Sorry if there isn't enough info it's very hard to remember. Let's jump forward to right now.

Now i am 22. I am a musician who plays blues guitar. Now, depression was definitely what i went through before but now it's different. I will make it clear that i have used psychedelic drugs (had a bad experience on mushrooms with delusions and auditory hallucinations that i'm sure was full-blown psychosis but it didn't last more than a few days so it's safe to say it was drug-induced). I am not worried about that because it has been a long time since then.

Having those experiences actually helped me become aware. What worries me now is that i have weird, inappropriate moods that switch on a dime like when i was a boy. I feel that people use code to talk shit about me and that even my best friends are talking shit about me. I feel that everyone is racist (which isn't far from the truth). I also have minor auditory disturbances (hearing crowds of whispers/jungle noises and hearing words where actual noises are like air conditioning and cars passing by) but honestly i think those are pretty cool. Some visual disturbances as well like if i stare everything changes (gets blurry/warps) and that has happened way before using any psychedelics. I am worried because i haven't been this way for a long time and it can't be from drugs because it has been a very long time since i have used

My therapist suggested schizoaffective and she hasn't been responding to me about my concerns lately. What's your opinion? Please do not play psychiatrist and try to diagnose. I just want to know if anyone can relate to this. I am only aware of these things when looking back, not as they happen. Marijuana doesn't seem to make things worse unless i am already aggravated. Sorry about the long post just want someone to relate no diagnosis and i am not looking to self-diagnose. Self-diangosers make me want to punch them in the face. Sorry again for the long post. Tis is only a glimpse of it if you have questions feel free to ask i will clarify to the best of my ability. And if you mention drugs please feel free to fuck off because i was this way before knowing anything about getting high. And sometimes it isn't until i smoke that i see things clearly but i am different than everyone else. I probably didn't paint a good picture so please let me know if you meed clarification.

This is my first post.
From those who have this - What could f your parents said to you that might have made sense to get some help?

Amyone else been through Probate to force this issue of help?

Does the disease progress.  My concern is he was 'pink' slipped they told us that he was a harm to him self, or otheres.  I see no reason why this would have changed.  He has not been physical but that is my current thought.  - I hat to say it but I put a knife under my pillow last night.  I truly do not know what to do.

I've had two what I would call manic psychotic episodes. The first, was around the time of a messy break up with my first partner. I believed she'd cheated on me and, eventually, that she'd become some sort of crack whore. I manipulated this in my mind to be of benefit to me. Essentially I felt cuckolded, embarrassed and that my social standing was gravely damaged.

After hospitalisation and medication, I got depressed and went back to drug use pretty quickly. I developed delusions of reference over this time also.

These delusions of reference, largely related to my sexuality, which was very confused for a time.

My second psychosis was mostly fuelled by stimulants. It involved a lot of end of the world themes, along with delusions of grandeur. I was hyper-sexual over this period of time. And hurt a lot of peoples feelings through indiscretion.

What can I understand about myself from those experiences...

I am a narcissist at heart. Not that uncommon among my friends. The loss of my ex was destructive to narcissistic supply which collapsed what I considered to be mine. In this tiny space I had left, things twisted and as a reaction to the pressure I had to elate myself in an attempt to compensate.

My delusions of reference? Again quite narcissistic, self centred view of the world.

My second psychosis? Yet again an evolution of narcissism to a point of believing literally I was the centre of the universe.

And with that, I feel quite detached from reality a lot of the time. I've done things I regret, but at the time didn't have the capacity to comprehend the consequences. I was some what an automaton, driven by base instinctions of preservation and operating using a distorted view of social ideals (that from subsisting in a stoner/drug culture where people did very little except think highly of themselves)",['conj'],0,neu_vader

I stopped using hard drugs in January, but still smoke marijuana. In January I was using the fake weed substitute Diablo very heavily and I had intense periods of derealization, hallucinations, fear, thinking I was somewhere else, and thinking I had gone insane and my family was trying to snap me out if a trance that was my life. I went to a mental hospital, got off drugs and things seemed to calm down, but I couldn't shake the feeling of unreality. I mostly got better but used dextromethorphan and weed one night and started thinking I was in the hospital repeating and overdose, I could hear the EKG and felt the shock paddles.
 I have also developed a very strange headache that has not gone away in over 3 weeks.  It feels like pressure in my head behind my face, it also seems to be felt in my hand at times, causing it to tingle and make it feel like there is blood or liquid on my hands. I take 25mg of seroquel in the morning and 225mg of seroquel at night as well as some other unrelated meds.
 Recently it seems like the fear and paranoia has come back and I find myself getting more and more worried about it again. It also seems like I am hearing strange sounds either way off in the distance or unintelligible so I can't make out what it is. It doesn't seem real, like I remember hearing it but I don't remember what the sound was.

I've been through my hero-complex, my victim complex, and now I'm finally able to see myself for just how bad I'm getting. Everything I put in this post is half to get it out of my book and half to give you any information I can to help me out.

I guess I should start with a backstory before I get to anything else.

So it all started back in July 2008. I was 17 and a junior in high school. I was a pretty popular guy. You could call me a class clown, because I didn't take anything too seriously and I was pretty much friends with everyone. I was raised to be a good dude. Then, on July 1st, 2008 my best friend committed suicide. His mom had died of cancer several years before, his dad was a deadbeat, and his older brother who took care of him was really abusive. My mom died in 2005 and we were both into music so we clicked really quick and we were pretty much inseparable from the moment we met on. I was really close to the dude, and it just hit me with a massive pile of guilt about how I didn't see it and I wasn't there and a whole slew of other terrible things. Which brought on the repressed depression from my mom's death on august 15th, 2005. It didn't help that school officials came after me to get all of his friends and notify them of what happened. 

I had a girlfriend at the time and it was really just a relationship of physical attraction, so I came to her for some kind of support and she just tried to do what horny teenage girls with no life skills tried to do, and so we had this teary argument and broke up.

So I'm sitting on top of a pile of guilt and depression and I just broke up with a really sweet girl and my junior summer was going really, really badly. 

I don't have much in the way of family, which I'll address later on, but for about a month I was pretty much alone, and extremely depressed and mad at myself for the shit I let happen to people that mattered.

Not in your slick black hair, emo-band-shirt cry to a diary type depressed, but as a young man reflecting on serious preventable mistakes type depressed. 

Then starting on August 17th, 2008 lasting until August 21st, 2008 I had the most awkward thing happen to me. It started out as a sort of all-female choir group that would at random times during the day very quietly sing to no apparent rhythm for between 20 minutes to several hours.

On August 19th, 2008, I had an agonizing migraine. I mean crippling to the point where I could not stand, the slightest amount of light made me want to vomit and I was physically incapable of any kind effort to do anything. This migraine started at approximately 6:00 PM and lasted until I fell asleep at some time after 10:00. 

After I had this migraine, as well as the strange noise issue, I started a journal because I was legitimately worried I was either going to die, or my mental health would be dramatically impacted.

During the month of august, and I didn't write this down in the journal, I began talking with the girl I'd begin dating, starting December 2, 2008.

September 2008 saw no real painful symptoms, but I did start having incredibly vivid dreams, some of them were pleasant, and some of them were grotesquely violent.

I've written down a few that I felt were profound or deserved note.

Dream 1: I'm an older man in what felt like a warehouse for making leather supplies for either Nazi Germany, or for a resistance during Nazi era France. There's a commotion and my coworkers and I flee to hide, but I don't make it out, I hide beneath a table as several men search for my coworkers and I. 

During the part of the dream I felt the most overwhelming sense of abhorrent horror I woke up physically crying. The dream ended as they dragged me out and shot me with a pistol of an unknown calibre through the neck. I physically felt penetration and awoke moments later in sweat and cried when I realized it was a dream. I am a man and rarely ever cry, especially over dreams.

Dream 2: I am myself with my brother and tens of other people that I do not know. We are all standing at night, starless sky, in a massive field of green grass, on a small decline. At first I scan the area and see some type of encampment, I am drawn to it. My brother is scared but I reassure him that we are doing the right thing. We arrive, I don't remember witnessing our actual travel to the area. It appears to be a government complex. They line up civilians and have us perform strange tasks, like putting our hands in a bucket of water with a low electrical current, or standing on a launch pad that sends us up 15-20 feet in the air. I remember the slight pain of the electrical current, but absolutely no pain from the launch pad. I actually remember excitement as I lifted into the air.

After completing the tasks they assigned me, I remember looking for my brother, who was nowhere to be found. Then I was looking at an incredibly fast aircraft dock in a larger blimp like aircraft in the sky, both of which had a green coloring, as I watched these aircraft I felt this feeling of complete and utter serenity. It was the most at peace I have ever felt and sometimes when I'm incredibly deep in a terrifying episode I will recall the dream and be far more at peace.

Dream 3: I'm myself, though a young child, early elementary school years. There's a man down the staircase in my old elementary school building and he is in some unknown way bad. He appears as what I could best describe as a diluted Beetlejuice from the Keaton movie. Similar clothes, but a much old face and body type. I am the only one able to stand up to him, and I have some secret device in my pocket that will allow me to thwart him. I am unusually brave as I stare down the man, and he attempts to strike me up with a deal. I do not know what the deal was, nor if he holds true. I woke up feeling confident but had this terrible fear of the dark for the remainder of that night. I turned on all the lights in the house but couldn't shake the odd fear.

There's a total of 6 dreams that I wrote down, but those three seem to high-light the themes present in all dreams.

October 2008 saw the return of the choir and a difficulty focusing on things. 

November 2008 saw a similar pattern.

My current girlfriend, (And likely lifemate) began dating December 2, 2008. I did not tell her of any of the mental symptoms at this point. I figured they were just byproducts of depression. The month felt far more stressful than usual.

January 2009 was an awful month. I began hearing muffled voices constantly, but they seemed to come from within I'd say 5 feet of myself, leading to sleepless nights and extreme paranoia. I told my dad about the voices and he told me that he was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 26, but that my mom had been diagnosed as Bipolar when she was 17. 

It turns out my mother started drinking at 17 due to bad home life and her bipolar disorder. She died on August 15th, at 8:37 PM due to a heart condition associated with alcoholism.

Genuinely terrified of the future and really bummed out, I carried on.

The Rest of 2009 has a lot of footnotes but to save time I will condense it as best as possible.
Actually, I think I'm writing to descriptive now to be productive. I'm going to condense the next few years up to 2013 as best as I can.

- Girlfriend and I hit off swimmingly, but a new issue developed in early March; crowds became a huge problem. When I was in a crowd of people, the voices would get louder and faces would become malformed and terrifying. I dropped out of high school my senior year. It seriously made me sad.

- Early June I began seeing people in the dark, for about a split second or two. They didn't move or speak at all, they were occasionally in peripheral vision, and when I'd glance at them they'd disappear, or I'd look right at them but they'd distort out of my view.

- Late November I tell my girlfriend about schizophrenia, she tells me we'll work through it. I considered breaking up with her out of self pity. Decided against it.

2010 saw crowds become terrifying. I starting thinking that I could read minds when I was in a crowd, and that everyone in a crowd wanted to, in some way or another, read my mind. I also became convinced that my vivid dreams were actually visions of actual ghosts.

In late 2010 I began seeing people and things for extended periods of time. Occasionally they'll move to face me. Usually just average people, but I have seen, in the dark some kind of scaly thing with strange eyes. Regular talks with my Girlfriend's superstitious mom leads me to believe I can see the dead and demons. 

In early 2011 I develop a hallucination named Josef Skeller, who goes by Mr. Skeller. Going along with the early mentioned belief, I begin doing weird things at the advice of Mr. Skeller. Girlfriend is kind of convinced by coincidences and her mom that I can talk to the dead.

You can probably see the downhill pattern forming by now. 

By the end of 2011, I begin seeing horribly deformed / mutilated hallucinations, start hearing voices in full effect, and begin having night terror that leave me paralyzed upon waking up for several minutes. Pleasant dreams become less and less prevalent. Talk to dad about beliefs, he tells me I can't speak to the dead and that I need to man up and remind myself that I have a disease any time I feel a god complex.

I tried to argue but he brought up a really valid argument ""Go talk to your mom if you don't like what I'm saying.""

I was butthurt but he was completely right.

By 2012, I'm trying desperately to overcome night terrors, can usually talk myself out of a stupor. Sat down my girlfriend and told her that when I'm going off the deep end she needs to completely control the situation or it'll get worse, et cetera. She does a pretty good job being the boss when I go crazy. 

2012 is a good year to highlight because I feel like I made a LOT of progress. I stopped listening to my Skeller hallucination, which was a lot harder than it sounds and I've been able to be in a group of friends if I'm fairly intoxicated, which, while not the best thing ever, is a huge step up from not being able to walk down the street without being scared for my life.
I also stopped believe I could talk to the dead / fight demons / read minds. Although I do get these episodes where it gets awful for everyone involved. 

By the end of 2012, I was on a high note.

But then 2013 kicks in and I start working at a new place and I just get overwhelmingly afraid that my coworkers, who I get along great with, are trying to get me fired, or get with my girlfriend or whatever.
And on a lower note than that, I'm starting to realize that my girlfriend is losing patience with me.

I've also started having episodes where I feel like I'm not a part of my life, I'm just casually looking in through the eyes of me. Like someone else has the reins and I'm just along for the ride. 

And I'm slowly losing patience too. I'm starting to see people as pure annoying. A lady took too long to checkout? I hope she dies.
Toddler is asking too many questions? I hope he grows up alone.

Those kinds of thoughts, and I fully mean them, in my head. I have to catch myself and really go ""Hey man, what are you becoming?!""

I'm still writing my journal, and I think maybe I need to keep writing it for good, if only to reflect on my more crazy moments.
Some of my friends said that people would be really interested reading it, even if it's a LOT of gibberish.
I guess now would be a good time to start asking questions.

1.) Has anyone dealt with these episodes where you're in second person? Where it feels like someone else is controlling you? How do you get your life back?

2.) How on earth do can I stop the anathema of groups? Just the thought of something I used to love now makes my stomach drop and it's starting to affect my social life. None of my friends outside of a handful of very close people know that I have some type of mental illness, and I don't want to drive them away.  Is there any way to just suck it up and deal with large groups? I miss society..

3.) Is there anything I can do to stop the faces in the darkness? Closing my eyes sometimes works, but sometimes I'll open them and have a torn-up mutilated face you know, 2 inches from mine. Doesn't really help the sleep schedule.

4.) Is there anything I can do to reduce the severity of night terrors? I wake up feeling sore from them nowadays and I just want a good night sleep.

5.) Am I the only person to have an imaginary friend like Skeller? That's the aspect that confuses me the most as most people don't suffer that type of hallucination. He's recurring and consistent, and has a made up story out of my imagination. Insistent, and has a snide personality unlike my own.

6.) Does it get worse? I'm 22, and I've been dealing with a gradually worse and worse affliction since I was 17 years old. My biggest fear right now, besides the crazy fears, is that it's going to continue to get worse until I just completely lose the guy I was at one point. That'd be the worst thing that could happen.

She didn't show any signs of it beforehand, it was like it was activated when she finished high school. But basically in these panic attacks she believes that people are out to get her, shooting her with beams in her heart, trying to rape her etc. Sometimes she would have these freak outs everyday and they can last a really long time.

I can't say my parents haven't done anything, they have tried many pills to stop the attacks but the current pills pretty much make her ""empty,"" more specifically, you could say they only mute her without actually doing anything to ""help"" or ""fix"" her. She may live with this for the rest of her life but as a family we don't know what to do about it. She's 26 still living at home, basically after high school just stayed and progressively became more insane.

TL;DR: sister has schizo for as long as I can remember, family can't take it anymore but won't do anything about it. If anyone has experienced therapy, hospitilization, medications, that have helped you please give me advice because I hate visiting home now and as cold as it may seem it feels as though she died when she started having episodes because as a person she is broken. 

On another note, I have an undiagnosed brother who hasn't spoken for about the same time as my sister lost it. Before he stopped functioning, he became obsessed with aliens and alternative healing (magnets, amulets, etc.) which seemed fine but one day he wouldn't stop laughing and that progressed to not talking and then living at home leeching off my parents at 25.

My parents don't know what to do, I don't know what to. I know this may not be the absolute best place to post this but idk. Lastly, I'm truly sorry if I offended anyone with how I view my siblings but when you live with people in such a condition for so long, it just feels like they die as people and become a huge burden and a problem. When I was young experiencing all of this for the first time, I just grew an absolute hatred of her because of the attacks, the screaming especially. I just wanted a normal family and life but I don't know what to do, my other sister is ""normal"" in the same sense I am but she moved away and stays away because of these problems, though she is 28 so It's normal and my other two siblings should have graduated college already and living on their own. I wrote all of this as she was screaming to my mom about all of it so yeah. It's so difficult for me to talk about this I'm not even going to reread this.

He claims he is sure he doesn't have it, but he hasn't been tested, his dad has severe schizophrenia to where he has to be in a mental institution and his grandmother on his dads side also had it. At first we all thought he was a little cooky but hes very nice and we all enjoy being around him so hes become one of the main people in our friend group. Recently, however things have been happening that are worrisome to me and the rest of my friends. 



My friends and I have known each other for years, and because of that we have some shared stories. Recently whenever we bring them up or just have a one on one conversation about something that happened to just two of us or a few of us but not this other friend he gets very emotional, sometimes to tears and will make up a story about something that happened between him and his other long lost friend who's name he doesn't remember. Its a new friend each time. We can be joking around and he will make a joke along with us, if it doesn't get the reaction he expects he will start clinching his jaw and mouthing things like ""no, no, stupid"" while shaking his head. This has never really bothered us because we know hes a little different and everything but we still all like him. However, in the past week some really out of the ordinary things have happened. 


We went out to eat at a Chinese takeout place after we got some ice cream. Everyone was eating their food except him, no one really noticed and I was talking to my friend next to me about something that had happened earlier that day. My friend noticed he hadn't eaten anything so he says ""Hey ____ are you not hungry or anything? You haven't even opened your food."" Just a genuine and honest question, but he turns to my friend with his head down at the table and gritting his teeth, clearly angry says ""Do you think I'm fucking oblivious? I'm not an idiot."" Everyone at the table looked over to see what was wrong because that was nothing to be mad about. In an instant he completely changes his demeanor, puts on a smile and says ""oh I'm just not hungry!"" We get back to our place and he came over for a few hours to hang out. We asked what had happened since we were in the privacy of our own home, he said ""I'm done lying to you guys."" We've never thought he was lying to us or doing wrong by us except for his stories. Before we had gone to get ice cream I had been reading the picture of Manny Pacquiao with the quotes about how he submitted to all of Mayweathers demands for the boxing match and his friend asked him why, Manny replies ""That's what we do in our country, give them everything they want before an execution."" He said we we asked to go get ice cream shortly after he was scared the whole time thinking that we were taking him somewhere to beat him up or kill him because I had told everyone about the picture. We've known him for almost 6 months now so he has no reason to think that. But things are getting progressively weirder, he will leave our apartment and stand just around the corner trying to listen to us then speed off when he hears the door open, or wait below my friends open window to see what he can hear. I'm just really hoping for some advice in how to deal with this, we all like him but we are genuinely scared for what he might do because he thinks we are going to kill him or something. 


Sorry for the novel but there's been a lot going on. TL;DR, possibly schizophrenic friend thinks we are going to hurt him and is acting in ways that scare us because of it. Thanks in advance for any replies

EDIT: The reason his dad is so bad is because he never got any help or medication, we are just afraid that something is boiling inside of him that he cant help but will get worse if he doesn't get any professional help. We are afraid to bring it up out of fear of making him mad again because hes pretty unpredictable when he gets angry. The last story he told us about his dad was how he had an episode when he was drunk and started shooting his gun in the house while his step-mom hid in the bathroom, we know his dad hasn't remarried and he said this happened just a few weeks ago, well after his mom and dad divorced many years ago.

**Act One: The Beginning**

Around the middle of 2012 I started getting rather depressed, my whole life was building up around me and I felt myself falling down into a black pit. My then-partner noticed this and convinced me to see my GP, which I did and she referred me to my local CMHT (Community Mental Health Team). I visited the CMHT roughly every two weeks and saw a very nice nurse and doctor there who always seemed to care and broke things down for me. After about 2 months of this, they told me they suspected Bi Polar disorder and started me on Lamotragine, gradually bringing up the dose which did seem to have a small effect. Eventually I started to feel myself again, was able to catch up with work and get on with life.



**Act Two: The Monster Returns (with new teeth)**

Fast forward to the start of 2013, I was starting to feel my energy levels drop, outlook on life dip and my general ""me-ness"" dissipate. Although this time didn't feel as bad as the last, there was one particular symptom which made it 10x worse, I had voices in my head and was even beginning to see things/animals/people that weren't there. It's as if the border between what was real and what was imagination had disappeared. I was literally terrified. I phoned my doctor and went to the appointment he subsequently set up. I discussed what was happening around me and how it was affecting me. While I was incredibly scared, I had still clung on to my ability to reason (i.e. if the people I'm with don't react to a fox on the table opposite, it probably wasn't there). In that, my doctor wasn't terribly worried about it, and sent me away and to told to call back if things got worse. This continued on into the start of February.

January wasn't all bad however, me and my then-partner had just moved into a new flat in Brighton, East Sussex (from West Sussex).



**Act Three: Goodbye Reason, Hello Hospital**

It would have been around the start of February in which I started to feel myself losing my ability to simply ""reason"" away everything around me. Around the same people around me started commenting on withdrawn I seemed and my then-partner was getting worried as I had stopped working, looking after myself or even leaving the bed, as well as some of the things I was saying and how I was reacting around the flat. While my partner was out, something must have snapped: All logic and reason had gone, my mine had consumed itself. I'm still not sure exactly what happened, however the gist is that daemonic shadows had appeared around the flat and were terrorising me, to the point where I tried to take my own life with 32 paracetamol tablets thinking it would be quick. My partner came home, found me in a mess and upon discovery of what I had done, phoned an ambulance. I was treated in a general hospital for the overdose and placed under a section and taken to the mental hospital up the road. 

While in the hospital ""me"" essentially came back to reason what I was seeing, after a few days stay. I was started on Quetiapine (anti-psychotic) and they also continued my Lamotragine. The doctors in the hospital threw practically everything in the ICD at me: Bi Polar Disorder, Schizophrenia, Borderline Personality Disorder and many more. After 2 weeks in hospital, one under section, one in-formally, I was released home.

Now the psychosis is constant, all the time, everyday. However my ability to reason is transient, and becoming harder and harder to do.



**Act Four: East Sussex**

After being messed about on dates, my hospital followup appointment was exactly a week after release and I attended, the nurse there suggested it be first-episode psychosis and they are reluctant to put a label on anything or begin any proper treatment. They referred me to the Early Intervention Service the following week. Again I went, and I was in for a shock. Not only was I completely condescended too, they failed to get even the basic facts of my medical history right. I explained everything that had happened and was happening, and it was completely trivialised. Eventually they just said I was stressed and my case was going to be closed. They halted all treatment, medications, contacts. Everything.



**Act Five: The Present**

So here I am now, every day going by where I feel a little bit more of myself disappear. Sitting in a flat where every electronic device is covered in tin-foil to prevent government monitoring (I remember doing it, I remember why, if I remove it I will just re-do it later, but it just wasn't me).

I feel I have nowhere to turn, I was recommended to the charity MIND who while shocked at my treatment, only recommended putting in a formal complaint. I don't want to complain, I just want to protect myself while I still have the ability too, and I don't know how much longer that will be for.



Sorry I don't really know what I intend to do by writing this post, I'm hoping this excellent community might have some suggested or just want to know that I'm not the only one rejected help.

Though, I am puzzled because there's Ellen Sacks among other high-profile personalities who appear to be well-functioning without any cognitive impediments. But the major kicker for me was the 'thought disorder' that raised alarm and concern.

Though, I've done some more research and I stumbled upon 'secondary schizophrenia' which seems more plausible, for that schizophrenia-like manifestation of symptoms can stem beyond just biological underpinnings; but with medication or illicit substance use, and which more likely for me is environmental stress. With that said, it is not a ""certified"" classification, so it is a work-in-progress just like how there's officially PTSD but C-PTSD acknowledged in the trauma field but not so much accepted in the DSM-5 right now.

I have only a very brief stint with anti-psychotics due to adverse side-effects and I'm not taking any right now; however, with better perspective refraining from shoving psychopharm down my throat (perhaps because the psychosis focus of the program is biased for me being an actual hallucinating schizophrenic), and with more psychodynamically-informed discussions, we have both seen and acknowledged the benefits of lessening symptoms and clarity. On the Personality Assessment Interview (PAI) test I scored high on the 'schizoid' spectrum and compared to the normative, the psychometric psychologist recognized that I was eerily close to a tipping-point psychotic break, to conclude my voluntary in-patient hospitalization admission by discharging me with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

What was the real kicker was that my outpatient clinicians weren't fostering therapeutic alliance enough, that I felt the structured interviews, group-setting, and positing psychiatric intervention induced my stress and in turn furthered my psychosis, which then contributed to a self-revolving confirmation bias. Luckily Abilify itself, which I got a one-day benefit and is currently on-hold, still works in my case as it aims to regulate neurotransmitter levels beyond just for schizophrenia but for bipolar as well. Nevertheless without continuous medication-taking currently, I am doing significantly a lot better in terms of overall cognitive functioning, coherency and perception-wise speaking.

I may be an anomaly here with 'secondary schizophrenia' or just a psychosis-related disorder. Finally, I'm just wondering if y'alls are familiar with 'secondary schizophrenia' as a working-in-progress nomenclature? I felt that a typical full-blown schizophrenic diagnosis was questionable as I was adamantly cluing in on myself and examining my behavior/tendencies as deterministic correlation. Regardless, I had fun capitalizing on my short-lived fame by telling everyone!1!!11 8)

I have had a good experience there, but I am unable to explain exactly what is happening to me, usually because there is not enough time.It has been hard to clear my thoughts recently, but I will try to be clearer in this post than I was in the others.
 Firstly, a year ago, IPOD and flash drive were stolen, and I think that the same person stole them. I will not reveal his ethnicity, but I have other friends of a similar cultural background. They told me when I described that his behavior was somewhat odd. I did want to accuse him of anything, primarily because my paranoia runs wild, and I unable discern what it is going on. The other day he told me to ask my neighbor if he was talking about me. I was feeling paranoid about them talking about me, and I am sure that they are. This frightened my neighbor and he threatened to shoot me. I would not normally do this, but obviously, I was not feeling well. I think to some extent he took advantage of psychotic episodes I was having. And in retrospect, whenever I spoke to him and had problem, he would give me pop psychological advice, and talk about how great his life was, about “energy waves”,  and how people deserve everything that happens to them. I am having trouble understanding him, and regardless of what others are saying, I do not want to think the worst him. However, his behavior seems mildly narcissistic. 
There is another group of people claiming that they wrote all of college essays. This is not true, and I do not think I need to provide arguments for it, as it ridiculous. However, I did have someone look them over, and they writing style word choices were particular to me. This is also intertwined with the issue of me using “big words”.  I do consider the words I use “big”, it is simply the way that I talk, and perhaps if I were from a different they would not notice. “He is good at using big words”, is backhanded insult. It implies that you do not expect the person speaking to be able to use the language proficiently. This was tied in with accusations of be a thug, eating fired chicken, and being sexual promiscuous. What they are attempting to say exactly? I really do not know, everything they say is contradictory, and whatever nonsense comes to their mind, they feel the need to scream at me
People scream at me about being from Brooklyn, anyone who has heard Brooklynites knows that I do not sound remotely like them, and of course, not everyone in Brooklyn speaks in the stereotypical manner imagined by the rest of the country and also there is nothing wrong with the way they speak. I live in the South, and goodness knows, their colloquialisms take time to get used to as well. You would figure that they would be more understanding in this regard, but people seem to dislike anything that remotely different form their usual experience. The final part of this is I am not from Brooklyn, my 9th grade year I had to go to Public in school in a state I had just moved to. I explained to them were as from, but they thought anywhere within New York State was Brooklyn, and I gave up.
There is also the issue of me not alleged not being able to read. I took my GRE exam, in room with a proctor. I did not take it my hometown, but I took it north of border, because it was fairly close to where I used to live, and I do not feel like people are following me there. I heard someone today say that I did well on the exam because no one saw me. The proctor was staring at me the whole time; I do not understand what they are talking about.  As far I reading is concerned, I read nearly every day. They only time I do read is when I am tired from medication adjustment, or psychotic and scared of something. Also, I think someone may listening to my therapy appointments, because, the only time that I have discussed testing recently is with therapist when I told her about school.
I still think that my computer is being hacked, and I think people are reading my emails. My neighbors are always yelling at me, and I do am not allowed to drive anymore because people scream at while I am driving and I almost got into an accident. I have enough of people talking about me constantly and taking every opportunity to degrade me. They even talked about my Mom implying that she “used me”. That person was not my actual Mom but a person my Dad dated for a month and half. My mom is unaware that I filed the complaints, and she is worried that people would retaliate against me if I did, and they already are.
I do not understand why people are emotionally invested in me not being able to read. I do it all time. They do not see me because I am in the house and do not want them spying me. Even if I read in front them, they would say I was not reading and simply putting on show. I have tried to read in public but cannot concentrated to their constant chatter. When I was on campus, I went to library late at night, or early in the morning, when people are not there. I had to type a paper once when people were there and they thought the computer wrote paper form me. I do not have a typewriter and do not know how I would complete assignment with the computer, the professors do not let you hand write them. They keep talking about Camus and Midnight In Paris, even though Camus is from a different continent. The told me Borges and Leo Strauss were anti-Semitic even though they are both Jewish. I passed my French CLEPP exam and they told me I did not take it because they did not “see me”. I think someone is stalking me , or rather, attempting to stalk,  because whenever I go places, they do think that I am there because someone does not see me. I do not think they understand that most people do not care about I am doing, only young people seem to care, and then only a subsection of them. Someone thought that I was in California, a girl tweeted that I had been arrested for robbery in Texas. I heard another person say that I chocked someone in Virginia; I am miles away from those places. I am at my wits end. I really cannot take any more of them, and they are taking advantage my diagnosis, in order to say whatever they would like about me.

I have started to think that I might not be any of this, instead I'm just a hypochondriac, I can get the results I want from the things I think and feel. 

For example: if I touch something on the ground I think that it's LSD, get afraid and become high, for real, my senses and emotions starts to become different, I become as if I'm in LSD. 

Recently I started to get a pain in my heart/chest and I instantly started to think that I had a heart disease but the doctor says that it's just my mind.

When I watch movies or documentaries about HIV and aids I start to think that I have it and I become ill and feel symptoms like the ones that you suffer from if you have HIV and aids.

Could my diagnosis be all in my head? Is this common? All of this affects my relationship, especially the fact that I'm asexual. Could this be that I just started to think that I'm asexual but in reality I'm just normal? 

Is there treatment and medication for hypochondria? And how could I get this diagnosed? As a kid and teenager I read a lot about schizophrenia and in a way lived the part, I started to change. Is it that simple?

Colors took meaning, numbers, I started noticing conversations around me synching up with my thoughts. I've been smoking weed for years to excite this state and it led me to following coincidences and synchronicities all the way to homelessness.  I went through all the government, alien theories, christ conscousness, you name it.  I always came back down to earth, but rested on the idea that life is a dream and synchronicities and coincidences are guiding me everywhere.  I went so far as to think sounds like sirens, birds chirping, car door slams all meant something.  It all became a confusing mess and luckily I was able to move in with my mother to finally quit smoking weed and the delusions have mostly subsided. 

 I'm still fighting the desire to believe in the synchronicities.  If I move to walk forward just as a car revs it's engine,  it's an indication I am in synch with the dream.  Car alarms and sirens are telling me I'm doing something wrong or need to be alert.  The dream speaks to me through random outside conversations as well. Leading me, teating me. 
furthermore
I've always had a vivid imagination and now it seems it has taken over.  For instance, I was taking a shower at a friends house and looking out the window, I couldn't figure where it was facing, looked like it was pointing at an unknown part of the complex, I immagined it was a portal to another dimension and it's like my brain went haywire.  I was slightly anxious about it until I could step outside the apt and see I was just mistaken, I mean I was sure it was just misperception but it was as if a child in me was convinced a story was real.  I hope this makes sense.  It's like my imagination has run haywire.  

Weed has been my medication to cure my depression for years now I'm constantly depressed and annoyed, extremely anoyed.  
I used to bounce my leg when I sat down and figured I had beaten the habbit but it's back now.  

I also have been experiencing hypnogogic and hypnopompic dreams and occasional audio halucinations.  

Some days I feel practically normal, other days I am paranoid people are looking at me, judging me...  that is why I wonder about schizoaffective, bipolar...  someone even suggested OCD because I have made up so many meanings to random sounds and notice them constantly.  If I was to smoke weed right now I would become lucid and my mind would create the most wonderful things.  It even seems like the sounds all synch up when I'm stoned.  The TV talks to me.  I smoked for the first time in months the other day, downtown Oakland, and I had a blast, people were speaking my thoughts, sounds complementing my actions and I felt so alive.  I wish there was some medication that could make me feel so aware and alive without all the psycho delusions.   
I have been prescribed 2mg Abilify.

edit: audio halucinations only happen when I'm coming in and out of a dream state, I tend to dream immediately, before I'm fully asleep.  My dreams are confusingly random and often make no sense.  



edit 2:  clarifications, from comment below.

I hear/make connections constantly, unless I'm busy doing something else.  As I said in the post, durring my pot assisted delusions I started believing the universe was guiding me with sights and sounds.  It was always something I could choose to ignore until the last couple years when it became an unavoidable perception change.  Car beeps are the worst, one for yes, two for no.  Any one, two sound actually means yes or no.  At first I used the sounds like flipping a coin, I'd ask a question and let a one or two sound reply (2 caws from a crow, one bump of a tire driving by)  I became convinced the universe would communicate with me in an agreed apon fashion.   Three sounds was miracle work, four represented work, I had meanings for all numbers up to 15.  
I've come way down from where I was and now I'm mostly haunted by the ones and twos, yes and no.  While tyyping this I heard a double horn honk and had to ignore the feeling I should delete the sentence I was typing.  
This is pretty serious,  lately I've been waking up depressed and anxious fearing my own death but it improves as the day goes on.

It all started two years ago when I was nineteen starting college. I tried to kill myself in my dorm bathroom and eventually ended up at a hospital where I was put on antidepressants and the drug Invega- a known anti-psychotic. I was put on the anti-psychotic after I told my doctor I couldn't stop having racing thoughts and wasn't sleeping. After having panic attacks I was taken off this drug and diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder. I was then put on saphris and stopped taking it after a few months for different reasons. I went about a year where I had no symptoms and was on a mild anti-depressant. I was actually doing well. I managed to complete two semesters of school with a 4.0, until last March.

It was January 2014 and I had quit smoking for about a month and had broken up with my girlfriend I was dating for about four months. I started having bouts of anger. I had punched a hole in the wall and was contemplating suicide. After I calmed down I made a new friend and decided to stop taking my anti-depressant, Paxil. I was starting to enjoy life again but something was wrong. I was getting about three hours of sleep at night. 

One day I woke up in the early morning and decided to go for a drive. As I was driving I was on the phone with my friend laughing and talking the crap. I didn't realize where I was going and didn't care. I ended up driving to Port Allen Louisiana which was about two hours from my house. It was freezing but I didn't care I walked on the bank with only a  t-shirt and jeans. It looked like the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen in my life. In my mind I felt like I could feel all of the spirits that had lived in the area and that I was being drawn to them. I sat on the bank and played guitar which at the time I was very good at. My hands seemed to just move on their own and I could play very well. I got back in my car deciding to go home. My grandmother had called me and wanted me to come back, because she was getting worried. My phone was about dead and I had no charger. I told her I would head over there right away. As I was driving I had no perception of time. I had no sense of direction. I just had this feeling each time I made a turn while driving. The feeling became stronger the closer I got lost. Eventually I ended up at a person's house. 

I stopped for directions to get back home. Which was a really bad idea, but I was out of it right? At this point my phone was dead. I walked up and rang the doorbell. Soon a little dog came outside barking, then when it looked at me it turned around and whimpered away. The woman saw me and I told her where I was from and she said that she would get her husband because she is bad with directions. I became paranoid and thought that she seemed off a bit, like her smiling was very fake. She told me to come inside so I did. Her husband talked to her for a second and then he approached me. I explained to him my situation and he brought me outside. Suddenly his face grew angry and his son quickly got behind me with his arms folded. When I saw his son I got a really bad feeling and felt like he was thinking, ""what are we going to do with him."" He told me the directions but the whole time I was listening I felt like I could sense what he was thinking. What I got from this was, ""If you come back here again I'll kill you."" As soon as he finished talking I went to my car and didn't look back and as he walked past me I felt a lot of anger. 

Rationally thinking now I know that what was going on was all in my head and these people meant no harm to me. I began to drive and still lost, I ended up at a farm house and decided to call the cops. I had walked about a mile from my last stop and I was worried that the son of the man I met was following me. The police called an ambulance and they brought me to the hospital in Lake Charles, Louisiana. I spent fifteen days in the hospital without being allowed outside because the mental ward was in an upper tower of the hospital. 

My time there changed my mental state dramatically. It was a really scary time for me, I was battling demons in my head and feeling God's presence. Before this I would have considered myself an atheist. One of the patients told me she could see Jesus moving through me which made me even more delusional. But I had already been feeling like something was taking over my mind and body. Finally the day came when my insurance wouldn't pay anymore and they released me with the diagnosis of atypical psychosis. I stayed on my latuda for the next month but the delusions got worse each day I was home. I felt like I was constantly being attacked by demons at my house. I began to read the bible and fill cups of salt water around my room to ""store"" the demons. My mom was going crazy with my behavior. I was spending a lot of money on random things at the local gypsy market. I also felt each time I was in public that I was in hell and that I was there to talk with the people around me. I never spoke with them but had conversations with them in my mind. Very deep conversations. I told my mom that the medicine was making me worse and I refused to take it any longer.

She then called the police and told them that I would not take the medicine. When they got there they asked to see the medicine and told me that they weren't going to force me to take it. They then told me that I would have to go to the hospital. When I got to the hospital there were so many people in the emergency room that we ended up waiting for hours. Right before I went I saw a man with a Jewish star and many other tattoos that made me start to think. I suddenly couldn't stop thinking about Hitler and why he decided to kill the Jews. 

When the doctor asked me what I was thinking about I told him I was worried about the Holocaust and why Hitler wanted to kill the Jews. Probably not the best thing to say to make them think you aren't crazy. The nurse put me in a room and told me they wanted to keep me for a while then I could go home. My mom waited in the room with me. Then the nurse said that he wanted to move me to a more secure room. I don't know what that means. But when we got there it was dark and one wall was like a metal unloading door like for a warehouse. My mom said she was tired and needed to go home so they told me I was going to spend the night. When the door closed behind her I felt air come into the room from the metal loading door and a lifting sensation. It felt like we were rising and my imagination took hold. I thought that I had been abducted but I never told them anything about that. Finally when we ""landed"" the air stopped. The nurse came in and he had really shiny blue eyes. He said a policeman was here to bring me home. The policeman was nice and drove me. As we were driving he let me listen to music I wanted and we had a good discussion. But he wasn't bringing me home. He was bringing me to a mental hospital and I didn't realize it until we got there. I stayed at this mental hospital in Baton Rouge called Apollo for 14 days. It was the single worse time of my life. I was put on probably up to six different antipsychotics until they gave me closoril which made me very drugged and sleepy. This was shortly after I started smoking cigarettes again.

They said I was going to have to stay on it when I got out, but I decided not to because it was so harsh. I was put on lithium in June, but I soon stopped taking it and was fine. I took Summer classes in Organic Chemistry and Calculus and made As. I'm now in Organic 2 and making 100s on my tests. If anyone has any idea to why I experienced what I did, whether they think it was from quitting smoking and my medicine, I would appreciate the input. I'm currently very depressed and on Paxil again. Wishing that I could feel good again like I had before I went to the hospital. ",['conj'],0,neu_vader

I went to see my doc and asked for a change in meds and she hit me with some hard news that's leaving me kind of screwed. 

She told me that our visit was our last one because she didn't to end her practice. (it was a private practice and just her ) 

I didn't get to change my meds because of it. She gave me one day notice when I needed her most and she's leaving. Off to a new state and I am now without the proper meds and without any therapy or doctor what-so-ever. 

I got totally fucked and now I have to find a new pdoc. I don't know how long I'll be waiting for new meds but I feel screwed. 

I have a family life I need to take care of and now I have the stress of paranoia, delusions, and an increase in voices. 

I feel so lost and alone. Tossed back into the world without any direction. 

She fucked me over. 

No new meds. She gave me some xanax to help me through but it's not doing shit other than making me lethargic. 

Uhh. ",['ROOT'],0,neu_vader

But during my stay, he helped me. I quit overdosing, I ate, I slept at night, I wouldn't get panic attacks in the bathroom/shower and cut myself, and I didn't get triggered or put down by other people's bullshit.

I only had a couple slip ups. One of our roommates came in to tell us to keep it down, one night. It scared the fuck out of me, because of the way he said it, and my fiance' wasn't too happy with him about it. But he let it slide. I still have problems with controlling my drinking, and it didn't help whenever everyone around me was more than willing to join me. I literally don't know when to stop unless somebody tells me to. But at least I only got shit faced twice that whole time.

Then, I come back here to the states: every little bit of progress I DID make feels like it's vanished. I'm scared shitless of EVERYTHING. Everyone pisses me the fuck off, or I'm too afraid to even be in the same room with them for too long. I'll have brief conversations over the internet but that's about it. My phone hasn't been on for days. I can't sleep at night because my bed is too empty and my room is too quiet, compared to my fiance's house. Nightmares are coming back, it's hard to eat enough so I don't feel sick, and my medication abuse is as bad as it was when I left. The only thing that I haven't done yet is become a full on alcoholic. And that's only because I don't have the money to do it.

I have to wait at least 3 months to see him again, but that feels like such a long time, whenever all of this is happening and I haven't even been home for a week yet. I want to be a better person, and get better. But I can't do any of it by myself. I've never had therapy or a psychologist, or even meds of any kind. That's another reason I want to go live with him permanently. I don't have the resources to get any of that while I'm here. I'm trying my honest to god hardest, but I feel like I'm letting everybody down, especially him. I promised I was going to succeed and do a good job and not slack off, now look at me. I can't even fucking go outside...","['compound', 'conj']",0,neu_vader

He didn't really tell me what to do in the meantime if I get symptomatic, and I don't know that I will because it isn't a long period of time without meds, just a bit over a week.

Do you guys think I might have some symptoms throughout the week? I'm not sure what to expect, I haven't gone cold-turkey off meds or been off meds for any period of time in the last 6 months. ",['attr'],0,neu_vader
