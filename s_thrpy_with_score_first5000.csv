I was wondering if anyone could give me some tips, I trying my best to focus on the progress i made so far through therapy, yet last weekend and last night I had a bit of a set back 

to keep it brief my flatmate had some friends over (some of which i know) yet on both occasions i just stayed in my room and could not even bring my self to make even a short appearance; even just to say Hello 

This inability to talk to other people has made me feel like any progress i made so far is pretty much worthless, it's like i just barely climbed to the top of a mountain only to find that there's another one waiting for me 

i'm struggling to tell my self good things about myself with out thinking that i'm being some big headed egotistical jerk off 

I mean yeah people do seem to be genuinely happy to see me / have me around; but its like I cant see what they see 

I do realize that the feelings i have about my self are untrue; but i'm really struggling to switch my focus away from them 

(i'm really sorry, i know i said i'd keep it brief; guess that didn't quite work :-/ )

Guess my question is; how do you keep your focus on the good things ?"

We're both 18 and she's not on any medication; she's been diagnosed by her doctor but the only thing they prescribed her were phone call appointments with a therapist, which she dislikes and some sort of weekly group sessions that she only went to one of because it was not for her

I just want to make sure I'm doing everything I can to help her even as only her friend."

Things I have tried

- I go to therapy
- I take lavender/chamomile baths before bed
- I take 3mg melatonin before sleep
- Go to the gym in the evening to make myself more tired
- Drink sleepy-time tea
- Put lavender drops on my pillow
- Listen to rain noises to go to sleep
- Sometimes I'll smoke some pot to get me to relax enough to fall asleep
