1) I'm incredibly jumpy - always moving from one conversation topic to the next without much leeway or consistency

2) Experience periods of mania where I'm initially very talkative, happy, euphoric, grandiose but experience the crash where I feel very quiet, withdrawn, fucking hell, get away from me, dear goodness if you try to text me I'm going to blow a gasket

2) I rarely talk or socialize with anyone (not even my family) 

3) I hate everything

4) I always feel on edge

5) I have trouble concentrating on a task



When I'm not on the medication:

1) I have this ""get away from me"" vibe 

2) I don't enjoy anything 

3) I can't stay on task 

4) I have this feeling in my mind as though I'm always distracted

5) I can never achieve a ""flow"" state

6) I have shitty verbal communication (as in, I can't communicate)

7) I feel anhedonic

8) People have told me that I seem ""flat"", ""stagnant"", ""boring"", ""non-animated"", ""not myself""

9) I FEEL flat

10) Lazy, low energy, unmotivated

11) Poor metabolism





Social consequences:


1) I have trouble settling in anywhere

2) I sabotage my performance at work if I know I'm not going to fit in there or the time I'm going to spend there is finite

3) I don't have a boyfriend (no shit)
