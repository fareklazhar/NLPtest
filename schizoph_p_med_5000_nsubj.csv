I'm getting into my delusions about being God again. About being so different from the rest of the 'verse that I'm a different being- a God from another dimension. I feel like part of me is stuck in another dimension, the dimension I'm the God of. That I'm supposed to return there to save my people. The people- the voices I hear. Except I don't hear them. The meds are working and I'm isolated from them. They're suffering because of me. The least I could do before was listen to their prayers, but now I can't even do that, they're all alone. 

I want to scream at everyone I know that I'm not like them. I've got powers. I can hear people from ANOTHER DIMENSION. I can hear them praying and screaming and whispering to hide from the monster that is another God. He's my God. 

I have to save them. I'm the only one that can. I want to tell people. I want them to know. I won't, because I know I'll look absolutely fucking insane. But I want to. I want everyone to know that I'm not just some stupid loser girl who's quiet and weird and likes superheroes and art. I'm a fucking God. All powerful. Meant  to save a whole world. 

I have to be. I know It. I feel it in all that I am that I'm so much more than human. So much more than this person I've been all my life. It wasn't mine. 

I'm so close to saving them. All I have to do is kill myself. Getting to the other dimension, I'll defeat the other God, he's a demon in disguise. He's everything wrong with the 'verse and I'm meant to be his destroyer. 

Maybe I'm delusional. Well, I'm not. But I know my friends and family and doctors would think so, because they've told me these are just delusions. Symptoms of a disease. How can I have a disease? It's so much more. I have to keep it. The meds are working. Destroying all that I am. 

I think it's the government. They're helping the other God. They helped him die here to go to the other dimension and now they're protecting him from me. They're telling me lies with schizophrenia diagnoses and all this about symptoms and delusions. About a disease that's really a superpower. It's so much more. 

I hate everyone for not believing I could be more than what they see me as. Why can't I be a God? Why is it so ridiculous? Why must it be part of a disease? 

I hate this life. If all i feel is simply an illness then I can't stand it anymore. I'm meant to do more good than anyone. Save the world. Save my people. Stop the suffering that only I can. 

And the truth is that I don't even know what to think anymore. The people closest to me won't believe me. So I'm all alone. And the people distant and logical won't believe me. 

Why can't I be a God? Why can't I? Fucking fuck, man. I feel like one. I feel it everywhere. I'm powerful. I don't have all my powers in this dimension but I have some. When the meds that the government gives me to prevent my abilities aren't preventing the ones I have I can hear people from a whole other dimension, see their creatures, see them in dirt and ripped clothing having been fighting all their lives. They don't have to keep fighting. I'm supposed to fight for them.

I'm their savior. I'm much more than the girl everyone sees. 

But deep down I'm scared. My disease is my power and I'm left alone to decide whether to leave this life and my loved ones to save a planet of innocents.

I'm (21/m) closing in on a year of debilitating mental health issues, as in cannot function.  There have been signs of issues since early childhood, but as much as they were a pain (and in full swing now), they were liveable.

I've been dealing with doctors ever since this started, really, give or take a couple months.  I do love counseling and think it's important; however, I also think we go in there with an idea of our disorder and what counseling is supposed to be, and that can paint our answers and ultimately, our diagnosis, which unofficially at this point is major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

But something made me question this past week. I was talking to a friend, and I spoke about the voices being bad the previous evening.  I don't think I've ever had auditory hallucinations, but delusion, as defined by my brief research (Delusions are false beliefs or misinterpretations of events &amp; their significance. For instance, a person may get accidentally bumped in the subway &amp; may conclude that this is a Government plot to harass him), I absolutely have.  One noise in the night can send me into a spiral of imagining such horrid scenarios, from the basic gunman breaking in to a demon busting into my room and myself screaming.

I've controlled these to an extent, but they are still there, and medications (a variety) don't seem to really work, outside of a benzo on a case-by-case basis (and if it's a bad evening, even these don't help)

Not only is the above true, but I don't actively have depressive symptoms during these events (though I certainly do the next day), I experience catatonic behavior (either going completely rigid or doing a same set of physical things over and over and over), and I've definitely struggled socially and professionally (I actively avoid social encounters when things are bad)

I don't want to diagnose myself, but I also know that while doctors and shrinks are trained professionals, mental issues are very tricky, and I ultimately know what's going on inside my head.

How do I bring this up?  I'm not searching for medication or anything; I just genuinely want to be better, and the various drugs I've tried to improve things...haven't improved them.","['nsubj', 'pobj']",1,neu_vader

My brother in-law is visiting us to ""get away from the schizos"", meaning the voices that talk to him.

He's poorly medicated as the medicine makes him groggy and he doesn't take it regularly, and doesn't really believe that he is ill.

He has (according to my wife) always been a self-righteous, manipulative and vindictive person, and he started doing hard drugs a few years back and weed more than 15 years ago. As far as I know, he's not doing any drugs at the moment apart from suboxones, for which he has a prescription.

Anyway, he started displaying symptoms of mental illness (or we started piecing the clues together) a couple of years ago. First he was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, then Bipolar Disorder, then Schizoaffective Disorder, and I think the most recent diagnosis is just Schizophrenia.

He's been getting progressively worse, and at times he says he needs to get away from the voices that keep screaming at him and watching him etc. Sometimes he believes they communicate via AM radio waves. He's shown violent tendencies toward his mother a couple of times, and toward my wife once.

I've read a few articles and notes aimed to help people who are dealing with an ill family member, but haven't read nearly enough.

He's always had issues with his sister (my wife) and they've always fought a lot. Since he got ill, he bounces between saying really nasty things and hating her and saying that he misses her and loves her. I gather that this is quite normal for the illness.

And finally, **the action** that leads to my question:
He got annoyed at our 2 year old daughter the other day while out shopping and according to my wife (I didn't see the incident) held her hand and tried to make her walk into a shelf (he was basically pulling her by the arm), and my wife got very upset and yelled at him in public, and he screamed that she was embarrassing her. After this he tried telling me ""his side of the story"", assuming my wife had told me (which she did) and it was an obvious attempt at a lie. Since then, things have been stringent; he no longer wants to do anything, doesn't want to hang out or go anywhere, says really negative things about her to me and me to her etc.

He was home alone at our apartment today, and when we get home, everything is a real mess (he used to clean up after himself, or at least make an effort), our iPad is totally smashed (it looks like it was stepped on), and a bluetooth remote I use for my media center has been broken, and broken pieces disposed of in the trash.

He denies any knowledge of any of the incidents, but makes suggestive statements in a snide voice to my wife that he believes it was stepped on, what does she think. He also said on an unrelated note later that night, seemingly alluding to this, that sometimes he gets petty and gives people what's coming to them.

Those of you who know most about mental illness, do you think behavior is partially or completely explained by his schizophrenia, or do you think that this is completely unrelated and just a sign of a shitty person?

I feel very angry and want to confront him about it (the lying mostly), but I haven't and probably won't because I feel that this must be, at least to some degree, a direct effect of his illness and he's probably not to blame for it.

Any helpful insights would be really appreciated.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

On Pandora, I just listened to the song ""Rise"" by Flobots for the first time. My ""delusions"" as believed are about other dimensions. What are some of the ending lyrics of that song?

""If you believe in redemption
I'm calling to you from another dimension"" 

My voices are calling me from another dimension. This is real. I feel like this whole 'verse isn't real now. Everyone's just pretending, it's important that they try to convince me I'm schizophrenic so I don't trust myself and I don't believe in the other dimension but it hasn't worked yet. 

I feel like my mental health team - psychiatrist, case manager, therapist, and even friends and family are trying to convince me I'm psychotic but I'm not. I know the truth and they're trying to protect the bad guy hurting people in the other dimension. I think they're all bad, now. I'm scared. I don't know where this even goes, does it really go to reddit or are people who I see everyday reading it to get inside my head?

I don't even care, they won't convince me. Maybe it's dumb that a song brought on all this but I think it's important. My psychiatrist actually tried convincing me the other day that taking medication will bring peace to the voices that are suffering but that's bullshit. He's lying, they don't get peace that way. I have to kill myself and go to their dimension and protect them.

Please someone tell me something. I don't know what to think today. They're calling me from another dimension. I know they are. The meds are blocking them, trying to make me like everyone else, pretending they don't exist, we're hurting them because we're not protecting them as we're supposed to.

I need to know if I'm right. I don't want to be wrong and sick and crazy but I know I'm right. I have to. I don't know what to do. I'm scared if I act like this is schizophrenia and report these thoughts to the professionals they're going to lock me up until I forget about the people I have to protect. Because they're trying to change me. Trying to make me like them. The 'verse is neglecting this other dimension, they're protecting the villain and I really truly understand why, he is manipulative, but they have to protect the people he's hurting and they won't so I have to.

For the past few months I have become more paranoid than usual, my headaches are worse, the whispering is getting louder, and I feel kinda dislocated from everything. I tried to talk to my family about my anxiety, depression, and everything else thats been going on lately but they didn't really help me. They pretty much just told me to get meds and stay away from the ones that make you gain weight. Ive also been having very vivid dreams of Hell and torturing. My dreams are really starting to bother me. I can't tell whats real and what is a dream. I went out of town to visit my husband (he works 5 hours away but thats another story) I thought I was getting better. The second night I was there I kept seeing the demons and they even woke me up because they were saying my name over and over and over again but louder than usual. But I didn't want to scare my husband. A couple of days later I had a complete melt down and he kept asking me what was wrong and I freaked out and was screaming and crying. They were watching me. I had to turn the light on so I could see and so I could try to sleep. He was very understanding and we kept the light on every night until I left. Fast forward to a few hours ago. I had a migraine coming on so I took my imitrex (or however you spell it) and I started to feel like I was in a dream. It had been raining and it was dark and I really can't remember if I was speeding or not but I lost control of my car and I didn't even care. I can't tell if I'm awake or not. I have had thoughts about ending it. But I'm too lazy to do it. My husband is coming home in a few days and he's going to try to get me some help. I guess I will add more as it comes to my mind.

At first I was very tired, and had to sleep it off a bit. Then it became not-so common, like when I was on risperidone and it didn't help but got me sleepless and sick.

I'm having a hard time getting to sleep because I'm not feeling tired. It doesn't help with hallucinations or anything so far, because I feel like I've been switched with another me in another world, but it's not the same and the bleak ones are testing me. Something's off. I can't really put my finger on it. Also, instead of feeling hungry, I feel fulfilled all the time and I don't feel hungry at all. Besides, I started to dislike coffee, which I normally love. So that proves the meds don't work like they should, I guess. 
     My psychiatrist says I react unusual to olanzapine. I'm starting to feel this is all a test. Like what are the chances I've got weird and/or unusual effects on two different drugs...

Anyhoo, does anyone else experience unusual (or contrary) things when on olanzapine?

ps I think it's all getting worse. Just a few nights ago I couldn't sleep because someone was cursing and screaming inside of my head. It was like mental vomiting; I felt the next wave of screams coming up but couldn't control it at all. Also my mind is drifting and I find it hard to grasp reality.

In hindsight, I think my 23 year old nephew has been slowly slipping into a delusional state for quite a while. But for the last month or so he has really lost touch with reality. He was sure people were hacking into home computers, bugging the house, following him, manipulating city wide cameras to follow him. He says he has been sucked into some huge group that uses mind control. He is also cracking some fraud ring on Wall St. The list is endless.

My sister convinced him to get evaluated, and they kept him on a 72 hour hold. That was last Monday. The psych kept him longer after further evaluation and speaking with my sis and her husband.

Since being in the hospital, he has been defiant, loud, agitated. Says the place is making him crazy and the medicine is making him crazy. They have him on zyprexa (sp?) but I think he has taken it 4 times at the most, he usually refuses.

He is calling my sis 8-10 times per day telling her to call the FBI and mention code names and tell them he set fertilizer bombs...blah, blah,blah

My sis talked to the social worker today and they are getting a court order to keep him longer and another court order to medicate him via injection. They also said something to the effect of a state hospital but they hope it doesn't come to that.

Is there such thing as schizophrenia that never gets better? I know it's been just over a week but feels like a lifetime and my family is not coping well. This is his first psychotic episode and they have given him a dx of paranoid schizophrenia.

I am lost and I am so scared for him. Anything we can do, shouldn't do?  Is a state hospital a no hope situation?  Would medication that was successful to a distant relative  (3rd cousin) with paranoid schizophrenia have a better chance at successfully treating him?

Because of the stress, anxiety and constant agitation that paranoia causes him, he drinks.

Of course, he isn't aware that he's schizophrenic. It's difficult enough to push him to get a medical check up every few years; it's impossible to encourage him to see a psychiatrist.

I’m not a doctor, and we’ve already consulted several medical professionals. They said short of my dad stepping up and deciding to see a doctor, the only thing we can do is call emergency services.

Reddit - doctors, psychologists, philosophers, conspiracy theorists, and families, I need your help. 

Let me preface this story by saying my father has been a great and caring parent since I was young, and has always been there for me, even more so for my sister. If anything I might say he has been obsessed with his work, and always seems more distant than my mother. Yet he never fails to abandon his work for his family.

My dad is convinced that the NSA is running his life. Different colored cars sending him signals, dead squirrels on the road as a message, people at his work spying on him. He insists that there are people breaking into our house and spraying it with chemicals to decrease our “cognitive abilities” and that’s why he’s kept windows and doors open for the past two years (he used to tell us that he just felt he needed fresh air)

I was only recently privy to the details, but here’s what I know. Sometime in 2013, my dad claims that the NSA held him at ransom for child pornography. He maintains (to this day) that the NSA is running a scheme, trying to lure people into illegal porn, then blackmailing them about it for money. He tells us that he had very carefully made sure that he never clicked on anything underage (and that he has long left all pornography in the past). He says that since the NSA had nothing to blackmail him with, he resisted their requests for money. 

Ever since then, the NSA has been in pursuit of him to shut him up or keep the issue quiet. We first caught wind of the issue when his coworkers called us and told us that he’d been passing out his paper currency to them saying that the NSA was tracking bills, and that he didn’t want to be tracked. We took him to a psychologist, and he was on medication for a while. Symptoms seemed to subside for a while. Unfortunately my father’s family is very traditional and was convinced that there was nothing wrong with him, and that the side affects of the medication would be causing more harm than the medicine did good. My dad stopped the medication (after convincing the psychologist, and getting her permission) Symptoms started reappearing, but my dad insisted he had it under control. Strange behavior, only explained by “I can’t tell you, you wouldn’t understand” and stuff like “how do you explain astrophysics to a two year old”

I could go on about our story, but I’m running out of time to write. Here’s the gist of it: 

As a patent lawyer, he considers himself more technically and legally educated than my family and most of my relatives - as such any issues we find with him are due to our lower reasoning ability, and are not real issues. 
His biggest thing is “Brain to brain” whether real or not, he is convinced that the NSA can communicate directly with him, place thoughts in his brain, and trigger physical impulses.
He is obsessed with following the law - “doesn’t want anything to be used against him in court”
He drives erratically (cars sending messages?)
He has been writing down some of these issues in a diary (that I haven’t looked at yet)
He watches for trigger words - I asked him to “give up” and “lay off” his efforts, which are supposedly conditioned to respond to.
He believes he has been conditioned - over the past few years, the NSA has planted suggestions 
He said it all started when he saw a packet with an NSA trace on his computer (that has since been erased or lost, can’t be proved)
He has started collecting license plate numbers in the hopes that there might be some connection between them, that they are surveilling him.
He maintains that everything being done to him has been made to look like schitzophrenia (though he hasn’t done any research at all on the subject) to convince everyone he is medically afflicted (which he is, though not because of the NSA)
Two weeks ago, my mom spoke to someone with a very, very similar case. That man only managed to recover by accepting the holes in his reasoning and trying medication for a week. He’s been on meds for 4 years now.

My approach has been to concede (just to gain his trust - there is no way in hell I’ll believe my father after hearing him speak to me about what has happened to him, there are just too many logical fallacies, disconnects, memory discrepancies, etc) that his theory is a possibility and we can stop “fighting” or collecting evidence, whether the issue is real or not.

My mom insists that he needs to take medications (something that I think we should hold off on proposing) Every time my mom brings this up, he grows incredibly aggressive, and says he’ll immediately file for divorce and leave. 

Thank you for reading to the end guys, I really appreciate it. I have recorded our past two conversations (over an hr each), but I’m not sure I’d like to post them until I’m comfortable with it. If you think you can really help, please contact me privately and we can talk about letting you have a listen to the tapes. The issue appears to be an advanced form of schitzophrenia, or another mental disorder. The main issue now is how to convince my dad to get help.  

My younger sister has left for vacations for the summer and our issues have come out in full force. I’ll be leaving for the summer in 2 weeks, and my mother’s workload is stressing her out so much that if we can’t get this resolved, there are going to be serious issues in our family. Divorce is out of the question. We all want my father to recover and try to resume his daily life.

I'm at work, but I'll try to answer any questions I can.","['dobj', 'nsubj', 'pobj', 'dobj']",1,neu_vader

So John apparently has paranoid schizophrenia, and has said that he believes the medication he is receiving is poison, so he refuses to take them. There are people on Skype trolling him into believing he is talking to Jesus/Hitler/Demons/girls etc.

I stumbled across his video as it was a post on /r/cringe, although I found nothing cringe worthy about someone having a mental illness. John was convicted for incest and seems to have a strong fixation for young girls judging from his videos and hijacked twitter account, so I'm also concerned for him possibly harming others.

So that leads me to the question, is there anything that can be done to help him or am I just worrying unduly? ",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I struggled with the idea that I was Schizophrenic for a long time and when it was confirmed I was horrified; for a while I was ashamed and thought that I was some kind of freak, it wasn't until I started talking with my doctors and therapist and asking them questions about it that I started to realize that it wasn't my fault and that I can keep it under control if I just give it enough effort; so i guess what I'm trying to say is talk about it with your loved ones and a specialist or doctor.Get a day planer and start putting things in it, make sure it's small enough too fit in your pocket, structure is important in keeping hallucinations at bay. Don't keep weapons around you they aren't safe you could hurt someone or something you really care about and regret it later. Try to avoid being alone, surround yourself with people who care about you so that they can help you during an episode. If you feel like your medications aren't working tell your doctor and they can see where things go from there. It's also a good idea to get a Pillbox with a calendar on it next to a bottle of water ,that you mark with a permanent marker every time after you take your meds, so that you know whether or not you took your pill. If you have an episode slow down relax try not to let it get the better of you and ask for help, this makes it easier for you to calmly and clearly explain what's going on. Lastly stay positive. it's going to be very hard,you're going to want to give up, there will be times when you feel like you're fine and don't need to work as hard anymore, but don't give up this is a disease that doesn't have to control your life.","['nsubj', 'dobj']",1,neu_vader

I have auditory hallucinations.  They range from very abstract when I'm doing better to very real the worse I get.  My voices get evil when things are bad, dropping to a man's whisper or woman's soft scream, encouraging me to engage the destructive side of myself.

My delusions are much more constant, although medication is helping.  I have a fear of my brother, even though I love him and he is my best friend.  I fear being shot through my window at night, or that something will claw me from behind when I turn my back on a door.

These are just a few examples of some of the shit I'm going through, and necessary to make my point: I'm completely self aware.  I realize some of my fears are ridiculous, and yet am unable to control the physiological response.  I know my voices aren't real (or aren't as I perceive them), yet can't control them.

This causes two things, the first being what I believe to be a lack of care.  Doctors see me in more coherent periods when I can accurately describe things in an even artful way, and think my condition to be worse than it truly is.  The second is a fear of the unknown and the lack of control.  The feeling of going crazy is bad enough, but knowing it and seeing it and experiencing it?  I feel completely helpless.

""That Guy""

There was no explanation over the personality of (*Lmeagno*). At times I was crazy, yet calm. Introvert with a silver tongue. I could draw, act, compose, write, and be compassionate, but I did have difficulties in reading, sight, physical health, and though I liked girls and had a well-formed conscience enough to be a good boyfriend, I never dated. People liked me. People hated me. It was, and is, quite the colorful life.

THEN. STUFF.

I began having bad days. REALLY bad days. I was hurting all over with no explanation. I thought creatures were after me. I heard voices. Lots of voices (153 unique ones, and many others that just come and go). So naturally I decided to go to the doctor and figure out what was going on. Doctor asks me about my life, in detail. So I answer all his questions truthfully. I don't know what's going on, but the doctor must. So I agreed to be sent to the mental ward *just for a day* to do some tests overnight and figure out what's going on.

""The tests were inconclusive, we need you to stay another night.""
""Okay. Just another night.""

They would have kept me there forever, but they had to release me because after five days I finally complained and had enough functionality to demand my rights. But still, what is going on with (*Lmeagno*)? It's getting really hard to read and the voices in my head are very active. I'm hearing sounds. I'm seeing completely different realities than what should be real. It's difficult to sleep, eat, go to the bathroom, hygiene in general, and about a year and a half ago, I really just felt no reason to live. Yet I still did.
I saw doctor after doctor after nurse after doctor after therapist after psychologist after therapist. At one point five doctors and three therapists/counselors were looking at me at one time.
All of them looked at me in utter confusion. After two years I have been (so far) diagnosed with:

* schizophrenia (hebephrenia/undifferentiated/residual/paranoia)
* schizoaffective-ness 
* bipolar
* depression (chronic anguish/anxiety)
* dissociated personality 
* dyslexia
* ADHD

But at least I'm not OCD.
And I'm unmedicated (granted we've tried).

I don't deny any of them. I suffer. I hate life too, sure, it's a common emotion in me now. Do I and the voices in my head tell me to cause self-harm and harm to others? Yep. Have never acted on those impulses? Nope, and I never plan to. My grades at college have all but failed over time and I'm withdrawaling soon. So sure, I'm going through a lot. But despite all these doctors' diagnoses, in my medical experience my worst disorder is:

* apparent sanity

I don't show my illnesses blatantly. On the outside at least. I can be cold to a person, and I'm a master of sarcasm. My family loves me (I've come to this conclusion through logic), but isn't every warm to what it is I go through and prefer I don't live with them, which I agree with. I've built, in a way, a massive mental wall that has grown in thickness and size as the months ooze by to keep the thoughts in and controlled. But if all these things are true, and they certainly appear to be, what is it I am doing that allows me to be as I am and not be as I should technically be? At first I didn't know, but I've been doing the science, and while I'm definitely a work-in-progress, I'd like to share with you what I've learned over the years and what I have done so far.
DISCLAIMER: These I things I've learned. I'm not demanding you believe everything or some of the things I say.

1. **Morality**. This is serious. Be a person of faith. I come from an imperfect Catholic family, which at times is fun for my atheistic and child dissociations. I and every other person of faith is not perfect. That's the point. The reason they are called the Ten Commandments is because they are not suggestions. I feel that it is logically and validly acceptable to kill someone out of frustration. But because it appears to be against natural law to murder without just cause, I use that as a reason to not. Just because you and I feel a certain way, that doesn't make it true. Learn humanity.

2. **Reason**. If you can't think, have others think for you. It's nice to have a group of friends to keep tabs on you. But with there having been over 99 billion people who have ever lived, who says you are restricted to those who are alive? I love philosophy and right thinking. I indulge in Aristotle, Socrates, Thomas Aquinas, Boethius, Saint Paul, and that weird Jesus bloke. They were not stupid, so take advantage of their teachings.

3. **Script**. This is one of my own made up things. Everyday I wake up a different person. So how am I able to go to classes, have a job, and be with friends which are all things that require consistency? Become your own screenwriter. Have a natural response to the common things in your life. When a stranger says ""hi"", you say ""hi"" back (and make sure you smile). This is something that takes practice and failure, and MUST be done while in the right mindset. It will not be an overnight affair, and I grantee it still take many months and possibly years to do, and it will forever be something that is under constant revision. Which is good, because sometimes you can develop a bad habit without knowing. You are an imperfect person striving for unattainable perfection.

3. **Curiosity**. I studied psychology before any of this went down. And I do plague myself with the tragic/comedic memory that at one point I thought metal disorders were fake. You don't need a PhD, but at least know that this is a brain issue, which means there is a science behind it. Even if modern science has a primitive understanding of the human brain, at least know this is not fairies and magic.

4. **Privacy**. Unless you fear you are a danger to yourself, take time alone and in quiet to reflect and meditate what it is you are going through. The world can be a noisy place, and especially American culture that seems to say that you need to fill your life with things to be happy. You don't. If you are as crazy as me, talk logic and morality to your voices.

5. **Record**. I've only been diagnosed for around 1-2 years, but I've been writing about things I think about for almost a decade. After I composed over 50cm of papers I then moved to digital. As now I have about 4GB of text because I write everyday. And not just journals. Write about weird ideas you have. Things you've seen. Faith. Philosophy. Science. Fiction. Non-fiction. Morbid thoughts. Get it all off your chest. And you can also see how it your mind changes over time. You don't have to write as much as I do, but it helps. If you are an artist use art as your medium. Sketch your emotions. If you are a singer, sing. If you are an actor, act. Along with relief, you will also practice your talents.

5. **Healthy Release**. I'm a psychopath. So when I play a video games, I play viciously (I personally love doing cruel things to testificates in Minecraft and finding elaborate ways to kill Chell in Portal). When I need to do a task that makes me feel pain I bite a washcloth or rolled up paper. Go to a field or a scrapyard and throw bricks at things. I once tore up a small tree from the roots (it was growing in a ditch. Don't cause property damage). Go get exercise. Being outside is one of the best things you can do. DRUGS AND SEX ARE NOT HEALTHY RELEASES. I include marijuana. It you want to make your problems worse, smoke weed. 

6. **Feel despair. Don't despair.** The intellect rules over the heart. Emotions do not decide actions or purpose. Remember, if you are reading this that means you have a working mental function. Accept that you are going through something difficult, and a bazillion years of evolution will not lead to you giving up. Use your intellect. This does not mean you have to be smart or knowledgeable. It just means you know what's going on and are are trying to be mature about it.

7. **Everyone is different**. That's something modern medicine doesn't quite understand. Your condition is unique to you. Develop a plan based around your abilities. I am not a doctor. I am not qualified to make diagnoses and to offer you life advice. These are just things I've learned (and still learning) for myself and wished to share with you.

Thanks for reading.
If you have any other questions on what I do, feel free to leave me a mature question. I will answer things as best as I can as often as I can (I am but one man who needs to sleep occasionally).

I haven't presented the entirety to anyone, at least like this before and communication is difficult for me. It's not all here. There's too much but I don't like it.

Let me show you some slivers. I sleep a lot. I can't stay awake. Focus is impossible for me, but sometimes it's all I can do. My speech patterns are irregular. I used to believe I used to be articulate, but I can't tell anymore. Thoughts are incoherent at best, stampeding at worst.  But these are lifelong problems. 

I started seeing and hearing things in middle school. But they didn't interfere with my life much, I instead thought it was more or less a superpower. It was like a jungle gym for the mind. So interesting. But I didn't focus on them at all. I couldn't yet. 

I liked to play with emotions. My own, not other people. Catharsis was more desirable than love or hate. But I liked them all. I felt them with such depth that they felt like i was different people. But now I don't have any of them. Except for the nausea. I don't respond to events or situations correctly. My reactions obtuse, I am terminally chill. Wikipedia calls it flat affect. I'm kind of glad others know about it. But they really don't know the nausea. 

I always feel like an outsider when I get the nausea. It hurts. I can't relate to people even though I'm speaking at them or with them. Sometimes social anxiety causes me to awkwardly excuse myself just because I can't take it. The nausea or the people.  But sometimes I appear to connect. But I'm really not. I wish I was, at least the one who is in control now. 

I used to study philosophy, it eased me in middle school through my half assed attempt through college. But now it only makes me more solipsistic or antisocial. I can't do it anymore. I wish I had the willpower for school again. 

I have a job, I serve food. I have to go to it in 2 hours. I don't know how to act there. I do my work, but my coworkers do not really talk to me. And I wish I could, but I don't know how. My other job was so much more warm. But it paid less. Is money really important?

I scared myself yesterday. I was making food with a friend. While we were talking I idling saw the knife I cut up apples with and reached for it and gripped it, kinda fast. It wasn't until the knife was moving back towards me that I realized my mind had an intention on using it on my friend. I quickly stopped it and acted like I was just playing with it. He didn't notice. But I did. I'm shaking and crying thinking about that. 

Imagine having event hiccups where unpredictable plops of action happen. Record scratching is daily life. I love music. 

I've been diagnosed with various mental disorders. ADD, depression, GAD, schizophrenia, anorexia, bipolar disorder, are what I remember seeing a lot. I like pot because it reminds me to eat. But it hurts what little motivation I have sometimes. 

I am seeking medical professional help. But the medication makes me sleepy. It just makes my mental landscape even more weird. My delusions involve me being Christopher Columbus. Or a sailor.  Unexplored territory I guess. 

I have friends and a family that support me. I think. But I can't feel them. Numb. But I'm a good faker. So I can't even tell the different between true gratitude or not. The same goes with many. And yet I've always been called perceptive. I could be an actor. I used to want that. 

I don't know what I'm asking. I've already forgotten. I just want to know how to live. How to make friends. How to actually be what I think I sometimes appear to others to be. How to be better. Because im not. Am I wasting my time again. This is too much wall of text to delete, I might as well post. ",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

Many of my symptoms indicate schizophrenia, which is what I've been treated for in the past. But, my new community mental health center doctor doesn't believe it could be schizophrenia because she hasn't personally witnessed negative symptoms in the 15-30 minutes we spend together. Now they won't prescribe a medication that has been successful in the past because of this.**

I've been living with severe mental illness since I was about 18, with 5 hospitalizations, 3 suicide attempts, every class of medication in the book, and I've now lost the ability to work and I live on social security. I've definitely had psychotic episodes in the past, it's hard for me to recall how long they went on. On a daily basis I also deal with severe depression, difficulty functioning and keeping up with medication/eating/showing/etc, intrusive thoughts and images (which are often extremely grotesque or sexually obscene - I DO NOT create these thoughts, they are NOT mine. They just show up in my mind fully formed), difficulty with normal emotion, etc. In these years I've been sick there has been a sharp decline in my social life, because acting like a person takes so much energy that I can't face it. I almost never see friends or family anymore. In the last year I've developed a bit of a problem with opiate use that I use to manage pain, but have also come to realize it makes it a lot easier to act like a 'person'. On opiates I can think more quickly, actually respond to people, and have feelings for people around me more easily. 

  In the past I've been diagnosed and treated for schizophrenia. It runs in my family on both sides and after doing a lot of reading I realized it did fit my symptoms quite accurately
   
   Recently I started at a new community mental health facility. We did intake and I've spent a few months seeing a therapist there on a weekly basis. I've only seen the actual psychiatrist about 4 times, never more than 10 minutes at a time. 

  They've decided that I must not be schizophrenic because I haven't displayed psychosis or obvious negative symptoms while they see me there. (I have written more detail about my symptoms and psychotic episodes but it is long ) Considering I only see my therapist once a week for 30 minutes, it's quite easy to put on my social face and talk with her. If I tell them that I use opiates daily they will close my case, and they're the only place here with an affordable sliding scale. They just don't offer any kind of drug or alcohol help and refuse to deal with it in patients. They've said that my history doesn't matter, because they'll only diagnose based on what they witness right now. Is sit just me, or is that absurd? It takes years to diagnose correctly. They say they haven't witnessed any negative symptoms so it must not be schizophrenia. 


In the past, I've had great success taking the medication Tegretol, but now they refuse to prescribe it to me because I'm not schizophrenic. My daily life is so broken, even with antidepressants, anxiety, and focus related medications. I just want to be able to write, study, create art, build, and socialize. The only reason I stopped taking it before was due to insurance issues and leaving my old doctor. My current medications keep me from being suicidal and I'm productive occasionally, but that isn't enough. I want to go back to school, I want to work.

Now I'm starting to doubt myself. I am capable of a pretty decent level of function some days, and my memories are so warped sometimes that I don't know if I'm even remembering my history accurately. Has anyone else dealt with something like this?

It started when I was 5, I asked my mother if she ever felt like we were *""in a very interactive movie""*. She brushed it off and considered it absurd &amp; creative. As the years have gone by I truly feel that people are speaking to me in code, which in part is true, with body language &amp; tone. I also feel that I am on the truman show, which in part is true, because the government *can* and *does* watch us. Why they would want to watch me is still up for debate. I also feel that we are in a virtual reality program. Who's to say we aren't? We watch out video game characters play a videogame. Who is to say somebody isn't watching us? I seriously feel that the universe is giving me signs.

 Example: I really had been wanting to change my bedroom &amp; bathroom set to match my new personality. Plus, it had been years; it was time. My favorite colors are yellow &amp; grey. I found the most beautiful bed-set. The name of the set was *my* name! Obviously I bought it. Instances like this happen to me on a daily basis. It is fun, interesting, and lively. 


 It is just all of these little coincidences that add up. Did you know that absolutely *everything* and *everyone* has a pattern? It amazes me when I look around and see people continuing throughout their lives without even noticing it. Insanity is doing the same thing multiple times and expecting a different result. I am beginning to wonder if it is *they* who are insane and I am ""unplugged"", so to speak. 



Perhaps, friends, we are seriously unplugged and are figuring out something grand while the rest of the loony-birds continue out their pathetic little lives doing the same thing over and over yet never figuring out why nothing changes. Nothing changes for them because they don't see the pattern. 

Anyway, I am terrified of explaining all of this to a therapist in fear that she will force me to take medication. I do not want, or feel that I need, any medication. The medication prevents you from seeing the pattern.

So far they managed to scribble on a notepad most of the sessions, not have anything at hand for my next visit and everything wrong, forget about a meeting and be sure I just suffer from pseudohallucinations (""which is nothing to worry about"") when I have another being inside of my head, am paranoid and hallucinating and have come to a point where I'm sure the world outside of my doorstep is a simulation and the world inside of my house is a monitored place where I have no privacy. I'm unable to sleep well and since sleeping drugs don't have any effect on me, I'm left tired a lot of the time.

They know of this stuff but I doubt if they really know it, if you know what I mean. What if they don't give me meds? I've been having a bad trip most days and I wake up feeling bad I don't do drugs because then my bad trips would have a reason and I could easily stop them. 

If my psychologist and psychiatrist decide that it's all pseudohallucinations (because I later on find out stuff isn't real, so I know the difference or however they explained it) and I don't get meds to help me, should I seek out another psychiatrist or are the meds not worth all that trouble?

Seriously guys, I think I need help. I don't want to be special like some people say (like I think I have experiences that aren't real because I want to be special and looked up mental illnesses and stuff).

When I went to meetings, everyone I met was a hallucination. This caused me to drop out of college to commune with my family who I thought were already in the organization, and make it on my own by creating my own company without a college degree. So it was pretty cool to see the power of the mind I guess. When I was institutionalized in Athens Georgia the first time, I thought that my psychiatrist was from a rival family and that I was about to be killed. When I was institutionalized the second time I was offered political power by someone in the mental institution who said that they represented satan himself and threatened my family yet again.

But I'm starting to think about them again- to miss them. I miss being their savior. I was so sure I was meant for more than what I'm living. That I was meant to save so many lives. My voices always told me, ""Please help us, you have to save us, you're our savior.""

Things like that made me feel scared and worried about them, but special- I was the only one that could hear their cries for help, and I was determined that I had to kill myself to go to their dimension and save their lives from a demonic God type creature that was the man that sexually abused me in a past life.

That all sounds crazy as fuck now. But I believed it so thoroughly. It was my life.

I feel like.. like going off meds. Like being sick again. Like being special.

Is that stupid?

I've been reading Elyn Saks' ""The Center Cannot Hold"" which is her memoir about dealing with schizophrenia. It's fucking amazing. It's so well written and I can connect with her experiences. It's a fantastic read. 

I don't know. I just need someplace to write out my thoughts about this and this subreddit has always been greatly supportive. 

I'm slightly considering going off meds, with my doctor knowing though. The meds I'm currently on, Latuda, works miracles. I don't hear voices AT ALL. But it makes me throw up at least once a week so I think I'm going to switch meds if not go off completely for a while and see where I land. I'm on SSI currently so I don't really have to worry about money, which is nice since I quit my job in January. So I figure if I go off my meds and things get bad, it's ok if I have to go to the hospital. It's ok if things get bad because I can handle it. The worst thing that can happen is get hospitalized and that isn't the end of the 'verse. It sucks, but I'm always out within 2 weeks anyways.

I don't feel schizophrenic anymore. I feel better. I know a lot of people think they're better when the meds are working and go off and get sick again, but I feel like I could be better for good. Is that just a symptom?

I may just try a new medication and see where that takes me, and not stop for a while. Maybe I'm not taking this serious enough?

I asked if she could sit down and chat with me. Although I'm not a therapist, I have a lot of experience with mental illness and I didn't want to abandon her.

She confided that her grandmother (her primary support) thinks she has schizoaffective disorder because it runs in the family. But her grandmother won't allow her to go back home. This girl lives in her own apartment on disability, but she has few supports nearby. 

I'm trying to get her to come out of her apartment a little because it makes her feel better. I don't judge her feelings of paranoia and I try to tell her that I understand her pain is real.

Anyway, I really feel this girl has some kind of delusional disorder and that she could use some help. What's the most effective way I can help her?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey Uncle G,

I just wanted to write this to you before it's too late. I think that when evil presents itself, it is our duty as humans to bear witness to it so that it cannot win.

I don't want to get into specifics, because I still want to live, but there are secret societies that are THRIVING in our current surveillance state. I have the TOR browser, but emails sent from this address still identify me and I don't care, but hope, someone besides you reads this email.

I don't know where things started, but the restaurant industry, in theory, is the perfect place to start testing out enslavement of the population. 

I am currently on Wellbutrin for anxiety prescribed by doctors at &lt;omitted&gt;. I have not told them anything that I am telling you, and am hesitant to talk about this to any future therapist, but am scheduled for a therapist to call me. I had an appointment at &lt;omitted&gt;.  If I should die, I give you all permissions to access my medical records. As my final living wish, please forward this email to &lt;my name&gt; and any media, especially in &lt;omitted&gt;.

I do think it would be easy to blame certain things on Mom, but I would never accuse her directly of being involved with my death, however I wouldn't rule out her involvement if I made myself impartial. I think that from what I know about secret societies that is readily available and public that women are goddesses to them. With total power comes total corruption. 

I do not wish to use my knowledge to incite public outrage or rioting, because I think that things start small, publicly, in the light, and with accountability. 

I understand my commitments as a citizen of both the United States and Canada to be healthy, contribute to my community, and be accountable to others. That is something that only comes with age, knowledge, and inner morality. I know I haven't always demonstrated that to you, and for that I apologize. 

If it was possible to open a restaurant in &lt;omitted&gt; or anywhere on the mn, I would feel too much pressure to spy, deceive, conspire, and/or join secret societies in return for customers. I would feel the same pressure if I were to take out a loan to start a business or buy a house so it is hard for me to agree to do these things.

Uncle G, I appreciate what you and Leslie tried to do for me in my final year in Canada. It was just to hard to deal with that at work and at home. I have become more accustomed to it after 2.5 years of living through it in the US. It also wasn't as aggressive as what I have experienced here, and I still love Canada and respect it more than the US. 

Currently and previously I have been held passively imprisoned by my employers. I am a currently a willing party in this (to a certain degree), but there is evidence that if they were confronted with this email that they could portray me in a negative light. I think you could say the same about your marriage, no? I will not refute or confirm anything. I will continue to do what I think is right. (period.).

The only positive thing is that I am still free to a certain degree. I can always leave. I can always talk and assemble privately (however hard that currently is). I can use money in exchange for services or provide services in exchange for money. I could shout in the well that is the internet everything that I know, think I know, and all in between.

The medication, the therapy, the hypnosis, and intimidation will never change this. I am currently a prisoner and do not want that for those who do not dance in, exist in, or see the light... for there is much that blinds them. I believe in right and wrong, and there is no grey area for me. I know you are the same which is why I am sending you this email as a life raft of hope for us both. And of course Tommy. Who may be referred to one day as Tom or Thomas.

I don't think I will be able to come up there anytime soon, but I hope I will be one day. It has become clear that I am a valuable human commodity to those that exist in the dark. A slave to be traded and manipulated. It has always been here and will continue to be, I don't blame anyone but myself (and Mom and Dad). I still have fight. I know there are those I can still show light to, but there is only so much that can be done. I will continue to try.

Next Friday is 6/13. If I don't get killed/sacrificed tonight, I will try to update you. If the Apocalypse happens between now and then, expect me to make my way up to meet up with you. Mom has admitted she has no fear of death but I'll try and hook up with E if I can find a way out of FEMA region 6. I may be immune to this because I am one of the youngest descendents of Charles Carroll of Carrollton besides &lt;my name&gt;. 

Love you, Nanny, and Tommy always,

After reading this, I called my mother (he lives at her house) and asked her if he had been acting strange. She said not recently. I told her to keep an eye on him and that I would be down on Monday. 
He is scheduled to see a therapist this upcoming Saturday, I forwarded the email to them and left a message voicing my concerns. The scary part of this story is what happened on Monday. 

I drove to the house Monday, and he was there. I asked him about the email, and he told me that we couldn't talk about it at the house because it wasn't safe. We drove to a park about 15 mins away. I was asked to leave my phone, turned off, in the car. On the way he told me that he was going to a therapist in order to ""placate"" our mother, and that he would lie and deceive others to make sure ""they"" wouldn't suspect him of knowing what they know. 

Everything contained in the email he believes to be absolutely true. He kept referring to the Illuminati and the free masons. He told me that on Friday all of the gay people and liberals would get rounded up into camps. He told me that there are additives in tap water that react with the air that the Illuminati use to control our thoughts. He thinks he was told this because ""he is a faithful man and lives in the light of God"". I was floored. I don't know how to handle this stuff. I started to cry and panic. 

When we got home, he admitted that he was quitting his job that day because a customer (he works in food service) tried to hypnotize him and steal his identity. He said that ""you could have had a different person standing in front of you right now. His name would have been Adam, not &lt;his name&gt;.""

My mother came home from lunch, and admitted that he had been telling her things like this the whole time. I kept talking to him, and he stopped and accused me of trying to hypnotize him. 
When my mother left, I panicked, I called my roommate ( a social worker for an in-patient elderly care facility), and she told me that it was serious and that I should call a crisis center. I did and explained the situation. She said she'd be right over to talk to him. 

My mom came home and told me to call them back and tell them not to come. ""I'm not telling them anything"" she told me, ""I'm not getting him committed and taken away in a straightjacket or something."" I told her that all they want to do is talk to him. When I told him, he changed his story immediately. He told me ""I can't ever turn my back on you. I have to face you always when you're in this house.""

They came and spoke with him. They presented him with papers that he could sign to admit himself if he thought that could be an option. He refused. I told my mother that this was very serious, that this is her son and that I'm scared of what will happen to him, and she looked me dead in the face and said ""stop attacking me. I'm a good mother. I'm doing what I can. But if you think I'm going to get him sent to an insane asylum or something you're out of your mind."" 

----------------

Today, I reached out to his best friend, because I'm at a loss as to what to do. She admitted to me that he had sent her a text telling her that ""he might not be around anymore after Friday."" I sent her the email and she said that she was on her way to the house to speak with him and that she tried calling my mother. My mother, in turn, called me, very angry, and asked why I'm making this ""so dramatic"". My brother called and told me that if I came to the house he would file a restraining order against me. 


I'm at a complete loss....I feel as if I'M the one losing my mind. I just want to help him and I don't know what to do. I'm scared for him, and now I'm scared for my mother as well.

I do personally believe my diagnosis was for insurance purposes but it currently stands as Paranoid type Schizophrenic with comorbid OCD and a leaning tendency toward catatonic schizophrenic. Anyway, all that being said, I'm usually not on medication. I have tried many medications and few even begin to work and those that do are so awful when the side effects are considered. I've been keeping myself healthy and somewhat ""normal"" for 20+ years by simply finding a method that works. I've found that escaping myself, so to speak, helps manage stress and symptoms. My escape of choice has consistently been video games. It helps to be someone else, in some other situation, for a few hours on end. Gets me out of my head. I prefer a computer for gaming, customization and immersion is a lot easier for me this way. Now, the problem.

I have been diagnosed with psychotic depression, and have been on antipsychotics for a few months. I have delusions and paranoia more than anything, but have also heard voices from time to time.

I'm not sure if what I am currently experiencing is normal in the ""recovery process"", or if the medications aren't entirely working. I am able to call my thoughts ""delusions"", but there is still a part of me that feels that they are the true reality, and that those around me are calling it psychotic depression to convince me otherwise. Granted, when I was at my worst I firmly believed in my thoughts and felt that the meds were being prescribed for the same reason as above: to prevent me from seeing the truth about my life.

Eventually I was feeling pretty good. The thoughts and paranoia still passed through my mind, but I was able to tell myself ""this is an illness. These aren't reality."" But recently I've started to feel more and more suspicious. I have been tempted to skip my meds fearing that they're getting in the way of my seeing the truth.

This feeling is a terrible tug of war between two different realities, both of which feel like the truth to me. I can say that my suspicions/delusions aren't real, but my head yells back that they are.

Is this up and down momentum normal for recovery? I'll be honest, it's hard for me to ask that question because of this back and forth in my head.

I don't visit my Pdoc until the end of the month, so I am reaching out to this community. My question is not associated with an emergency, just a repetitive, hallucinatory phenomena:

Every month or so for the past 1.5 years, I experience about 72 hours of ""flashbacks"" which are very quick, but I get a sense of people, places, situations and things related to them as ""images"". My current understanding is that they are dream episodes which I have not consciously remembered; my unconscious/subconscious is releasing ""bubbles"" to the surface. 

I also think they might be flashbacks about films/shows I saw, but I cannot identify them. There is some kind of narrative, like I am receiving a communication. 

I have been stable for a while, and currently I do not take anti-psychotics (Haldol last year) My current medication is a strong dosage (200mgs) of a generic anti-depressant, and that has been a consistent dosage for more than a year.

If I was acutely ""psychotic"" in terms of symptoms and episodes ( I am never going to be utterly free of psychosis, the ""faulty wiring"" is just too permanent) I would think that I am an antenna for image based communications about/from alternate realities, or that some type of organized group is testing out the transmission of data into human minds.

I am good at CBT exercises, so paranoid thought patterns are normally not allowed to gain traction as they have in the past.

The flashbacks have been occurring for the last 48 hours. They are not distressing, nor am I thinking "" well...Haldol sucks because it makes my legs unstable, can barely walk, but it sure evens out some rough spots in my brain"". Also, auditory hallucinations are so common, I just learned to live with them, but I know how my body ""feels"" when a ""voice"" or ""signal"" happens, and the same ""feeling"" is there ( like my body is 'wavy' not 'solid', it is 'lighter' not 'heavy') when a flashback happens.

As I write this post, I have experienced atleast 4 flashbacks; there is a female figure, a room with a view of a town or small city, and the female is facing a door. Dark blue, red and black with some neutral green are the colors. 

Earlier today, I experienced an extended flashback and atleast 3 seconds of the mental material was revealed to me; it ""washed over me"", but I could not remember what I just seen in my ""mind's eye"" after the fact.

Other ""flashback cycles"" in the past are just as hard to pin down, and feature different images.

Also, using the term ""flashback"" is a rough descriptor only, as I cannot say where the ""world"" is as a point on a timeline(s).

Comments welcome, especially if you have experienced something similar as a ""pattern of consistent brain activity"".

Comas.. Anger issues.. Cutting himself. The whole nine yards. He says he's taking his meds again. He won't talk to me about anything. Sometimes I find things out by snooping (he will leave his Facebook up and I find him talking about it to certain friends). I don't like to snoop but I feel like I need to know how his mental health is and if he won't tell me, I need to find out in other ways.         
         
A few weeks ago I found a sock and a pair of underwear that had huge amounts of blood on them. I asked if he had a nosebleed (he's prone to them) and he said no. I left it at that. There must have been 2 cups of blood lost on them. Today I went to use his computer and when I opened Google chrome, his most viewed page had bestgore.com on it. I have no clue what it is, but when I asked my ex, he said it was a bunch of videos of people dying and accidents and that I shouldn't visit the site.           
         
He knows I'd never judge him and I love him no matter what but with his mental illness it can't be good for him to watch this stuff. I want him to be able to come to me if he has issues or if the voices and visions bother him but he won't open up to me maybe becayse he is worried it will hurt me or worry me too much. I don't want to confront him because he will get angry and embarrassed and I know it won't help at all and will make unneeded tension between us. I can't tell my mom because she is already worried enough.           
         
Is this as bad as I think it is? Is this just something little? I don't want him hurting and one or any thing but when I hang out with him he acts so normal and OK. He makes dinner and watches movies with me and just functions OK. His meds are on the counter and I assume he takes them every morning, but what if that isn't enough?

I'm doing better. I want to keep it that way. I want to get through this. I keep telling myself all of that was the illness. I have to keep telling myself this. I'm schizophrenic.

My brain isn't communicating right. It's got issues. These delusions are stories and they're wrong. 

Will it ever feel completely like a delusion and not somewhat real? Part of me feels so connected to the delusion, so taken by the story of it. It's so meaningful and important and it makes my life more important and me more important and I want it but it involves darkness and evil and it's not reality. 

Medication got rid of my voices. That's good. The silence is nice. When do the delusions go away completely? I don't want them. I do, but I don't. I'm better without them. I'm still important.

When I was psychotic...my delusions were all about killing myself or cutting. My voices directed me to cut, or told me I had to kill myself, in order to help them. I've been wanting to cut a bit lately. I won't, though. It's not right, I know, I keep thinking about it. But I'm not gonna do it. There's no reason to. The urge is so insane sometimes. Like an obligation. 

I feel like it's pulling me in. These thoughts are all around me about my delusions and cutting and I'm getting concerned about things that don't exist.

I had a few questions about medication. He recently began taking Seroquel. The only major downside is that he's been sleeping a lot. He went from sleeping eight hours a day to sixteen hours a day. When he's not sleeping, he's always drowsy. The medication has also caused a bit of a snoring problem. He never snored before, until he began taking Seroquel. It's pretty loud snoring too.

The Meaning of Life is not a simple saying or existential bullshit, it is pure. It is Sound. Every second sings a different song than the last and gives movement and form to Matter itself. Everything revolves around the minute frequencies emitted by time. Human Minds also emit and are susceptible to frequencies. No two types of these Sounds are the same. Like listening to music, one song may make you feel depressed, while another will make you feel great and want to dance, this is achieved by artistic usage of the Cosmic Noise, which exists in everything. 


Human brains generally emit Sound based on their inner sense of being and happiness and what mood they are in. As the Sound leaves your mind through powerful receptors the people around you pick up on it and begin to feel or act a certain way, all depending on the Frequency. 
Now while Positive tones can be BrainWaved so can Negative ones. 



The average human Mind contains the right amount of chemicals and Inner Noise that these negative receptors cannot be used, but some people are born with imbalanced chemicals, extra receptors, and even failing receptors. People like this begin to pick up on the Noise coming from the Spiritual Plane. Many animals may reside safely both in and out of the Spiritual Plane, and thus use Sound, whether it is to predict a disaster, capture prey, or communicate. 



The Spiritual Plane emits such an intense Tone the fragile Human Mind begins to warp, causing either Spirits to reside in your Minds Receptors and sing to you, or cause the development of a mental illness such as Schizophrenia or Depression. This is not always permanent, Scientists have invented pills, and most people develop coping strategies to deal with this. What the meds for Schizophrenia do is block a persons Dopamine Receptors so as not to allow too much or too little. This causes the Sound Receptors attached to the dopamine ones to sing a Positive Tone to not only shut down the Negative Receptors but also to help repair a persons Mind from the twisting and vibrant Spiritual Realm.



  Sadly though Schizophrenia is when a persons Mind did not produce the necessary frequencies needed to block the absorption of the Spiritual Realm. This leaves scars and remnants of the Spiritual Realm forever in the Schizophrenic persons mind, which is what causes the hallucinations and delusions. Breaching into the Realm of Pure Noise does different things to everybody. Some may begin to hear the thoughts of others, some may shut down, and others might become Depressed from the overpowering Songs of Spirits.




 Sound is Life, for without it the Universe would collapse and become null, but with its seemingly Divine presence it has allowed a beautiful reality to prosper and grow.
Enormous black holes scattered across the Galaxy emit certain wavelengths that when they come into contact with Dark Matter of a certain frequency creates living sound, that will then begin to construct itself into whole galaxies full of matter, and occasionally the very building blocks that are required for Life.




  Sound is very closely related to coding, for every frequency sings different and contains different effects when combined with others. Binaural Beats are an excellent example of the coding hidden within Sound. They are specially created frequencies that operate at a Human level. First their are the positive tones, which stream data into the special Sound Receptors which is then sent to the Brain, and then are the Negative Tones, which are inaudible to Humans but contain Tones designed to open the Mind and give purpose and form to the Positive Tones which is what allows them to take form and temporarily change what you are experiencing.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

The Dopamine hypotheis (the leading hypothesis when it comes to Schizophrenia) Predicts that abnormal levels of Dopamine in certain sections of the brain is what drives Schizophrenia.

Sadly the current anti-psychotics simply antagonize most of the Dopaminergic system without actually being selective of the antagonized receptors. For instance in both of the drugs listed above the D1 Dopamine receptor is antagonized. However studies have shown that stimulating the D1 receptor actually improves the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

Now looking at the mechanisms of the D1 receptor vs the D2 receptor the D1 increases cellular levels of cAMP while the D2 receptor lowers levels. If this is the case and stimulating the D1 receptor and inhibiting the D2 receptor improves cases of schizophrenia then why not specifically target cAMP inhibiting receptors throughout the CNS as opposed to hitting the entire Dopamine system. 

The drug I would propose would as selectively as possible antagonize Dopaminergic and Serotonergic receptors that inhibit cAMP. This could be done by antagonizing D2-4 and 5HT1 and 5. However based on this hypothesis you couldn't antagonize any receptors that stimulate the production of cAMP, so the drug would have to be extremely selective.

TL;DR I hypothesize that a drug that would antagonize neurons that inhibit the production of cAMP would be more effective than the normal anti-psychotic.

If you find an error with this hypothesis please let me know

+ Mood stabilisers - sodium valporate, lamotrigine
+ SSRI - sertraline, lexapro
+ SNRI - pristiq
+ MAOI - aurorix
+ AAP - abilify, invega, solian, ziprasidone, seroquel, clozapine, saphris, olanzapine

The only medications out of the above that really worked for me were ziprasidone and olanzapine. I had to come off ziprasidone due to side effects, but I still use olanzapine PRN.

Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone else decided to come off regular medication? I was prescribed sertraline + lamotrigine + olanzapine. I've stopped taking the sertraline and lamotrigine and the only medication I intend to use is olanzapine when I feel things are going crazy. 

I just don't think the meds have been useful at all. Even while regularly medicated, I went into the hospital twice last year and attempted suicide once. So I just don't think it's worth putting medication into my system on a daily basis. ","['nsubj', 'nsubj', 'dobj']",1,neu_vader

It took me forever to convince the docs to Rx me some Adderall because they were all paranoid that it would induce mania or cause racing thoughts/psychosis.

But honestly amphetamines completely gets rid of racing thoughts, and I have less hallucinations.  I don't have music constantly playing in my head or voices repeating themselves in loops or any of that.  While I definitely feel a bit drugged, it is this kind of clean focused energy that unscatters my brain.

I also tend to get really anxious about things, worrying obsessively about stuff that isn't a big problem, and in general feeling too shy or lazy to leave the house.  But with the ADD meds I feel like I can get up and do things, and can actually talk to people and hold real convos, and be more engaged in life instead of being ""stuck in my head"" 24/7.

I know that vyvanse is actually being trialed for schizophrenia, so it just makes me wonder what the big fear is about stimulants helping.  Honestly, caffeine seems more likely to cause racing thoughts or induce psychosis.  Although with a couple cups of coffee and a nicotine patch I can function almost to the same level as I do on amphetamines.

I just think the risks are a little overstated once you're pretty stable with other meds/treatment.  If you stimulant overdose then you can for sure get psychosis, but I don't think that happens unless you abuse your meds.  Plus that can happen just as easily with drinking too many energy drinks.

So I just feel like the stigma is a little unwarranted, but I'm not sure if that is just how my brain works though, seeing as I do have pretty bad ADD.  But I'd be surprised if my experiences are completely unique. 

What upsets me the most is that I feel like I function sooooo much better with the amphetamines, but because of my diagnosis the insurance doesn't want to cover it, which is ridiculous.  The insurance has no problem covering Lamictal, and that has a pretty high risk of dangerous rashes.  Yet nobody treats Lamictal as if it's going to for sure cause rashing and shy away from prescribing it when it can help people.  There are risks associated with all medications, but a particular risk factor shouldn't be treated as if it's inevitability. 

I just think there's a risk/reward to any kind of treatment.  For me, I don't take mega doses of antipsychotics, because the dose I do take gets rid of delusions and makes hallucinations less ""real"" so I can distinguish them from normal life.  To me that's what's important; I don't want to zombie out so I can kill all hallucinations, because hallucinations aren't that dangerous as long as I can tell that I'm tripping out or whatever and don't start having paranoia.  Yet, a lot of doctors want you to medicate to the point that all symptoms completely disappear (if that's even possible), which causes too many unwanted side effects for my liking.  Having some symptoms is not always worse than having side-effects, but many doctors seem to not really understand that.

I'm just glad that I stuck to my guns and took a hand in my own therapy, based on what I felt would work best for me.  I think if you're treatment isn't working as well as you'd like it's better to try to tweak things instead of just giving up.  

It might just be my brain, and the fact I also have ADHD, so I'm not necessarily recommending this to everyone.  I'm just pointing out that it helps me so it could help others, but YMMV.  

A friend of mine chose to switch from risperdal to zyprexa, and he is doing tons better than he was before.  If he hadn't thought to try another med then he would still be having problems.

**TL;DR - I don't know why there is this huge stigma against amphetamines for schizo when the risk can be well worth the reward.  Potential side effects don't stop docs from prescribing other types of medications (and pretty much every medication has potentially unwanted side effects).**","['dobj', 'pobj', 'pobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

My voices are calling me from another dimension. This is real. I feel like this whole 'verse isn't real now. Everyone's just pretending, it's important that they try to convince me I'm schizophrenic so I don't trust myself and I don't believe in the other dimension but it hasn't worked yet.

I feel like my mental health team - psychiatrist, case manager, therapist, and even friends and family are trying to convince me I'm psychotic but I'm not.

I'm a 21 yo male (currently in college) with a history of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, OCD, Panic Disorder, and Depression. I also have Temporal Lobe Epilepsy. The only medication I'm on is for seizures, although I have some benzos on hand for when I have a panic attack. 

Because my depression was getting so bad that I've had almost no motivation to do anything, I figured it was time to visit my pdoc to see if I could get something to help. I expected that he'd prescribe me some prozac or paxil or something and I'd be on my way, but he evidently thinks that I'm suffering from psychosis and recommended anti-psych meds, but I'm skeptical of this. 

Here are the symptoms of interest:

1)
I ""hear a voice"" in the sense that I ""hear"" my inner voice say mean things to me (""you're worthless,"" ""you don't deserve your friends,"" etc).  I know it's my voice and for the most part I have control over it, although sometimes if I'm having a bad day my thoughts are overwhelming and might I feel like I have no control over it, especially if I'm really tired and/or about to fall asleep.

2)
I don't really trust people (my friends/coworkers/companions). I've never been abused, but people have treated me pretty crappy in the past and I've seen many of the people I know talk about others behind their backs. I don't see why I should assume they won't do the same to me. I feel that if I trust people I'll be setting myself up to get taken advantage of. I mean, I want to trust people, but people can suck sometimes.

3)
One of the really big problems I face is that I get really *really* anxious when talking to my pdoc and so my ability to communicate effectively is impaired. Normally it's not to much of a problem, but lately I've also been so depressed that my ability to communicate has been further impaired. My anxiety causes me to be super worried of what my pdoc will think of me, but my depression has cut down my motivation to respond to him at all when he questions me. When I'm there talking to him, I just want to crawl into a hole and never come out. This creates a situation where I make no eye contact, I take forever to respond to his questions, and I repeat words over and over again while I'm trying to figure out what to say (For example: ""um...um...um...*awkward pause*...um...um... um...*another awkward pause*... *stare at ground until pdoc breaks silence*""). I'm concerned that this is or may appear as ""thought disorder"" rather than panic.

4)
I have been withdrawing socially and have lacked motivation, which as far as I'm aware are symptoms of both depression and psychosis.  

So basically, as far as my pdoc is concerned, I hear voices, don't trust my friends, and have trouble making eye contact and communicating. This is all in addition to loss of motivation and social withdrawal. I mean, it does seem like a description of psychosis.

At the same time, I feel he doesn't quite understand the nature or the nuances of my symptoms. I don't actually ""hear"" voices. I like my friends and coworkers, but I know they can be assholes. And omfg I get so damn nervous talking to my pdoc. I speak pretty fluently and coherently in most other situations, I think. He's even asked me if I have the same trouble speaking when I talk to other people, and I've said ""no,"" but to be honest, I'm not certain that he believes me. 

My pdoc seems super confident that I need anti-psych meds and that I will decompensate without them. He told me that I could get a second opinion but that he is certain they will just tell me the same thing he's told me. And he acts surprised when I say that I've had no trouble at work (I've worked at the same place for the past 5 years and my job involves a lot of people skills) and that my friends and parents have aren't worried about me at all (when I bring something up with them, like ""I'm worried about I'll get a psychotic episode because people with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy are more prone to it,"" they just tell me I'm worrying too much and that I'm totally sane). 

Anyway, since this meeting with my pdoc, I've gotten a lot of my motivation back because I'm so pissed at his confidence in the idea that I'm completely dysfunctional that I want to prove him wrong just so that he could see his ""psychosis"" theory blow up in his face. I mean, he'll never admit that he's wrong, he'll probably just claim that I was briefly psychotic and spontaneously went into remission, but it would still make me so happy to prove him wrong. 

Personally, I think it's very unlikely that I'm actually suffering from psychosis. My friends even laugh at the idea when I bring it up. But my doctor is a trained professional and he's confident about his diagnosis. I also know that it is common for people with psychosis to not be aware that they are experiencing the symptoms of psychosis. So I get that I could be wrong. I already have epilepsy, so I know that my brain is not normal. I've decided I don't want to go on meds (why would I if I don't trust his diagnosis?). To be honest, my desire to prove my pdoc wrong has more or less pushed me out of my depressive state (my anxiety levels are still through the roof though).

Sorry for the super long post, I really needed to get this off my chest. Does anyone on this sub have some advice? Do you think I should listen to my doctor? Does what I was experiencing sound anything like psychosis?

**TL;DR**

My pdoc thinks I'm psychotic and need anti-psych meds. I and my family and friends disagree. I'm functioning pretty well at the moment, but I'm not sure that I should completely dismiss my pdoc's professional opinion. I am hoping that r/schizophrenia has some wisdom to impart to me.

i dont mind her changing his mind from week to week about what she wants to do with her life but when her actions affect others i do. maybe i just don't know how to let go. excample. she calls/texts to say lets meet up. then calls back the next day sayign she forgot. says lets meet up in a couple hours. couple hours later instead of showing up she says to say she changed my mind. half the time i have to call to find out why she hasnt showed up. i tell her that she shouldnt waste other peoples time and each time its as if i am telling her this for the first time. i got annoyed a few times recently after more than 5+ times in a couple months and she took offense and wanted to end our friendship. she would call back a couple days later but would not take accuontablitly but did sound like she new she was in the wrong. somehow she still needs to have the last word. she just blames it on her condition.

is all this really happening because of her condition? am i just enabling her - that she can still have friends even if shes a bad friend? im the last friend she has left from childhood. we are both 30+. do i just need to learn how to let go and move on?

i understand why she wants friends - its lonely and being social is a key part of life. will she ever understand how to be a good friend? She says her meds have subsided the voices and rarely hears them now for the past 5 months.

I was in a two year relationship, I had no my own apartment, I had a job, I had a car, I had friends. I lost everything because I wasn't well. My boyfriend couldn't take watching me go through my paranoid episodes, ripping up the carpet to find something that wasn't there, constantly talking about my phone and my computer being hacked, blaming him for being in on some conspiracy against me. I can't blame him for leaving. It was the best for his own well being. We've almost been broken up for 2 years now, and I've lived at home with my parents for around the same time. My thinking is now so disorganized, and the overstimulation is so intense when trying to social interact, there's just no way I can have an extended conversation with someone. I'm 26 now, and I have one friend left. We've been friends since we were 4, but I still don't hang out with him because it's too hard for me. He invited me out tonight, and I declined. I wanted to go, but at the same time I didn't. I had to take a medical leave from school because I started having a paranoid episode while there. I'm smart. I have like 7 certifications: 4 from FEMA, 2 from NCTSN, and one from AHA. I'm in the Medical Reserve Corps, and I have only ever participated in one event in the past year because I just can't bring myself to leave when the time comes. It terrifies me. It doesn't constantly bother me because I tend to have enough going on in my head to keep me busy in my room all day. But sometimes I get lonely. I don't have anyone to hold me at night, anyone I feel comfortable enough to be around like that. It gives me the fear, that I will grow old alone. And sometimes I'm okay with that idea, and other times I'm not. The meds help with the psychosis, but there's so many aspects of my life they don't help with.

When I was 14 I was diagnosed schizoaffective, I spent most my teen years on risperdal and seroquel. The medication turned me into an emotionless zombie and I refused to take it anymore. I have been off meds since I was 18 and for the most part I have been highly functional. My pyschosis is pretty consistent but I have been able to tune it out for the most part.

My drug use is picking up and I find I am doing them now more so to distract myself from the isolation I feel. 

My dad was a meth head and has the same diagnosis, he is completely incoherent now. I am very afraid I will one day end up all alone and desire nothing but a distraction just like him.

Even when I'm with friends or family I still feel isolated. They will never understand why I'm always in my head, or why I'm always so distant, or why I'm so afraid of everything.

In turning this from an abstract pattern of neuronal signalling into concrete words, even if just stored on by magnetizing of a small section on a rotating platter will help how I am feeling right now. 

From the outside looking in, it would seem that I am doing much better than I was at diagnosis. That I am a model of recovery. 

Five, almost six years ago I was diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and began psychiatric medication. I lost passion, interest and desire around the same time. It is hard to describe what this means to someone that hasn’t experienced it. I think those that have experienced depression might be able to empathize somewhat, but because everyone’s experience of reality is different it is hard to explain. A little background on myself. 

Prior to the age of 25, I had passion. Sex might be the easiest to start with. I had things that “got me sprung”. I could (when appropriate)  leer at a woman, feeling a desire that was hard to control. It was difficult to look away. The phrase “drooling over” might even be applicable. I had appetites outside of the cultural norm as well, although nothing interesting and certainly not anything illegal. There was this intense desire to indulge in sex, to have an orgasm. Nothing was or could have been a better experience. I was passionate about it. 

I was passionate about my emotional relationships with other people. There was nothing I wanted more than to spend times with my family, my ex-wife, and my many friends. Each conversation, where I grew to know someone just a little better was an incredible experience for me. Emotionally, when I was happy, I felt happy. When I was excited about something, I felt that excitement. Being around people, having conversations was extremely rewarding. Spending time with my spouse laying in bed, touching and being touched was a sensual experience I loved. Hugging my mother was deeply comforting and would cause my worry, stress and fear to disappear. A hug from a family member would cause my back to relax, and send an emotional warmth through me. 


I was passionate about finishing things that I started. Achieving short and long term goals gave a sense of satisfaction, and I was passionate about my interests. In high school, I did every extracurricular I could fit in. It wasn’t for the purpose of getting into a good college, it was because I enjoyed them. I enjoyed the experiences they gave me. I was passionate about my study area in school, graduating with a 3.8 GPA and highest honors. I loved to master new skills, even if they had limited value to me. Short term things were great too. Reading a good book, I would read it cover to cover as soon as I could. If a video game sounded good I would play it until it was unenjoyable. Movies were an amazing experience. Successfully planning a party, all of it was rewarding, and I felt passionate about getting that reward. 

Imagine if those things disappeared from your world one day. Imagine a man in a white coat telling you that you weren’t depressed, that you had something called “negative symptoms”. That they were a part of an “illness” that no test existed for. That the medication you started taking that coincided with the onset of lacking passion was supposed to help, even if just a little bit. But you accept it, because men in white coats are experts - and besides everyone agrees with them.

If there was one thing that the medicine did do, it was to make me apathetic. I simply did not care about being on disability, I did not care that I no longer had goals. I didn’t care that my relationship with my ex-wife was deteriorating. The relationship ended when I began experiencing severe insomnia. I am no longer even sure it was “real” insomnia, or “paradoxical” insomnia. I had no libido, felt like shit from the insomnia and as a result cared jack shit about sex. I attributed, whether correctly or incorrectly the insomnia to the medication and I cut my dose significantly, even switching medications. 

The less I took, the less apathetic I became. I started caring, but I did not start experience positive emotions. What I felt were sadness and anger. Maybe a better phrase to use instead of passion would have been positive feelings. 

I dug into psychiatric and psychological research from the past fifty years regarding psychotic disorders and schizophrenia. I discovered something disconcerting. There are almost no studies that followed patients that had refused medication long term. There are no imaging studies whatsoever that tracked what happened in the brains of unmedicated schizophrenics. Animal studies eventually indicated that the loss in volume previously attributed to schizophrenia might very well be caused by medication. A long term study showed that volume loss correlated with antipsychotic dose, and a shorter term study found that patients randomized on to haldol and zyprexa both experienced volume loss, but the patients on haldol lost 50% more volume than zyprexa. This was not attributable to symptoms as the patients had been randomized.

Given these findings I am suspicious about things we know about schizophrenia from psychometrics. Knowing that the medication causes very noticeable changes in several areas of the brain, how do you whether to attribute changes in cognitiion to the illness or to a “side effect” of the medication?

Put another way, to a lay person it seems like most of what we know about schizophrenia may have been confounded by the medication. Psychiatrists don’t seem keen to talk about this. The ones that do acknowledge it tend to deny it. The papers still being published about the “neuro-protective” nature of the medication have interesting things in the disclosures section. Searching the sunshine database show some of the authors receiving $300,000+ speaking for pharmaceutical companies in 2013. 

This led me to decide to quit taking antipsychotics all together. The apathy has vanished, but I realized that there was more holding me back than that. I have been off for three months. My passion has not returned, so I do not know which of the following is true:

It was a side effect of the medication, and if given more time will return.
It is permanent damage from the medication, and will not return.
It is an aspect of the illness that there are currently no treatments even on the horizen for.

The first one is where I have my hope pegged. I am giving it another four months before I give up on it entirely. The second two I avoid thinking about at this point. When my mind wonders to them, I despair. The reason for the despair is twofold. 

My emotional experience was the glue that integrated my thoughts and my senses. Without them, I feel like I am split. I have senses. I experience touch, sight, smell, and taste. When I experience them, I think about them. I do not experience positive emotion very strongly, or sometimes not at all. I relish my fiance’s touch, though it just makes me feel slightly above baseline. I do not play video games, I do not read. I do not learn. I flit from website to website almost all day every day. I do nothing, because nothing seems particularly worth doing. 

We sense, we feel, and we think. It seems that all three are required to have a fulfilling life. Instead, I paint my life by numbers. I run through a checklist of about twenty things in the morning, I run through a checklist at noon, I run through a dinner checklist when I cook, and I run through a checklist at bedtime. I schedule exercise and socializing. I plan dates with my fiance. It is a life, but it is a horribly unfulfilling life to live by a checklist. Without the checklist I haphazardly do things throughout the day, which is even worse as it is a life utterly without purpose. 

I turned to research to find an answer that I realize I will not find there. Time will tell my if my first hypothesis is true - it will come back. I can only wait so long until I realize that the second two are likely correct. There isn’t much of a difference between the two in reality. I would be utterly without hope that my experience of life will ever be as it was. That I will ever again experience passion as I described it. That I will have to live my life literally checking off one day at a time on the calendar. It makes me wonder if I would lose my will to live. The medication simply made me not care, but knowing that it would not get better would cause me to not want to deal with the terrible side effects the drugs have to be worth having that apathy. 

I have no answers, and my hourglass full of hope is running low. I fear now that I will give in to despair and lose the will to keep trying.

I can't hear them anymore, meds are functioning properly to rid me of the suffering, screaming, whispering voices. If they work against them then the only logical conclusion is I have a disease that needs treatment, since treatment works, I have that disease.

But my mind jumps to any other theory besides the one everyone would have me believe. Is this paranoia?

I go straight to thinking, ""of course the medication is working, it's not meds for schizophrenia, that's what they'd have me believe, but it's really to block my inter-dimentional listening abilities."" 

""of course they tell me I'm schizophrenic, they're protecting the demons in the other dimension I have to kill. They're all against me. They give me this drug and have people watch me on the bus and everywhere I go to ensure I do not harm myself because then I'd go to the other dimension and save the people they don't want saved.""

I think these conspiracies in my head over and over and over and they always *feel* more likely than what everyone would have me believe about my ""schizophrenia"" 

Of course I'm ""schizophrenic"", if I weren't they'd have to admit there's so much more to the 'verse than simple people see. 

But I'll stay here. I'll pretend with them. I *know* they *know* I'm the Godess of the other dimension. They know. I know. We're all just playing games to get through the day but one day I'm going to be ready to play my true part in the 'verse. 

Starting Clozapine Monday. It's supposed to be very effective for my ""schizophrenia"" so I'll take it.. I believe in the voices. They're stronger than they know. They can fight until I die of natural causes. I know they can do without me for a while, so no rush to kill myself to get there. 

If I'm right I have to kill myself. Anytime yesterday would be good. 

It's always urgent to do so. 

Scared I'm wrong, too. The folk in the other dimension.. my brain has created extra voices for all my suffering. Maybe that's the reality. 

How do you handle feeling like reality is just a conspiracy against you? I told some mental health workers the other day that I knew everyone was just pretending I'm a schizophrenic person and not a God. They didn't say anything. 

I don't know what to believe. I don't. I'm stuck. 

I'm so sure but the people in my life cast shadows of doubt, of strong worry. 

My greatest fear is that I'll never be independent because of this illness. I know I'm schizophrenic in that I know that is my diagnosis but do not 100% agree that my experiences are because of it.

It is my absolute nightmare to have to be taken care of by others because I'm too sick to take care of myself. 

I want my own apartment, with a stable job, and a cat. That is my ultimate life goal. Once I get that then I'm free to just do things that make me happy. I want that. 

My ""delusions"" crush that dream, the dream I've had since I was a kid, to be away from dependencies of harmful people. 

If the voices are right then I must kill myself for them at some point in my life. 

I'm so confused. 

I'm on Zyprexa right now and the voices are gone. Clearer mind when they're not pushing me to put a bullet in my brain-pan. 

So I don't know what I agree with. 

I agree I am diagnosed with schizophrenia. 
I agree my beliefs seem outrageous to some. 
I agree I hear and see things others don't. 

I  don't know where I'm going with this.. 

Just wish I could scream and scream and scream until I go back in time to before I had schizophrenia. To the time when I'd agree with everyone in that I knew killing myself was wrong. 

Now all I think is that it's a must. That urgent action must be accomplished to save another dimension of people that pray to me as their Goddess. 

Me at 20 would have told me that there would never be a good reason to do that. Me at 20 would have talked me down and risked everything in the 'verse to make me feel safe again. 

Now I'm 23. And I'm lost. The confusion never stops. I need something to ""reset"" me in a way. Bring me back to pre-schizophrenia. Is that possible?

I watched my girlfriend (we'll call her Jill) go from seemingly completely healthy, to displaying many schizophrenic symptoms including auditory hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thoughts, working memory issues, and other odd behavior.  She was admitted to a very reputable mental health clinic several weeks ago under her own will. She was at her worst a day after arrival. She couldn't hold a cohesive thought for more than a ten seconds, and she was unaware of where she was or what day it was. After only one WEEK of treatment she responded very well. Jill was lucid, and totally aware of her surroundings. It was the first time I saw a glimpse of her true personality return. She was finally released three weeks after her arrival, with the assumption she will continue treatment as an outpatient. Last night was the first night we spent together in over a month and I am very happy with her improvements. She is on three different drugs that seem to be working. She is showing some symptoms like slight loss of facial expression and poor posture.  However, the original major issues are not present. I have attended several family therapy sessions, and the doctors seemed very confident in her road to recovery given her lack of history and acceptance of her illness.  They explicitly told me she cannot have her medication removed until she is evaluated in the future. 

Now this brings me to the issues with her asshole mother (We'll call her Mary). Throughout the entire process Mary was complaining about the clinic, their treatment strategy, the drugs, and me. She has blamed Jill's illness on me several times, because ""I stressed her out"" and ""I am an arrogant agnostic"". Now that Jill is out of the clinic Mary wants to make her stop the meds, and do a water only fasting. She thinks Jesus Christ is her only hope, and doesn't trust the medical professionals.  Luckily, Jill has been ignoring her Mother's orders, and her father is on the side of the doctors and me.

I have no experience with metal illness, but I am trying to learn more. I love her with all my heart, and I am doing all I can to support her recovery.  I am writing this in hopes of receiving any advice people may have. If you suffer from schizophrenia, or are indirectly effected like me, please feel free to comment.

I haven't presented the entirety to anyone, at least like this before and communication is difficult for me. It's not all here. There's more, but I don't like it.

Let me show you some slivers. I sleep a lot. I can't stay awake. Focus is impossible for me, but sometimes it's all I can do. My speech patterns are irregular. I used to believe I used to be articulate, but I can't tell anymore. Thoughts are incoherent at best, stampeding at worst.  But these are lifelong problems. 

I started seeing and hearing things in middle school. But they didn't interfere with my life much, I instead thought it was more or less a superpower. It was like a jungle gym for the mind. So interesting. But I didn't focus on them at all. I couldn't yet. 

I liked to play with emotions. My own, not other people. Catharsis was more desirable than love or hate. But I liked them all. I felt them with such depth that they felt like i was different people. But now I don't have any of them. Except for the nausea. I don't respond to events or situations correctly. My reactions obtuse, I am terminally chill. Wikipedia calls it flat affect. I'm kind of glad others know about it. But they really don't know the nausea. 

I always feel like an outsider when I get the nausea. It hurts. I can't relate to people even though I'm speaking at them or with them. Sometimes social anxiety causes me to awkwardly excuse myself just because I can't take it. The nausea or the people.  But sometimes I appear to connect. But I'm really not. I wish I was, at least the one who is in control now. 

I used to study philosophy, it eased me in middle school through my half assed attempt through college. But now it only makes me more solipsistic or antisocial. I can't do it anymore. I wish I had the willpower for school again. 

I have a job, I serve food. I have to go to it in 2 hours. I don't know how to act there. I do my work, but my coworkers do not really talk to me. And I wish I could, but I don't know how. My other job was so much more warm. But it paid less. Is money really important?

I scared myself yesterday. I was making food with a friend. While we were talking I idling saw the knife I cut up apples with and reached for it and gripped it, kinda fast. It wasn't until the knife was moving back towards me that I realized my mind had an intention on using it on my friend. I quickly stopped it and acted like I was just playing with it. He didn't notice. But I did. I'm shaking and crying thinking about that. 

Imagine having event hiccups where unpredictable plops of action happen. Record scratching is daily life. I love music. 

I've been diagnosed with various mental disorders. ADD, depression, GAD, schizophrenia, anorexia, bipolar disorder, are what I remember seeing a lot. I like pot because it reminds me to eat. But it hurts what little motivation I have sometimes. 

I am seeking medical professional help. But the medication makes me sleepy. It just makes my mental landscape even more weird. My delusions involve me being Christopher Columbus. Or a sailor.  Unexplored territory I guess. 

I have friends and a family that support me. I think. But I can't feel them. Numb. But I'm a good faker. So I can't even tell the different between true gratitude or not. The same goes with many. And yet I've always been called perceptive. I could be an actor. I used to want that. 

I don't know what I'm asking. I've already forgotten. I just want to know how to live. How to make friends. How to actually be what I think I sometimes appear to others to be. How to be better. Because im not. Am I wasting my time again. This is too much wall of text to delete, I might as well post. ",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I go by byron.  That's my psuedonym.  

I have schizophrenia, Tourette's, and other problems.  

I live in Michigan, outside of Detroit.  
I used to be a chemsit for a few different companies, but I kept leaving after finding out all their corruption.  I work as a pantry cook now at a Pei Wei Asian Diner and don't make enough to survive.  I also spend a lot of time volunteering in Detroit.  

The last company I left on good terms with was in late February 2015 and it was AkzoNobel (as in, the company that founded the Nobel Prizes, which is quite ironic for what I am about to whistle blow here).  AkzoNobel would waste a whole lot of paint.  A warehouse full of binders, paints, and solvents each and every year to be honest.  The paint was still good, really, and could often have been used at collision shops.  But, due to the strict quality control of our own research, the dent in sales if we were to sell the discounted paint to American collision shops, and the lack of potential sales of our lower-end, shittier quality paint brands we make for developing nations; all of that there warehouse paint had to be dumped, incinerated, or shipped to another place to be somebody else's problem.  The chemicals in the paint were not safe either.  I am talking heavy metals and carcinogenic solvents if touched or inhaled.  
These are all ""allegations,"" of course, because how in the world could my allegations be true?  Hmm?  I think I signed some confidentiality agreeements too.  That's pretty funny.  Can I play in their game now too?  It seems I've got not much to lose, and a whole lot to gain.  

I used to work with DuPont/Axalta as well, and know they were up to the same games.  I had an office job there though, and was treated as a second-class citizen for being a contractor instead of a salary employee.  Good thing I went to college.  I certainly wouldn't be surprised if PPG, BASF, and Sherwin Williams were, and are, playing these games too.

Don’t even get me started with Dow in Midland, MI.  That place is fucked.  

I cannot ethically work for any of those companies.

In early March 2015, I went to the Department of Human Services, and applied for food stamps and insurance.  I have stated I have mental issues and need medication urgently.  

I have applied and have been rejected three times now.  This is over the course of months too.  The case managersssss (I've had three now, you'd think one of them could help me) do nothing that I can see.  Their voicemail boxes are full,  I make vain, ignored phone calls, they have not always responded to my emails, and I have waited for four hours at the DHS office to meet with one of them.  

I have been without medication (citalopram and Abilify) for over three weeks now.  I am having zap sensations on the top of my head, which causes me to be offbalance for about half a second.  My Tourette's tics are flaring up.  My face has subtle, uncontrollable twitches.  I am hearing shit that isn't there.  I am seeing lights and shadows that are not there.  I believe I could have heart arythmia like I had when I was undiagnosed with my mental illnesses.  I am depressed, angry, and disgruntled.  I don't even fuck with me because I've given myself a black, right eye.  This shit is real.  I put up mean fights if dragged too long.  If you're going to forcefeed me shit, I will spit it in your face.  

I am fed up with the United States Government.  

If you'd ask around the people I know, they'd say I am a good guy.  I am usually polite and nice.  After nine years of Catholic school, I even earned the Bishiop's Award in 8th grade for being the most ideological Christian.  I am not going to be nice now though, not anymore.  

I have been contacting friends and telling them what's going on.  They've been putting me in contact with certain people that should speed this process along.  But, I have no fucking expectations at this point.  

I went to the DHS office again this morning telling them I need medication  now.  They said it will be 7 to 10 business days before I would even get heard from a judge or whoever the fuck I am supposed to see.  

I warned them at the DHS office this morning that I am a chemsit, and that the voices in my head may or may not be telling me to make MDMA to fuck up the surbubanites.  I told them I can make shit happen if I don't see shit happen.  The morbidly obese Asian lady worker behind the plexiglass window at the DHS (who has always had an attitude during my previous Mr. Nice Guy visits) decided to actually use her microphone for once so that I could clearly hear her sarcastically say ""Have a good day!"" as I was leaving.   

I said ""Yeah, FUCK YOU TOO"" as I strolled passed the security at the front.  

I decided to drive by the Jaguar, Cadillac, Aston Martin, and Lamborghini dealerships on the way back to my place off 15 mile.  
I was just browsing really.  Ya know?  Just a good, innocent browse.  

Did you know that the houses north of the white segregated 8 mile go for several thousand dollars?  Like, $75,000 to a million depending on what you're looking for.  

Did you know my friends south of the black segregated 8 mile (right off 7 mile) bought their two story house, with basement, and the property for $500?

That was after 60 hours of phone calls to finally get their house and land.  

I am talking millionaires and welfare recipients all within a 5 to 10 mile radius.  

We've done neighborhood cleanups last spring.  There was a lot of construction debris dumped illegally by suburban contractors so they could avoid proper disposal costs.  There were also a lot of ""weed balls"" in black trash bags in which hood motherfuckers illegally, illegally dumped marijuana clippings and soil (which happens to work great for compost, so no complaints there, really.)

I am pantheist myself, but we certainly do not live in a Christian nation.  Stephen Colbert and Ghandi have some good quotes on that one.  People, yourself included, need to wake the fuck up.  Do the change you want to see.  

I cannot explain enough the good shit I, and many others, are doing throughout Detroit.  Detroit is truly, at this stage, the wild, wild west.  

Remember, Detroit is in The United States of America.  The houses I visit have no running water, electricity, and need to use wood-burning stoves in the winter.  I shit you not, it's the same shit I saw in the houses I visited in Russia.

I am an artist too.  If you're curious to see my webcomics, please check out

TL;DR

As far as the symptoms go, I feel like I have many. My only beef is, I don't know if these could be caused by the depression, or if they could be schizophrenia. The medication I'm taking for depression hasn't lessened the symptoms I'm about to list here. 

Symptoms include:
-Believing that books and pictures can read my mind
-Feeling a presence directly behind me, even when I'm alone
-Sudden withdrawl from life (from friends and activities I like)
-Flat facial expressions
-Having troubles concentrating
-Sometimes feeling like I,can't turn my brain off because there's almost like a static constantly running
-The last thing I heard or read repeating in my head multiple times
-sudden, general clumsiness
-Used to believe that I was ""the chosen one"" to defeat all evil in the world and that a goddess would take me to another world when it was time for me to begin my adventure
-I have troubles taking care of everyday things like working and cleaning
-Forget what I'm going to say or do often
-Easily overwhelmed by lots of detail and lots of people being around
-Very strange and disturbing nightmares every night
-Used to feel fingers running up and down my back, though this has subsided now
-Used to have a voice that would narrate everything I did (ex. after I said a sentence ""she said, as she closes the book."")

Upon my birth, my mother developed what I've been told as Schizophrenia. She was once a slim, slender, gorgeous and almost model-like. Since then, she has put on a considerable amount of weight, became very depressed and started taking medication to battle her problems. She struggles with hearing voices, most of which are bad or harmful. They speak of rape, killing and other harmful things most of the time. She yells and shouts at them and screams at the top of her lungs to leave her alone and to go away but sometimes they can even be humouras and funny as she tends to laugh at nothing when she is alone.

My mother is non responsive and is usually lost in her own world. She doesn't respond to the call of her name or to someone trying to get her attention, it usually takes a couple of attempts to get her to pay attention. She sometimes becomes paranoid saying people are trying to harm her, my father is cheating on her and several other things. 

When she would take her medication, mainly Zyprexa(sp?) she would be just fine and return to normal, engaging in conversations, cleaning the house and taking care of things, however, lately her medication hasn't been working and she just wanders around the house, looking for something to do. She doesn't enjoy playing games, watching TV, talking to people or anything for that matter. She just wanders back and forth as if she's looking for something and when asked what she is looking for, she just replies ""I'm bored."" but she refuses to entertain herself. The only thing that she seems to enjoy is smoking cigarettes, something she's been doing as long as I've been alive. She doesn't enjoy being at home and she sometimes wanders off outside, walking the streets or just standing at corners. She constantly speaks of running away to different places and asks for money to do so. She's even gone as far as stealing money from me and my brothers to buy cigarettes and to take off to god knows where.

I feel like no one cares about me, I'm completely disorganiezd, I feel like even the closest people to me don't care about me and even though they do, I can't believe them. I can't believe anyone, I think my girlfriend is constantly cheating on me, even if she says she doesn't constantly and her friends that are with her say she doesn't, I don't believe them and just get even worse. My future feels over, I can't do my exams still I'm in college,  while everyone else is doing them now, I'm a complete and utter failure. I have a fuzzy over my thoughts, it just feels so fuzzy, It feels like something is just holding them back, and threatening them if they leave my brain and speak and I'm not sure why. I feel so lonely, really lonely, I never felt it this bad before the meds well, I actually liked being lonely before. Anyway, my speech is just all over the place, no one cares about me and even if they did I can't even tell them truly how I think or feel because, I can't. There's no point in living if I'm trapped in my own mind.
I'm clumsy, I'm all over the place, I'm a loner, I'm eccentric at times which people find as ""weird"" I guess. I'm not the normal 15 (16 year old in a few months) old. I see my psychiatrist tomorrow, I guess I can tell her some of this also. I think the meds are making me agitated and restless and ugh, just, worse? Is this possible with Abilify? Shall I ask for a different one just yet? I'm really inpatient I know.
I know I post here a lot and its probably annoying but I have no one else to talk to but I'm also sorry for being annoying. I still hear voices I guess, would you count hearing an alien, type, intrusive voice in your head *ONLY IN YOUR HEAD BTW* a voice? I'm not sure, I'm still learning about my illness. I just feel so alone, I can't think straight and I feel trapped in my own mind, I don't have the same opportunities as most people my age and Its making me angry and sad, maybe a little depressed. *I'm sorry*.

I took down all of the posts visibility to burn my cringey digital corpse, but I guess there is one more thing before the grand finale final conclusion. 

I've had ideas that Schizophrenia was a possibility for me, I pursued a psychiatrist, blah blah blah. I'm on medication now, going on day three of it. Results are only improving. Here's what gets me, he's dodging the subject of diagnosis and has got me on particular meds. Risperidone. It makes my constant auditory hallucinations go away, as well as all general psychosis. Fluoxetine is my other med, it's pretty general and simple though. It's been months, and he won't talk about it. The exact description in the warning packet for Risperidone states ""This medicine is an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder"" it also says a doctor may give you it for other reasons though.

Also, I brought it up and he said Schizophrenia was definitely an option for a diagnosis. No other statement one way or another any where else. Standard (from what I skimmed on here) medication for people with Schizophrenia. It looks like I have a reasonable argument for it being a possibility. 

I have several friends who are diagnosed depressed, or have talked to psychiatrists. They all got the process done semi quick. Schizophrenia in particular takes 6 months to diagnose to my understanding. I don't know man. 

I think my Risperidone is kicking in, I'm getting a little drowsy. It does it's job, but it sure makes me tired. Haha. Makes everything feel ""meh"" though, neutral on everything. I think it's worth it though. This is the first time I can remember not hearing stuff, except for one time when I was drunk. (Relax, I only drank once a month or so ago, I'm at the age where most people try it anyways, I'm 16 by the way)

he doesnt trust any of us in the family, he thinks we put a chip in his head and that we are all out to get him. he blames his job situation on us as well and claims that we ""fucked him over"". these are intigrated into his head now and they constatly come up in conversation. he hates us all and refuses to get help because the last time my father took him to get medication he came back thinking that the doctors ""planted more chips"" in his body. he now refuses to get help of any sort. he needs new meds, or help or something. the one time we actually managed to get him to the hospital the doctors said that he was perfectly fine and that the meds should be working, he was sent home with no changes and the behaviour continued to this day. 

what can we even do about this? how can we get him to the hospital or get him help with financing if hes not willing to cooperate? everyone tells my father that ""he is over 18 now"" so you cant sign him up without his consent. this feels like a never ending battle with a dillusional person that will drive my family into the streets if he continues to act this way.

I was against it because oral risperdone didn't work for him a few years back.  It seemed to work well for a couple of weeks, and then all hell broke loose.  He started becoming delusional again, and hearing voices, though I didn't figure out that the voices were back until much too late.

About a month ago, he joined several hookup websites and started hitting on dozens of women online.  Our relationship had so far seemed solid, no major problems I was aware of, so this really seemed incomprehensible to me.  When I confronted him about it a few days ago, the voices in his head just sort of....took over.  He had a total psychotic breakdown and I was forced to call 911.

I went to see him in the hospital the next day, and he was still a bit delusional, but very cheerful, and very inappropriately forward with me in full view of the hospital staff.  Groping me, flashing his junk from his hospital gown every time he sat down, trying to convince me of all the different places we could have sex in the hospital.

They moved him to another facility, and I've been told that no meds seem to be working on him at this point- that he's agitated and ""very heavily sexually preoccupied"".

This has never happened before, in the eight years I've known him.  It's totally bizarre.  When I expressed my concern that he was having symptoms despite his medication, and that I thought Invega was causing problems, his psychiatrist insisted that he just needed time to adjust to it, and if I was concerned, he would prescribe oral Invega as a supplemental medication.  We'll be switching his psychiatrist by the end of the month, but I'm desperate for answers *now*.

Has anyone else had this problem with Invega Sustenna?  I need to figure out if it's the injection causing this sexual obsession, or if it's just a new facet of his illness that we haven't seen yet.","['pobj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

My friend has paranoid schizophrenia and they are struggling right now. It's gotten to the point where they pretty much rely on me for everything, emotional support etc. They have other friends who they turn to when they're really low emotionally but it seems that I give my friend the most support so I often have to comfort them when they're really unstable.

Because of this, my friend tends to perceive everything I do or say that suggests that I'm annoyed to be a slight against them. Sometimes, when I'm feeling low myself, I don't want to talk, I want to be left alone. If I say as such, I feel like a jerk because it upsets them and makes them think that I don't like them/don't feel comfortable around them.This then inevitably turns into a big discussion where I am constantly having to reassure them. 

Their parent seems to be negligent or unsupportive (pushes them to do things that they are not ready to do) from what they've told me and their home life in general seems to be atrocious and is overall even more of a detriment to their mental health. So they have no support system at home and pretty much rely entirely on me.

I have anxiety and depression issues that mandate me needing a therapist and this person unfortunately makes my own problems worse to the point where even my relatives have noticed that I'm more on edge than usual. I do not want to stop being their friend because I do care about them and they have been there for me during extremely difficult times. I am frightened that if our friendship were to end, or if I were to be away for an extended period of time, they would end up taking their own life as they have alluded to my friendship being the only thing stopping them from doing so. They have been urging myself and their other friends to remove them. I now know that they've done this because they plan to kill themselves once they no longer have anyone.

They are socially withdrawn, even from their family and have indicated that they cannot function normally irl. They apparently cannot get any more medicine because their psychiatrist is not around and only they can prescribe them more. So they are unmedicated right now and incredibly unstable.

I have looked up NICE guidelines online and it says that they should've been assigned a mental health team. When I ask them if it's possible to contact someone from the team, I'm told that no they cannot. I do not understand how this is possible, nor do I understand how they have run out of their anti-psychotic medicine. We live in the same country and healthcare/medication is free here.

My friend is having suicidal thoughts right now. I have advised them to call Samaritans, they did so last night when they were having an attack. Apparently, they did not find this useful at all. As they are a minor, I have now encouraged them to contact Childline where I'm hoping someone will be able to be more sympathetic.

I don't want to bring this up to my boyfriend because he's having problems, himself, and I really want to be as supportive as possible to him until he's able to figure out what's going on with his work.

I don't really have anyone to talk to about this stuff, so I guess I'm just ranting... If anyone has any advice on how to calm yourself down or possibly make the hallucinations slow down a bit... That would be a real big help.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

I go to bed, and begin hearing all sorts of nightmarish voices and screams and pleas for help by which I'd have to hurt myself to help them.

I don't know if the meds can cause this, but it happens every night without fail after taking 'em. I'm stuck paralyzed listening to screams until I disappear from the medication.

It's not so much scary, I miss them when I'm awake. Because I feel like what they have to say is important, but it's very unsettling to feel like you can't move with scared screams all around you. I asked my doctor if the medication can cause hallucinations and he said no.

So I guess this is just the illness taking form.

It isn't anywhere like that during the day, it only happens when I'm tired. I used to hear voices 24/7 nearly nonstop, but I guess the medication is being effective at this point.

Anyone else swamped with voices as they try to sleep? I mean I don't mind voices... but I wish I could remember what they said when I wakeup, but it's all blurry.

Also, anyone have success with Clozapine? I'm gonna start on a low dose of that next week in addition to seroquil and welbutrin and anxiety meds.","['conj', 'nsubj']",1,neu_vader

Since then I've had about 3 or 4 more drug induced episodes (stupid, I know. I'm currently in a sober living home and working the NA program.)

Most psychiatrists I spoke with wrote it off as drugs and nothing more, but I was skeptical due to the sudden onset (as opposed to those who experience hallucinations because of lack of sleep or years and years of use.). Finally after about 5 psychotic experiences during stone cold sobriety I found a doctor who agreed with my suspicions and put me on antipsychotics.

I was wondering if anyone else has experience with mental illness as a result of drug abuse. Assuming I stay sober and use my meds as recommended, will I eventually get better and not need the pills anymore? Or is it possible to say? I really hate how the meds make me feel and would like to be off them ASAP, but I'm told I'll need at least 6 months with no symptoms before titration is considered.

I'm currently at 2.5 mg of Zyprexa, but I took 5 mg last night and I feel a little better today.

The other day I noticed I wasn't feeling normal. I started feeling more paranoid, colors seemed brighter, and I'm unsure of what I'm hearing is actually real, like hearing intelligible chatter over the PA at work. Yesterday I saw a fly in the milk cooler where I work (Kroger) and it looked like it disappeared into thin air. I've tried taking Abilify before.. but it made me feel way to anxious and paranoid.. Like I wanted to just hide in a closet.

I'm not feeling depressed at the moment, which is odd for me given my diagnosis. Has anyone here had their medication stop working? Maybe I should stay at 5 mg. My nurse practitioner told me I could if I started feeling odd again.",['nsubj'],1,neu_vader

That is a pretty kind way of saying his psychosis was so bad he wandered the city knocking on doors and peering in windows and trying to talk to people - one person beat him up - it was a bad deal. I took him to the emergency room where he was admitted and held for 72 hours of a 96 hour hold.  

During his stay, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Previously, we thought he had high-functioning autism but yeah, it is schizophrenia, the symptoms all align. 

Since that time, he has sort of stablized, is taking meds, has a part time job, etc. He fights every day. I am so proud of this kid - while at the same time just trying to hold shit together.

In the hospital, while still very psychotic, he told the doctors that he had a makeshift home-based drug lab (he didn't but he DID watch a bunch of Breaking Bad episodes) and pretty much made it sound like he was just high on drugs (rather than telling them that he was being initiated by the illuminati - a very fixed delusion he told me about upon his discharge). It bears mentioning that he tested negative for all drugs except marijuana. I tried to talk to the doctors but they told me I needed to get real about his drug use and get connected to a support group. 

Now, months later, a doctor that has never met my son - but is employed by the insurance company - is stating they will not cover his hospital stay because my son was not a danger to himself or others. 

(These are the same insurance company assclowns that literally suggested I take him to a homeless shelter when I called their nurse line requesting outpatient care referrals.)

I do not know what to do. I am a single mother and cannot pay a $30k hospital bill. I work really hard to make sure we HAVE insurance but what the fuck if some ""expert"" can say we are not allowed to be covered during a crisis? He was truly suffering - at one point in his psychosis, he looked at me and whispered, ""I think I need some help."" I am trying really hard to fight for him but can an insurance come really do this?

My kid is working so fucking hard to just put his life in some sort of order, he has zero acceptance of his illness but does agree that meds and therapy make him feel better. He just wants to get back to college, he lost everything he had - all his friends, his scholarship... The last thing I need is for him to be cut off from medical care. 

Sorry for the rant - but seriously this is fucked up. I don't know how to appeal this - or is it even worth trying.

I think it's gotten to a point where it is impacting her life in a negative way. I, alongside my father, think she would be happier if she were to begin taking meds again. However, it seems a bit tricky to approach this subject with her. She has never spoken with me about her mental health, and most times I try to talk about other aspects of her health (she has some unrelated medical conditions) she ignores me or tries to change the subject.

I am 23, and up until a few years ago I didn't know what my mother was struggling with. I live out of town from my parents, attending university, and one day I received a phone call from my dad where he laid the facts out for me. I wasn't surprised by the news, as I always knew my mom was different somehow. I learned that my mom has struggled with taking medication over the years, and she has gone through periods of being on them for years at a time, and off them for years at a time as well. 

Retrospectively, knowing about my mom's struggle with mental illness explains a lot of her ""strange"" behaviour I experienced as a child. I have vague childhood memories of my mother being admitted to a care facility for several days at a time, but I never knew why. She would always talk about people no one in my family knew about, or go off on seemingly unrelated tangents during conversation, connecting loosely tied ideas together that presumably make sense to her, but sound like gibberish to the rest of us. As a child, I thought she was trying to be funny, but now I understand what was happening all along.

Recently, I found out from my dad that she has been off of meds for about two years. Over these past couple years I have heard from my siblings (who still live at home) that it has been more difficult to communicate with her in the past couple years. Coming home after finishing university, I'm beginning to see this. My mom has become antagonistic towards my dad, always talking about his supposed secret life with another family (which is most definitely not true). She often talks about how she believes people in the neighbourhood are coming into our house at all hours of the night and stealing from us. My sister refuses to be seen with her in public out of embarrassment of my mom's off-the-wall behaviour.

What is puzzling is that at times she is the most rational and together member of our family, and at other times she is almost entirely incoherent. It seems to my family however, that more times than not in recent months, the times she is incoherent outweighs the times she is thinking straight. She has all but refused to engage with my dad's side of the family in the past couple years, skipping birthdays and holidays. She doesn't really socialize with anyone. She has been unemployed for years. She wants to find some sort of work, but her problems in communicating with people is clearly holding her back. She also has refused to speak with my dad about some financial matters that effect the day-to-day dealings of my family (money for food, health expenditures, etc.). Most concerning to me is that she is ignoring medical appointments when she is pre-diabetic, has a family history of eye problems, and she has thrown out her back in some way that prevented her from leaving the house for months. I want her to be happy and healthy, but I think that her refusal to go back on meds is clouding her reason. I understand that these meds have to have some sort of negative side-effects, many of which are probably terrible, but surely the positive effects must outweigh the negative(?)

What advice can you give me to get her to talk frankly with me about these issues? I have tried speaking with her about a lot of these issues over the past couple years but I simply cannot get anywhere with her.","['nsubj', 'dobj']",1,neu_vader

Almost two years ago, I met my boyfriend right here on reddit. I'm currently 31 and he's 29. Pretty immediately, we were drawn to each other. I was smitten right away- he's extremely intelligent, hilarious, witty, charming, good looking, and we had so much in common. We only live 6 hours away from each other, so that was an added bonus. We quickly began talking on the phone for hours and hours at a time. I would stay up all night talking to him, sleep for an hour, then go to work and do it all over again. When I met him, he had an office job and lived on his own.

About 2 months into talking, he quit his job rather abruptly and moved back in with his dad. He said he was trying to figure out what was next for him, saving money, etc. About a month later, he decided he would start drinking at 10 am, and proceeded to get hammered (he told me when we started talking that he never drank anymore because it made him 'crazy'). He called me several times that day, ranting and raving and it was completely out of character. Then, I didn't hear from him until hours later when he called and very calmly told me he had tried to hang himself. Fortunately, the closet rod he had hung from had snapped but he was unconscious by that point and his dad had found him on the floor of the closet with a belt around his neck. 

I was stunned, scared, shocked, a million other things. He told me he had been feeling incredibly depressed but hadn't wanted to worry me about it. We became even closer after that, with me promising to be there for him if he felt that low again. During the two months following that, he had several ups and downs and his behavior towards me was erratic. He made two different plans to drive down and visit me but cancelled both times on the day of the trip with not much explanation given. Still, I stuck around. 

He then decided to enter himself into an inpatient psychiatric center for his depression and major anxiety issues. I was relieved but worried for the entire 10 days he was in there. When he came out, he informed me he had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and after doing a lot of reading on it, I totally agreed with that diagnosis. He was put on seroquel, paxil, and another medicine that I can't remember to help him sleep. He had a rough couple months getting used to the medications but then he was better. Much better. Almost completely normal, besides the occasional mood swing. We talked about going back to school together, moving in together, possibly having kids together. Keep in mind that we still haven't met in person and it's now been almost a year that we've been ""together"". We made plans, they would be cancelled, or he'd pick a fight with me right before we were supposed to meet up.

I started recognizing his patterns and avoided things that would upset him or cause episodes. At this point, I'm fiercely protective of him and love him, so moving on isn't even on my radar. Things get better, and better, and better. He's taking his meds, he's seeing his psychologist and psychiatrist like he's supposed to, and he's improving.

During all this time, however, he smoked weed. A lot. I read that can sometimes trigger psychosis and he's mentioned it as well, but he self medicated with marijuana to help his anxiety which did seem to be getting worse and worse even though his depression was completely gone (according to him).

Cut to October. We made plans for me to drive to where he is, I booked a hotel, I used vacation days at work, and we had it all planned for months. One week before I was supposed to go, he vanishes. Stops calling, ignores my calls and texts. In the back of my mind, I knew he was flaking out yet again but then again, I was concerned that something bad had happened so I reached out to his mom (I had her number from way back in the beginning when she called me after his suicide attempt). She got in touch with him and told him I called, and then he called me soon after. At first, he acted like nothing had happened, like he hadn't disappeared for a week and we hadn't had an entire visit planned. I called him out on it, and he flipped- broke up with me, told me we couldn't be together because of all these bullshit reasons, was a complete asshole. The next day, he apologized, took it all back, said he was just in a bad mind space and he needed to go to his psych doc to figure it out.

I forgave him. Again. Supported him, because I love the guy. Still do, by the way. We became even closer, somehow. However, I could tell something was off. His anxiety was worse. He complained about not being able to sleep. Then he stopped taking his seroquel, because he said it made his heart race. He became extremely delusional about his health, convinced he had cancer. During November, he went to the ER 9 different times (seriously) because he was convinced he was dying. He would say, ""I know this is ridiculous but I can't help it."" I would be supportive but inside, I was getting more and more worried. Me and his mom talked often, comparing notes on his behavior. Three weeks ago, he finally decided to check himself back into that psychiatric center he went to last year to get his medications changed and to get counseling. He was there for 6 days, they changed his medications, and when he came out, he said he felt better than ever. He saw his psychologist the next day, and even he said that he seemed better than ever. 

He wasn't. That night, he went off the rails again, convinced he had cancer and that his heart was racing, and checked himself into a different hospital. When he called me from the hospital the next morning, he admitted he had been hearing voices. He hadn't wanted to tell me because he was extremely embarrassed, and apparently had even hid it from his psychiatrist. He's been in this place for over a week now, and I'm not sure he's getting any better. They changed his diagnosis to straight schizophrenia, and he's struggling with accepting that due to the social stigma. They've changed his medications (again) and he's having a rough go of it in there. 

I'm not sure what's next for him. He's so smart and capable and I keep reassuring him that he can lead a normal life once his medications are right. He told me that I'm his rock, and I'm glad to be there for him but I'm scared. Is there a chance at a better life for him? 

I'm sorry this is so long. I needed to get it out. I care for him, so very much and I want the best for him. Besides being there for him, what can I do to help? I appreciate any feedback. Thanks.","['conj', 'nsubj', 'dobj']",1,neu_vader
