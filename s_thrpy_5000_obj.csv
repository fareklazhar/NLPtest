I was wondering if anyone could give me some tips, I trying my best to focus on the progress i made so far through therapy, yet last weekend and last night I had a bit of a set back 

to keep it brief my flatmate had some friends over (some of which i know) yet on both occasions i just stayed in my room and could not even bring my self to make even a short appearance; even just to say Hello 

This inability to talk to other people has made me feel like any progress i made so far is pretty much worthless, it's like i just barely climbed to the top of a mountain only to find that there's another one waiting for me 

i'm struggling to tell my self good things about myself with out thinking that i'm being some big headed egotistical jerk off 

I mean yeah people do seem to be genuinely happy to see me / have me around; but its like I cant see what they see 

I do realize that the feelings i have about my self are untrue; but i'm really struggling to switch my focus away from them
