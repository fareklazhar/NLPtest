There are quite a few messages in the movie, but the one I took away the most is that all the emotions that are numed with meds are very important for the evolution and expression of yourself.

Now I'm not saying that you should stop meds all together, but that you should always keep searching for a substance and dose which allow you to be all you can be while having manageable symptoms.  I've been lucky enough to have a doctor that's willing to experiment with my meds and find a dose that allows me to be me.  My team has done much more than just written up a script every month, they've taught and enhanced my coping mechanisims to deal with the disease.

I guess this post is trying to impart 3 wisdoms; never give up on meds just because a certain one gets you down, respect your doctor's opinion while keeping them informed on your experiences, and don't treat meds as a cure-all.  You are responsible for your own health, taking a pill every night is only part of the equation.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

I feel like this life that I'm doing well in isn't the real thing, because the medication covers the real thing. The real me. The real me should be dead at this point. The meds interfere. 

I am possibly moving back with my mom in a month or so, and she is iffy about my meds. Doesn't want me to take 'em but doesn't quite stop me.

So I feel like when I move back I'm going to either get depressed and tempted to overdose or stop taking 'em altogether. 

Maybe I shouldn't move back. But I want to. There are pros and cons.

Why do we get these feelings of stopping meds? Every time I'm in control of my medication I get this temptation. Like oh now I can break the rules, find the ""real"" me by getting sick again. 

The more I think about it the more uncertain I am. Which is good, I suppose.

I get these crazy thoughts, like, ""what if I get ridiculously drunk and talk to my voices? What would they say?""

Going back to my mom's is a very bad idea, but I need to do it for financial purposes.

Part of me wants to get sick again. Part of me wants it to be really bad AGAIN. Like every few weeks I get tempted to be symptomatic. 

I miss them. I guess I'm just a type of lonely. Want to connect with anything that understands and my voices were right in the madness. They knew me. 

Anyhow, this is mostly just getting this stuff out. I don't plan on stopping meds, I don't think I will. Everything is just in the air, floating.

I assume there are varying degrees of the illness and some people are able to function better than others. My mother has not been able to live on her own or take care of herself for at least 10 years. She rarely takes a shower, has lots of delusions, hears voices, etc. 

She has taken several medications (Invega, Risperadone, and other's that I can't remember) - right now she's on risperidone. The medicine keeps her from screaming all hours of the day, but the other symptoms are still present. 

I am encouraged when I read this subreddit. It seems that mostly everyone here has managed to get their symptoms under control and live (mostly) normal lives. I really want that for my mother. I really want to see her the way I know she really is deep down inside. 

I wonder if she will always be this way or if we have just not found the right combination of medication. My question is... do you think it's possible that she just needs a different medicine, a higher dosage, or is it just that some people are far worse than others and there's nothing that can be done about it?

I saw some pundits on CNN question whether people with certain mental illness should be banned from certain professions.

I have googled employment discrimination and mental illness and it seems that in the UK in 2013 a bill was passed which repeals previous laws that prevented people with mental illness from holding parliamentary office as well as being directors of corporations. 

With all the talk about gay rights etc... Here's a real human rights issue that is completely being ignored.

Mentally ill people can be treated, recover and lead productive lives. To start putting limits on what they can and cannot do just because someone killed people is the epitome of discrimination and stigma. 

Here you have a class of people who a lot of them differ from the general population in that they have to take some sort of medication and the media is  putting people who want to prevent them from working and earning their living.

What if the story was ""Should muslims be prevented from flying a plane"" or ""should gays be prevented from being boyscouts"". Would that pass on CNN? No. But a pundit is allowed to discuss whether it is right to prevent the mentally ill from holing jobs. 

And before you say well it is only for high responsibility jobs, well think about it this way? Which job is not high responsibility? I work in software development and have been the lead software engineer on multi-million dollars projects. Isn't that a high responsibility job?

I don't know if it would have developed without these drugs but he hasn't been the same ever since.

Every few months he goes insane and wanders the street endlessly, he believes there are ghosts in his house so he avoids it , at one point he said he was going to burn his house down(cops came at this point).

Not the most diligent student, but I always got the highest score and/or broke the curve on tests. I hated doing homework, because I got things quickly. I also had behavioral problems growing up, from a stressful home life.

I started to hear voices when I was 17. I became very fearful, delusional and paranoid. I was too anxious from these symptoms to  go to school my senior year. I just dropped out. My parents then (and unfortunately still) did not recognize this as an illness, but me being a jerk. They told me to move out on my own. I wouldn't go get a job and lived on my savings. 

I really wasn't making any sense. My brain was creating all the evidence necessary to live in my own private reality. One of my roommates offered me a hit of a joint and the voices started in earnest. I went from occasional mishearing or repeating voices, to all out psychosis. I was in the hospital for a month with terrifying delusions. 

I was lucky that living with a relative calmed my voices down. I was no longer curious what anyone had to say that was not physically there. Fool me once dammit. I really didn't suffer from hallucinations again until a few years later. I worked through the hallucinations, treating customers like nothing was wrong. 

Life got much easier once I was hospitalized for trying to kill myself after a messy breakup. I have never been hospitalized for psychosis or not understood where I was again. They put me on risperdal and asked if I heard voices. Golly gee they were gone.

Had to get through a few years of not being able to afford them, if I could get them I would take them everyday for a while. Then just take them to stop symptoms. Not saying that would work for everyone, but that was all I could afford.

I know several people that have had their first episode in college. This disease does not care if you are at an expensive school. Many of them are straddled with debt and a bad transcript. How is it legal to collect tuition from someone who is sick? How come most other illnesses get special treatment and classrooms in public schools. Why is there nothing special about our education?

One in a hundred people has schizophrenia.

One is sixty-eight is on the autism spectrum. (possibly fitting regular classes).

One in a hundred chance of downs would only happen if all mothers waited until 40 years old. 

Just because this disease presents at an age that is outside the public schooling range, does not mean that we are SOL and should just wander the streets and live out of dumpsters. Just because our disease scares idiots does not mean we have no civil rights.

I've always assumed there is no way someone with schizophrenia can make it through the original tumult and keep any scholarships they might have earned before. Everyone over 24 or whose parents make less than 84,000 a year qualifies for Pell Grants to go to school in the US. This completely covers community college or most of a public university. 

I recommend transferring from a community college. Only the University you get your BA from is on your resume anyway. It also gives you time to take it slowly if you need to. I only recommend going to school if you consider it a privilege. If you don't want to be there don't go.

I am enrolled in a Disability Rehabilitation program. I did well with my work case, so they are going to open an education one. I didn't really know what that meant until this week. Right now I am about to get my AS, I have Pell grants so it is free. I am going to transfer to university soon and assumed I would just take out loans to cover the extra cost.

They told me this week that they will cover any tuition the pell doesn't for my BA. If I make it into grad school (where there are no pells), they are willing to cover everything but 10% good faith payments. I am still wonderfully grateful and ecstatic.

They also asked if I needed help now. They could help people too young to file independently on their FAFSA. Or as I like to call it the caste of people born to parents too cruel to take ten minutes to enter tax information. Why is that fair to victims of abuse? Too many people scamming? IDK. It sucks, been there. 

So who are THEY? Forgot that part. This is the Department of Human Services, Division of Rehabilitation Services. I am not getting disability, but I've filed. I probably wont qualify but this is way better. 

I don't know how much funding these guys get. I don't know how they split it between people like us, in wheelchairs and the blind. I just wanted to put my story out there to give someone a bit of hope. There are plenty of other kinds of scholarships if you can write an essay.

I am my caseworker's only client with grades to qualify. I also don't argue with her about meds and basically don't make drama for myself. 

TLDR- DHS Division of Rehabilitation Services gives employment outreach and scholarships. Might have to politely ask around to find equivalent department in your state.

I’m not even sure if this is the right forum but it seems like the most populated with similar situations so I’m going to just put this out there and hoping someone here may be able to give some advice or peace of mind.

In the summer, we had a very minor conflict with the next door neighbours since our patios are side by side. Long story short we complained to our superintendent and everything seemed to simmer down and not be an issue with future conflicts. Despite there being no conflicts, my wife had been occasionally using crystal meth and her continued paranoia built up this story about how those neighbours are in cahoots with the superintendent and even working with our neighbours on the other side of the building (who are not even managed under the same landlord or superintendent).  She thinks:

* That there is an investigation being done into her being a drug dealer (which she isn’t), or into her friend being a drug dealer (which she isn’t)
* That there are cameras and microphones hidden throughout our house, mostly in our master bedroom and en suite bathroom. 
* Her cell phone is being bugged. I catch her writing long rants into the address bar of her phone web browser, thinking she is typing a message that our superintendent will be able to read. 
* That there are private investigators following her when she leaves the house in our car, or are watching us from the building across the street from where we live.
* The landlord is trying to have her committed, and is going to have an ambulance sent to the house to have her taken to a hospital.

These are just a few of the things that over the last 7 months has built up into this incredibly stressful and frustrating experience. She hears voices of the landlord and the neighbours we had the conflict with, and even the neighbours we’ve never actually engaged with. She thinks she can hear them calling her a bitch and other names, and plotting this master scheme against us be it legal action, law suits, criminal charges, and mental hospitalization. For months she thought these voices were happening outside the house, so I’d go walking around the building, even onto the restaurants patio below us to investigate if the people she thinks are there. I’ve had to come home early from work repeatedly because she thinks these people and the police are outside the house scheming her arrest or charging her with crimes. Every time, there is no one there.
After many months of hoping that she would come to her senses with the reality of the situation, I finally broke down and agreed to move since it was only in the house that she hears the voices. We’ve found a new place in a new neighbourhood, scheduled to move in on February 1.

Last month, she was so convinced that there were cameras in our house, she would hand me screws and tell me how there are cameras in them (regular screws she pulled out of the lighting fixtures)… I tried pointing out online what actual screw cameras look like, needing transmitters and such but that also had no benefit. So then one day I receive a call from a mental health worker who was brought to the house when she called the police to report these cameras. They are suggesting taking her to a local mental health hospital because naturally, the cops can’t actually find any cameras. There she was told she was dealing with a drug induced psychosis and sent home with a referral for a psychiatrist. 
Since this incident (about 5 weeks), she has not done meth, however is still completely bought into this delusion, and adamant that there are cameras in the house and that the voices she hears is real. She also refuses to accept that any sort of psychosis is in play. 
Despite this, in the last 2 weeks she has 1) bought a $450 bug scanner to search for cameras and microphones 2) spent $350 on vet visits because she thinks someone poisoned our cats 3) Bought $70 phone tracking software that logs all emails and text messages remotely (which I really don’t understand, since this does exactly what she doesn’t want to be done to her phone) 4) paid someone to house sit for a day so she could leave for appointments because she thinks that when she leaves someone will come in and poison the cats or take out all the cameras 5) dug holes into multiple walls in search of these cameras. To her credit, she has somehow developed a masterful skill of repatching these walls and matching paint so that any damage is visibly minimal 5) She currently has handwritten letters posted to the back of the bathroom door addressed to the superintendent that she believes has this camera access.
All of this tells me that she is not taking the opinions of myself, the Dr she saw at the hospital, or even the psychotherapist she has seen in the interim.

This brings concern to me because if she is in denial, even when she meets with the psychiatrist they won’t be able to do anything since they don’t know the real story. She has been seeing a psychotherapist in the interim and I even went and had a session on my own with her as well and the Dr seems very empathic to my situation but didn’t really bring any solutions to the table other than waiting to see what happens after we move.
Today she went to her appointment with the psychiatrist. I haven’t actually spoken with her yet but based on the text message I received the Doctor simply suggested it was depression and offered a higher grade medication (she has been using Seroquel at night to help sleep since going to the hospital), which she declined.

So…. How do I get her to agree that there may be something bigger going on? Do I just literally leave the topic alone hoping that once we move it will all stop? I’m literally at a loss for what to do at this point because despite repeatedly proving to her that her concerns are not real, its clear that didn’t work and I don’t know what else to do. If it adds any context into local healthcare, I will divulge we are in Ontario, Canada. Thanks for listening.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

Not suicidal or anything along those lines, would fail, anyway, and don't want to be put away in their collective hell anyway. 
So, now, there is an underlying drive to ramble, or write, or some combination of the both. Can't turn to family, don't want to burden friends, cannot return to the EVIL mental health workers, they only want money and more sessions and to put us on poison so that we continue living in some state of alternate consciousness but with the terrifying reality of side-effects and lethargy. Just becoming a burden it seems, fragile wings, and the sound is like a hurricane, no brains. But, maybe, by some force of will should I continue. Should i gather my thoughts and press forwards I could maybe even see some light at the end of a tunnel? Yes! No. It's just a train, after all. 
So where do I go from here? I can't go back to the therapists, they're evil, they make the wrong decisions (such as hospitalization, upon which there is really a collective hell, take the people needing love and kindness and lock them up like sheep in the field, number them, and brand them with their little wristbands. Make sure they don't die, that's the goal, much like a shepherd, no dying, but there's no care either. Only for use when they're ripe for the sheering. Or the medicines, which they collectively shove down your throat almost like a ritual in the early hours of the morning when you're hardly awake and other times when you're so tired from their drug-induce seditive that you're falling asleep) and they cut you off from the world too. No phone, no computer, no visits (for someone like me. Who would want to visit me?) and the fear. The undenying fear. I can't let them take me back there. I was hell, not insomuch like my mind, but maybe-- just--- maybe. 
So where do I go, who to turn to, not someone in danger of locking me up and throwing away the key. No poisons, no poisons, not anymore. Don't want to die, like I said, won't harm me. Won't harm anyone else. I'm not violent, never was, don't intend to be. They won't-- LISTEN. Show them the writings, but they never listen, don't understand the underlying protocols that were trying to be expressed. Ha! No. But I digress. 
If you know what I could do, that would be helpful. Please don't suggest the poison to, I know many of you have succumbed to it's mind-altering effects that convince you that it's actually /good/. Or the therapist. They're just evil prying mental leeches that only care more about their next paycheck than ACTUALLY listening. They were the ones that put me into the state that suggested I go to that mental hell. Ok, was not, I seem to be fine functioning on my own anyway.","['npadvmod', 'pobj']",-1,neu_vader

To start off I am schizophrenic and have borderline personality disorder.

I am not on any medication and have discontinued seeing my therapist because she doesn't understand at all. I don't have a car or insurance so I can't really have access to regular help.

I often ignore and dissociate my mental aliments until I can't anymore. Like this morning I woke up and immediately knew I couldn't go into work, my symptoms get worst when I am stressed. I called out of work, my manager usually is understanding. (Only done this two other times in a span of 2 months) This time she said that I ""need to step up my game."" I am one of the hardest working people there (I work in a boat house and am moving heavy equipment and dealing with people everyday) I am over loading myself with effort and I also am putting in everything I've got.

The paranoia, voices, and delusions are getting worse. 
Voices before I go to sleep, it sounds like a distant TV and the volume gets turned up and down. The delusions are concerning me the most. I think most people are demons, I feel like everyone has plotted against me, how to make my life more miserable and difficult. I am in a new relationship and I'm convinced he is a demon and it feels really weird. I try to convince myself this is all bullshit but it feels like sheer realty. I was a Christian a few weeks ago, but I find all my values with that are slipping away. My belief system has always been important to me, now it's out of whack.

I feel as if I'm skipping around I can't remember the day before me or sometimes even five minutes. 

I feel like when I try to explain it all my brain won't let me remember until its happening again...

Basically I want to admit myself into the mental ward. I don't feel like I belong on the outside world, I don't feel safe anywhere. I want to be in the hospital for a little while. I need them to help me, the problem is I don't even know what they would do.. and would they accept me? I don't really want to die, but I just don't feel safe around others. I feel like people are hurting me, and taking my energy. I feel like the sadness, and melancholy are never going to end. 

I've never told a professional my lengths of believing in demons and good energies among us, I believe I am a omen of good energy in this world. No one understands, I know I'm a little out there but if I try to explain this to a doctor; what will they do to me?
I don't think i'll give up my beliefs of this ever. These beliefs I have though are controlling my life and I can't stand it... please help me and give me any advice or personal experiences you can.. Everyone is a demon except for my dad to me, this is very unsettling and I'm not scared as much as just overwhelmed and I want it to end.

I’m 23 now and about three years ago I started using marijuana heavily for about a year (almost every day). A year later, two years ago, I took a heavy dose of magic mushrooms (psilocybin) and was hospitalised two days afterwards because I was psychotic. I had all sorts of delusions and hallucinations: I thought I was in the future, I thought I was God for a while, and I thought government spies were out to kill me. All within this two day period after I had taken the mushrooms.

After being hospitalised for a couple of days and then released because I was stable, I used cannabis within two weeks and began getting psychotic again. This period lasted for about a month or so (I don’t really remember it too well) and it involved delusions about the Curiosity rover on Mars (I believed that it found signs of extraterrestrial life). This was when I was first prescribed Risperidone at 2mg. After a family trip a couple of months later, I quit using my medicine and for the next two years felt pretty much fine without it. I had forgotten about my “bad trip” and was feeling pretty normal. I even used cannabis a couple of times without triggering a psychosis. 

Cut to two years later. I accidentally digested a cannabis brownie (or something dubious) and became psychotic a couple of days afterwards. This psychotic episode lasted 6-7 months and involved delusions that the government was watching me from a high-rise building I can see from my window and that the third world war had begun, among others. This led to my hospitalisation which lasted about a month and a half after which they diagnosed me with schizophrenia.

I currently feel like not doing anything at all (avolition?) and have no pleasure in things that used to be pleasurable (anhedonia?) which I admit are negative symptoms. But otherwise, while on 4mg Risperidone, I have not had any hallucinations or delusions whatsoever for a good 4-5 months.

Recently my sister, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia almost two decades ago, has taken a turn for the worst. I know a bit about the disease, but I am quite uncertain about some of her other behaviors. I'll briefly detail her progression in the past 15-20 years and hopefully someone can better help me understand why she's the way she is now and what I can expect to see in the future.


-At around at 16-17, she came home one day from school paranoid that people are out to get her.

-Eventually, she dropped out of school due to her weird behavior. She would often burst out crying for no reason and complain about voices.

-Parents, being religious, never took her illness seriously and thought it was a ""spiritual disease"".

-Fast forward a few years and she was officially diagnosed with schizophrenia. Given medicine that she would take daily making her sleepy.

-My sister's outburst became less but she seemed to have developed a lot of OCD behavior. She would wander the house a lot, opening drawers and banging them loudly. She started developing an unhealthy obsession with her hair. She would wash and maintain it often. She would also sit and stare at nothing and laugh uncontrollably.

-She lost weight but nothing I would deem worrisome. Her appetite was still okay. This went on for a good 10+ years while living at home.

-My mom passed away 3 years ago this coming April. Since then, my sister's condition seemed to have worsen. She no longer cares about her hair. She elected to go bald. She shaved her eyebrows. She has no access to a razor so she steals it from the store to do this. Despite having no hair, she still has an unhealthy obsession with washing her hair. If you take shampoo away from her, she would use dishwasher soap. If you take that way, she would use toothpaste. Anything she can get her hands on that is considered a cleaning agent.

But what I'm most worried about is her physical state of being. She's lost so much weight. She's now around 80 lbs and looks anorexic. She doesn't eat much at all. She looks like a completely different person. I've never seen her smile anymore. Often she would say that my mom comes to her at night and it scares her. She's developed some other new, weird habits. She would leave the house without telling anyone. On two occasions, she broke all of the picture frames in our living room and tore up the pictures in the middle of the night. When asked why she did this, she said someone told her to do it. She's much more catatonic than before and would often just sit there and stare at nothingness. 

There's a lot more stuff but those were the main things I've observed or was told about. She's still taking medications so I'm not quite sure what's going on. Are the medication supposed to be less effective with time? Is this related to the death of my mom (who was the sole caretaker of her for the past two decades prior to passing away)? If so, why is she so afraid of my mom when she sees her at night? My mom loved her to death and wouldn't allow us to put her in a home while she was still alive.

Right now we're at a point where we have to put my sister in a home because it's continuing to tear our family apart. No one has the capability to take care of her at home. It's literally a 24/7 job to do so, which makes us realize how patient my mom was being able to do it for 20 years straight. 

The home we are putting her in is with 3 other individuals and a round the clock nurse. They'll be living in an actual home with their own bedrooms. They're supposed to learn social and life skills while there. We are hoping she'll get the attention she needs and things will change, especially her health.

No one was allowed to talk, only whisper, and often she'd have people walk in random directions to ""throw them off"". Shortly after this started, she began to feel shocks. She claimed the people upstairs knew the people under us and she thinks they have some kind of machine on their ceiling to send electricity threw the floor and electrocute her. Also somehow she's the only one who can feel this electric and vibrations. Eventually she felt like she couldn't live there anymore and left to stay with a family member.

Fast forward 4 months, we moved so she could live with us again. This time we live on the top floor so no one is over us and ""listening to us"". This seem fine for a few days but she starts feeling the shocking feelings again. She then claims that the people downstairs from us now knows the people who used to live under and over us and are doing the same thing to drive her insane. After about a month, again she can barely live with us and starts staying with family. Mind you, she claims she can feel it at family's homes too and says that they must have been following her. She has been feeling it at my aunt's place and believes that the people who live over and under my aunt also knows the people who live under us who knows the people who lived under and over us at our old place. She also says that the maintenance workers for the apartment complex and some of the Comcast works are involved.

So right now she's in the hospital and I need some advice on what to do or what I can do to help. Let me give you a bit more information though. This is her second trip to the hospital in the last 3 months, third in the last two years. About two years ago, she attempted suicide by overdose. While she was in the hospital two years ago, I believe they diagnosed her with a mild case of schizophrenia but primarily depression. They gave her medication for depression which she said she was having allergic reactions too and stopped taking it. For a little less than a year after this, she seemed fine until the believe people were stalking her thing. While she was in the hospital about a month ago, they said she had delusional disorder. Since we don't have health insurance, she wasn't able to get any medication immediately. They said for her to get free medication she would have to also see a therapist and they will contact her when they have all the information for it. They sent her home with no perscription and haven't contacted her.

So after saying she felt like she was being electrocuted at my aunt's place last night, we brought her back to the ER because she was considering suicide again. No one really has any idea what to do now because it's just going to be a cycle of her coming home, feeling shocks, going somewhere else, still feeling it, gets really bad, taking her to the ER.

TL;DR - Mother things people are following her and electrocuting her through the floor. She had no medication because of no healthcare. Any advice?

And I have friends and family that love me, care about me well-being, and I can't get these thoughts about how I'm doomed to deal with reality issues forever, about how I have all these factors that make me want to kill myself, and I just.. I want to go. I want some peace.. but it's so stupid to want it. I have people on my side and I can't get suicide out of my head. What is wrong with me? 

I'm so scared of the future. The reality of it all. Am I wrong? Are my ""delusions"" really so? 

I'm so sick with this uncertainty. This nauseating feeling of ""what-if"". Of what if my voices are people from another dimension? What if they're really at the mercy of my big bad pedophile monster that won't let them be? What if I'm really the only one that can stop him, and I'm sitting here popping pills to quiet their cries for help? What if all the people on the street were put there to watch me by him? To make sure I felt crazy and sick and broken? To make sure I live because of his sickness but to make sure I can't stop him? 

What happens when I get to the other dimension by killing myself? I don't even know how I'd stop him, am I capable of killing him? Does he even hold the same physical existence? 

I just got out of a mental hospital on Monday. I don't wanna go back, but I'm not too sure I'm ready to be out in the 'verse. I'm not sure I'm right, I'm not 100%. 

I hate our struggle. I hate not knowing. Being so scared of people. Are they watching? Reading my mind? Controlling me? Do I hold any power in my own decisions or are they left for someone else to decide?

Wost of all, my case manager keeps saying i'm going to end up in a long-term facility if I keep getting hospitalized. So now I have to worry about getting my freedom taken away for getting sick too often. Well, fuck. Do I even have any options for my future left? At this rate I'm going to end up spending the rest of my life in a long-term facility at one point. 

I just feel overwhelmed. Suffocating here. Want to scream. Want to rage. Want to understand. 

No one but you guys understand. No one gets it. I have to question everything to try and protect myself from delusions. it's so draining. I'm tired. 

Please someone, just tell me it changes from this. It gets better, that there's some peace in schizophrenia somewhere.

I currently take a cocktail of medications. However some of my ""delusions"" I am sure are occurring in real life. I told a friend that I have not watched television, or internet video for almost two years, because I was sure that people were talking about me on it. Until today he thought that was impossible, however, since he is fan of football he picked up something on the pitch today that might indicated someone is talking about me.

ome emailed me link to an ESPN video, I do not like soccer, but someone was talking about me on the field. If you listen carefully, a person in the crowd yells ""The know him, he twenty, and he is not reading"". I do not know why everyone is talking about me, and I do know how to read. I really hate people. I do not even live in England.

If you listen carefully to the short clip, you will hear someone saying, ""they know him, he is 20, and he is not reading"". I am sure that he is talking about me, even though I do not live in England, I only have distant relatives there and I live in the states.
I only use my computer for an hour a day, I have an old computer that I keep on all day and have it run automated Google searches. I think that someone is monitoring my internet activity, because I hear my neighbor say that I was on the internet all day. He only think this if someone was hacking my computer, although hacking the wrong one. I am worried about my banking because of this.

As far as not reading is concerned, I did extremely well on my GRE exams (167 Verbal Reasoning, 155 Quantitative) , my GPA is relatively high, and it is impossible to do well on the GRE, without having read any material, it is the only objective criteria for evaluating an undergraduate student. I am not saying that the test depicts the student in their totality, but it unlikely that you do well on it while being illiterate. I am certain that the scores of the people attacking me are lower.

Why is this of concern? I am a diagnosed schizophrenic, it hard for me to get people to believe that I am hearing others because of the diagnosis. I sometimes experience thing which are unreal, but I think people are using this to their advantage.

 I do not follow soccer, and the game may have taken place in the States with English teams playing overseas, but in any event, no one really should be talking about me at all.

Another person emailed me and said that some of the people in the video might talking about me as well. I did not watch this one, but I will post it anyway.

So I'm trying to prepare.  With my mother, meds were the issue.  Classic story, right?  Go on meds.  Feel better.  Don't think she needs them.  Go off meds.  Symptoms worsen.  (Rinse. Repeat. )  So I started giving my kid a vitamin each morning.  The idea is stressed that even though her body feels fine, she needs this vitamin.  If we forget to take it we'll turn back around and walk home to get it.  She's had the school nurse call me twice to say she forgot to take it and I brought it to her immediately.  Take the meds no matter what! That's the mantra.  Hoping it builds routine. 


But what else?  If you have a diagnosis, looking back, what might have helped you?  If you're on the team of someone, what have you done that you think was a success and what was less successful?

I can't think or be spontaneous, so this will have to be a vague approximation of my situation. I have posted here before (I can't recall my old login details) and didn't get much input, likely as I stated nothing can help me. I hate to be ungrateful but no one could be grateful in my position. I will tell you some ""personal"" things, as I have no boundaries, total amnesia and can only vaguely recall the bad and ill things I once did. This will likely jump around a bit and I will understand if no one wants to read it all; I may not be able to feel real gratitude but I have no sense of entitlement and don't expect a lot. If I could be any other way or had one thing to live for, I would embrace it and wouldn't be telling my pathetic story online.

I have told people about the trauma at ten that killed the original Elijah and left a succession of mostly fake Els. It sounds pathetic written down or even spoken, which makes it even worse, and even when people believe it they can't see how it destroyed the original me and eventually killed the false selves I was performing with from ten to 25. 

I have no awareness of what should be private and no theory of mind, so I will pointlessly tell you what happened. Till ten I was very loving, with a loving family; I was extremely bright and motivated, always top of my class; I had a magical nascent libido with posters of women on my ceiling and a stash of topless pictures; I was into almost all kinds of music and felt magical listening to it; I was wise for my age; and I was sporty and popular.

At ten I came home muddy from playing soccer in school, which wasn't unusual. I have no memory because of what happened but I know my dad was downstairs talking to his friend, Phil; they were both musicians and would chat for hours about 50s rock and roll and 60s R 'n' B. I acknowledged my dad and Phil, like I naturally did up to that time, and went to the bathroom to get clean. I washed down with the cold shower attachment (my mum had told me cold showers were invigorating) and, for some reason, sprayed my genitals with ice-cold water at close range. My penis -- which had been growing well -- shrank tiny and I panicked like hell. It wasn't normal cold water retraction that most guys experience, because I left my body and reality and my mental reaction affected the physical and my penis didn't go back to normal.

I remember nothing as I wiped my original, true self when it happened and can't have made any real memories, just very fuzzy, weird ones and they all died at 25 when I did. I know somehow, though, I looked down my pants the next day, alone in the hall, and realised with abject terror and disgust that my precious penis was virtually just a nub where it had once been. I couldn't deal with it, so I became largely disconnected from my body and consensus reality, as defence mechanisms, and after a few years I turned to alcohol and religion, things which had never really interested me before the trauma.

I started listening exclusively to gangsta rap, as I wanted to childishly offend a world that had castrated me, although I blocked out the trauma totally for fifteen years. My dad hated such angry music and he lost his real son in myriad other ways: I no longer talked to my family; I recoiled in horror if my dad touched me; I stop doing homework or paying attention in school; in my late teens I started self-harming and making suicide attempts, etc. In the end the stress I caused made him very ill and he died because of me when I was twenty. I can't even make myself care, as I have no memory or concept of him and can't generate feelings.

Anyway, I will try and get to my current problems, although they were set in motion by the past, so I don't know what's relevant. I moved to a city at 21 because my best friend saw I was stagnating in my hometown, nocturnal, often drunk and not doing much save for posting on a message board. I erased all my skills at ten and didn't learn how to look after myself; my mum did it all. In the city my friend basically did everything functional for me but I was already paranoid and believed he was wrecking my life.

I didn't lose my virginity till 21 and in a city, as I had ""poisoned"" my hometown and was thought of as a frigid weirdo, which I was without knowing it. I dated the girl I lost my virginity to (Ellie) for about five weeks and then she ended it because I was a ""drain"" and because I went totally loopy off wine and sleeping pills. I obsessed about her for the next four years, like I obsessed about one girl all through high school. I didn't talk to the girl in school, though, whereas I kept in touch with Ellie via email when she moved city.

I finally enrolled at university at 22, choosing my subject largely because Ellie had done the same. I only went in a handful of times because of my psychological and neurological problems, like social phobia and not being able to map or picture anything, preventing me from finding my way around campus. I met a Finnish girl called Saara and was quite charming and confident when drunk at that time, so I managed to chat her up in my own weird way and we ended up dating and living together for three years, till my ""breakdown"".

I was very affectionate with Saara a lot of the time, but was a terrible boyfriend, really, as I was always drunk or high on MDMA, kept in touch with Ellie, and cheated with prostitutes. Anyway, after three years university was finishing and I was meant to be facing the adult world for the first time. The trauma came back to me but initially I dismissed it as a false memory and decided my dad's friend Phil had sexually abused me. I spun an elaborate tale, which I believed, and got Valium from a doctor. I took it all, ""remembered"" my dad abusing me and I went into shock. I know I was never abused.

Saara called an ambulance for me but then I came round and was totally psychotic, not going in the ambulance as it was taking me to be tortured, and thinking Saara was CIA. Well, I had to move back in with my mum and my delusions got more bizarre: my dad had faked his death; I was a Jewish orphan; I was behind the Beltway sniper attacks, etc. I was on top of the world but it was terrible for my family. I had pissed off Ellie with emails and she responded with a MySpace photo of her and her boyfriend mocking my penis, my filthy secret since ten and cause of everything. I went even more insane as a defence tactic and sent her a final message saying, ""We've already killed for you."" She made it clear I couldn't contact her again and I never have.

When all the florid psychosis had faded I didn't go back to how I was but now had nothing; no thoughts, no memory, no feelings, no pleasure, no reality, no self, no libido, and was stuck with a tiny penis I had disowned as too small and not mine. After a year (lest you have any sympathy for me) I was no better and, for some reason, wanted to destroy things. I went out and set fire to some parked cars, feeling even guiltier once I did it. I got caught through DNA evidence and sent to a psychiatric hospital with a few diagnoses, including paranoid schizophrenia. 

I have been in hospital for four and a half years and just get worse. I am on clozapine but it does nothing as my symptoms have all been negative for years. I am no longer considered a risk of crime and am allowed out into the local town, on my own, once a week. I am moving hospital in the new year, somewhere closer to my hometown. 

Anyway, there is no treatment for amnesia, having no thoughts (just constant negative comments), existential paranoia, anhedonia and not being able to get tired. Alcohol hasn't even worked on me at all since my death, otherwise I would've absconded from here and gone on a bender. I haven't heard from Saara in years, she doesn't want to talk to me, and my friends have mostly deserted me. I don't really deserve help as I feel I am a kind of sociopath and can't care about myself, let alone others, as I have no self. I visited my mum last week and tried my best to act well but it was false and I was frustrated I couldn't remember her or feel for her like she obviously cared for me. 

Killing my dad was sociopathic, my crime was sociopathic, and I have done other fucked up things I won't go into, largely as I have no real memory of them, it wasn't me who did them, and (selfishly) it won't help me to confess, won't be cathartic, as nothing is anymore. Well, sorry to have rambled on but I am suffering and can't describe it succinctly. All of me wants to die but I haven't got the guts to kill myself. I don't try to manipulate people with talk of suicide, like I probably did before my demise, as it's not like someone will pull out the ""real"" medicine and advice once I talk about killing myself. Suicide just literally has been the only answer for six years and it won't change now. Well, thanks for reading if you did and I will try my best to appreciate any replies. Bye.

Here's my story:

About 10 years ago I was hospitalized for paranoid schizophrenia after years of build up (hearing voices, seeing people and things, sleep paralysis, paranoia, depression). Eventually, I was released and heavily medicated and spent years miserable and barely conscious. 

Thanks to the internet becoming more accessible to me, I found some weak links to b-12 that matched my symptoms. I started treating myself with the simple off-the-shelf vitamin. Shortly (just a few weeks) after I was able to go off my meds, and my symptoms only start to come back if I let my b-12 levels drop.

Years later, I'm finally starting to see some studies on the link between folate and b-12 levels, and schizophrenia.

I am living a life free from schizophrenia now, with the most ridiculously simple and cheap cure, with no side-effects. I only wish I had some way to try and get this information out to others it might help. So that's what brings me here today.

First, obviously, I'm not a doctor. As usual, treat things you read on the internet with a grain of salt. I tend to doubt there's a one solution fits all, but get your b-12 and folate levels checked, or take a 1-a-day b-12 vitamin for a couple weeks.

All things considered he is doing really well right now. After a short voluntary inpatient stay, he's currently working with a psychiatrist to figure out medications and is lucid the vast majority of the time, but is struggling with ups and downs and side effects. 

I am just really sad and angry for him. I am worried about how he will be able to care for himself, if he will ever be able to hold a job, or live as normal of a life as he can. I'm worried as our parents age (they are in their upper 50's right now) they won't be able to provide the support they are giving him right now and things will get worse/bad again for him. My biggest fear is that he will wind up homeless and suffering psychosis on the street somewhere because he will either not be able to afford his medications or a place to live.

I had always felt off and had a lot of social and emotional/depression problems growing up until I eventually had a psychotic breakdown soon after I turned 18. It was a horrifying experience. I was put in a mental hospital, and put on the anti-psychotic drug Zyprexa afterwards. 
 
I started to feel better after a few months except for the drug made me extremely sleepy and ravenous for food. Then I read up more about the side effects and found horror stories of the long term effects of diabetes and permanent facial twitches and disfigurement. The drug was also withering my short and long term memory. 
I became determined to find a better drug though I soon found that most of them had similar to worse side effects after researching about and trying a bunch. I felt like my life was over. I was miserable with the drug, and could probably not survive long without it(without either ending my own life or ending up at the hospital again.) All the while my boyfriend was giving me his ultimatum: to get a job so I could move in with him, or he couldn't be with me anymore.
How could I get a job when this drug makes me sedated all the time? Or when I wouldn't be able to remember anything taught to me for the job?

One night my boyfriend had been watching a health food documentary. In the film they started to talk about taking supplements, particularly Niacin and they mention how niacin supplements had been known to help people suffering with schizophrenia. Even though I don't know that he really thought it would help much, he told me about it later when I saw him that weekend. This impelled me to start researching holistic treatments instead of alternative drugs. 
   
Its been almost a year and a half since I haven't taken any anti-psychotics. Finding the right treatment for me solely though research and trial/error method without the help of anyone has been quiiite the bumpy road and I don't know that I would recommend it to everyone. It's certainly a huge obstacle to get over in life compared to most and the harsh truth is that not many people understand or have much sympathy for mental illness.
 I can say that I am extremely better off than I was on drugs:

I have had 3 jobs since I started holistic treatment, I started college, I now have a full time job that I have been with for almost a year, I moved in with my boyfriend over a year ago, I lost all the weight the Zyprexa made me gain, people tell me I look younger, I don't feel sedated all the time, my memory is back and my mind is more clear, I have learned how to cook awesome &amp; healthy meals, I don't feel like a lazy bum anymore. 

I feel like I have just started to live, like I was just born into this world where there is so much to behold and enjoy. 

This is so odd compared to how I have felt for most of my life; anxious, depressed, strung out, avoidant, loopy, delusional. I didn't think there was anything wrong with me because I had always been that way. Growing up I heard the same questions and statements reiterated ""'You're so lazy!' 'You're so helpless!' 'You never remember your homework.' 'I think you're smart but your grades fluctuate a lot.' 'Why are you so quiet? You've never spoken one word to me.' 'You've got nothing to be depressed about!' How come your parents are cool but you and your brother aren't?'""

I try to avoid telling people about this because I know it's hard to believe what with so often it being the case that a person goes off of their medication and relapses. I mean its feasible for someone inclined to delusions to think they are better when they aren't, but it's been over a year...I've never been prone to stay in a manic phase for very long xD.

It was 331 bed B a loud speaker sounded as all of the doors locked, all except the guys because we had our doors opened. We just got back from lunch so we haven’t closed our doors yet. The doors locked and we had an idea, visitors were about to come but had a suspended visit time. “FUCK!” I yelled out as some black ass head nurse told me to get in my room and shut the door. I cheeked medicine that entire week because I knew that I had to escape. We saw the keys and went for them. In fear of getting caught everyone stayed back, all except me. My mission was to grab the keys at a slightly monitored front desk and open up the elevator room doors without suspicion. I almost did it until someone noticed me eyeing the keys. I was told “No.” in a firm voice by the gay guy named Hans. He was a German dick sucking faggot. Now back to the topic. I went back to my room saying in a low quiet voice “Fuck, the gay fat ass caught me” they nodded in agreement and then the silver lining broke through. Visitors came through after they took the girl downstairs to emergency as she moaned and groaned from pain and blood loss from the fork she stole from the lunch hall. I caught the door from one of the incoming parents and attempted to walk out until my mom came in and said “no” in a very stern voice. She almost told the head desk to keep an eye out. They had their suspicions because it was like my 18th day and I kept on threatening to run away. I hated it there. My mom walked me to my room and told me to pack up that I was leaving. They all became sad that our plan was foiled and that was the only way I was escaping.

She raised me on her own, but many times I spent time in a foster home. For some 5 years now her symptomps have become worse all the time, she also doesn't want to eat medicine. All this time, she has denied the disease from herself, which is the reason she also denied all kind of therapy or help that was offered to us since my childhood, and for a long time I was clueless what was wrong with my mother. 

Now I am 18, lately I have hard time with my own depression, panic attacks, identity. My life has been so crazy and weird and without any ""plan"". I don't blame my mother because she has been sick, but lately I have been so lost, I feel like I am not a coherent person. I don't know how to explain this feeling, but sometimes it overtakes me and such times I have very dark thoughts of suicide. I feel like it is hard to have an image of myself, now that I should become a ""grown up"" person. 

I will finally go to a therapy soon, I am stuck with my life because all I can think of is my dark past.

For as long as i can remember i have heard multiple voices in my head and have seen things that are not really there. i have been delusional my whole life. I had, for lack of a better word, a episode when i was around 6-7. Now I am 17 years old and i think i am having one now. I told my mom and she sent me to dominion, for those who have not heard of dominion hospital it is an awful place full of awful people. Anyways when i was there i shared with the doctors what was going on in my head as best as i could and when i told them i was smoking weed (i quit b/c it made my delusions and hallucinations worse) they focused only on that and told me that i caused my psychosis myself. This made my furious because i told them that i have had these voices and hallucinations for as long as i can remember but they told me i was a drug addict and sent me to rehab. They didn't listen to me at all. They left me alone to deal with the taunting going on inside my head by myself. So anyways in the end i was away from home for 3 weeks before, luckily, i got pulled from rehab by my insurance because they didn't see a reason for me to be there. When i got out my mom got me an appointment with the psychiatrist that i dealt with in dominion that told me i was a druggie and that it was all my fault that i am the way i am. So when i got to his office i asked to be put on different medicine because he had put me on seriquil and it gave me horrible anxiety and i had read online that you should not have anxiety on seriquil because that was bad. So when i told him this he told me that it wasnt the type of anxiety that I was having and that i was to stay on the medicine. A little side note, this man had spend a total of 10 minutes with me in dominion and a total of 5 minutes with me in his office and i had not explained the type of anxiety that i was feeling. In response to what he said to me i got upset and told him that i had read of many websites that anxiety on that medicine was bad for you and that he had not even asked me or let me explain the type of anxiety i was having. After i said this he got offended and told me that it is not my place to tell him how to do his job (which i was not i was sharing my concern for my health) and he kicked me out of his office telling my mom that he would no longer have me as a patient because i was demanding and ridiculous (this i do not understand because i was being completely polite). As the days go on my voices and delusions become worse. i feel that people are always watching me and monitoring what i am doing. i feel like someone is out  to kill me and when i close my eyes i see figures in my eyelids. occasionally when i close my eyes i feel as if someone is shaking me and i become extremely dizzy and lightheaded. i am not diagnosed at all, but my mother is a behavior analysis so i got papers from her on schizophrenia and related disorders and my boyfriend and i feel as though i fit the criteria for schizophrenia but no one will listen! they (my voices) taunt me. they tell me im faking it and that i just want attention but why would i fake something that makes me scared and feel terrible and anxious? if i could stop this i would but they just keep saying im faking! they told me theyre plan is working but they wont tell me the plan. ITS MY BODY TOO I WANT TO KNOW THE PLAN! what do they have planned? is it bad? it probably is they are douche bags. they say the police are investigating me but why would the police investigate me i have no record and i dont do anything illegal. they try to have conversations with me and they try to argue with me on everything. my boyfriend tells me to not engage with them but he doesnt know how hard that is. they fight with each other sometimes. its crazy to listen to. i just dont know whats real and whats not real anymore. i dont know if its me thinking or if its them talking. life is getting harder to deal with now. i am living a nightmare. they say i will never get help and that i will die. why do they hate me so much. please dont leave hateful comments i really dont need that. thank you for letting me share. i know this post is dumb but thank you for letting me get this all off my chest.

I started seeing a therapist last night. I'm going to be working closely with her and a psychiatrist. 

I decided I wanted to try an experiment and see where my baseline currently is in terms of symptoms. 

I've decided to wean myself off medication and see how I do. If I become symptomatic again, I will immediately start taking the medication again. 

Should I not become symptomatic again, I will continue to see a psychiatrist until I am symptom free for at least a year, possibly longer. Then I will probably continue to be monitored by a GP who I can see a lot faster than a psychiatrist should symptoms return.  

I had my first medication free night, so far so good. I used to be symptomatic again the day after not taking my medication. I haven't really skipped a dose in a couple years, so I don't know where that stands. 

I'm really excited for this! And I realize it's my first day off medication, but I'm completely fine right now and this gives me high hopes! The medication had caused a lot of side effects. Including drug induced Parkinson's, tardive dyskinesia,  a lot of weight gain,  and neutropenia (which has in turn caused me to get meningitis and pneumonia). 

It'd also be nice not to be so dependent on a pill. 

Sorry for the long winded post, but I'm just so excited! Here I am, laying in complete darkness, not having taken my medication, with no symptoms! I'm so happy!

Not that they were kind voices, they were suffering. But I think the fact that I can't hear them now just means they're still suffering but unable to communicate because the medication is blocking my ability to hear them. 

I was so important to them. So important. And now I'm nothing. Now I'm absolutely nothing and that's not who I'm meant to be. I'm meant to be a savior of so many lives from another dimension. 

Last week, at least I think it was last week, I saw a woman in my room. A whole, real, non-transparent at all woman. She communicated with me. i think the lack of words from me to my voices in another dimension is getting to them so they sent someone to me to see why I wasn't going to be their savior anymore.

I feel fine, though. I feel like.. I can be ok off meds. I don't know what to believe about my ""delusions"" though.. but I'm doing fine. 

Maybe it is all the meds. But I've just read that the meds cause more brain damage than having schizophrenia. So maybe it's better that i stop now anyways?

I keep thinking ""I have to save them."" I don't want to be sick. Maybe I never was? Why do I have to be so wrong? I wish my delusions were just that. That'd mean no one in another dimension is being hurt but I remember hearing them so clearly. Their cries for help. It meant more than anything that I saved them. Even if that meant killing myself to go to another dimension.

I took my meds tonight. But I'm thinking maybe tomorrow I don't. I know what my therapist would say. He'd tell me it's all wrong. That the meds are the reason I'm so normal now and doing well. During our last session we talked about this and he said I'd struggle for a couple of weeks and then get hospitalized. :/

I really would rather not get hospitalized since I have a pretty cool internship starting up later this month. I'd rather be normal. And it sounds like meds are the way but what if they're not? What if they're really doing more harm than good and what if they're blocking my voices from getting to me in a way that is part of reality? Meaning that the voices are real and the meds are destructing my ability to listen to them.

I want to go off my meds. But I'm so torn about it. Tell me, have you guys heard about meds causing more brain damage than schizophrenia itself? Do you think we can be well without medication if we try harder? I keep on thinking I just need to try harder this time to stay in society and not get hospitalized. It's just up to me and my ability to hold myself together. 

I don't even know what I'm saying. maybe I'm already getting sick and I just need a meds adjustment. Frak. I don't know what to do. ","['pobj', 'compound']",-1,neu_vader

If so, how do you cope, and what medicines or alternative methods have worked for you? Risperdal, Haldol, and Abilify do not help me with my illness. I actually experience paradoxical effects that worsen my condition and make me more disabled. Should I wait until there are better medications? Should I try clozaril (clozapine)? I know a lot of people are hopeful for CBD-based medicines. It's been three years and I really want to move on with my life. I would love to try TMS or any variant but the cost and availability of such treatment makes this out of my reach. Has TMS worked for anyone? 

It's not fair. I guess I should be grateful that I don't hallucinate. But that doesn't mean I'm not suffering or being tortured by my mind. Hell, maybe I don't have schizophrenia, but if I really do have it, it would make a lot of sense. I feel like the biggest reason why I can't function at all in society is the delusional thoughts that make me paranoid as well as the terrifying derealization that makes me feel cut off from reality. The second most disabling aspect is the cognitive decline from the illness and medicine that makes me feel that I can't go back to school. 

The good news is I'm starting to experience pleasure again, I am getting more moments of clarity as time progresses, and I'm losing weight. 

I really wish you could do the whole mind over matter thing, but it is impossible; you can't flip a switch. I never felt disabled in my life until my psychotic break. I was on the top of the world.

My therapist calls them ""seductive"". 

They tell me I'm a God and I just know it's true. No one here understands. 

I've been thinking none of this is real anyways. That I'm the only real person. I'm probably trapped in a dimension of my own all alone and I've made all these fake people to keep it interesting.

Am I having an episode? I can see how it might be, but I don't feel too bad. I feel ok. I'm a God, the savior of a dimension.

But I feel like the demon hurting the people in the other dimension is in this dimension, too, not in physical form, but always watching me, like a spirit. And the people in my sober living home are spies reporting to people who report to him about me because I can't kill myself, or else I'd go to the other dimension and stop/hurt him.

I don't know what to do. 

Is this an episode? I don't want it to be. But I just, I KNOW I'm the savior. I've heard it enough from the voices.

I feel so bad for them, I just want to save them. I'm hearing them now with their ""Save me"" 's and such.

I feel really suicidal. Not because things are bad lately, though they are with bad friends and such, but because I have to go to the other dimension to save the people. 

Just needed to get this out. i've been thinking about going to the wife of the demon's house and threatening her.. just to demand that she tell me where he is in this dimension so I can kill him. 

I have a file on him, is that crazy? He was a person in this dimension, like with a physical body but he died here and went to the other dimension because he was always evil. 

I have these options, I think:

Though the Cabal may or may not have it out for me any more than it does any other person, that doesn't change the fact that it targets EVERYONE! The end result is that this whole idea is trying to take me over, and it's freaky as hell because I'm mildly avolitic half the time (which isn't all blameable on Prodromal-Whatever, there's other shit going on too that can explain it) which is really just its influence. I can't let it take me over, because I want to accomplish greatness and be the person I know I can be; I have to *work on my art*, as I say so often, continue writing scripts and turn them into movies, continue associating with people and making plans with them to get the hell out of Dodge and be artist kids with dreams somewhere where we can fulfill them. (I'm damn glad I met Chris. The guy is like a perspective flip of me. I can't wait until we see each other again on Friday.)

So the problem here, so to speak, is that I am trapped within a world I should not be in. I am intensely disconnected. I can't figure out how to flee the Cabal, and learn how to help others out of ruts and vicious cycles and the daily grind, if I can't fucking do shit. Did I draw a bad hand? I'm probably mild in both positive and negative symptoms if you really break it down, but the latter feel worse than the former, which doesn't seem to be common at all. My ex, who is STPD-diagnosed, actually says my delusions are pretty serious, and I suppose they've gotten serious before (""Don't walk on the sidewalk! Only Cabalists do what they're told to do! YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISKS BECAUSE IF YOU DO NOT TAKE RISKS YOU WILL FALL INTO MEDIOCRICY""), but I've always been able to talk myself down from those things, mainly by splitting up my mental state a bit and getting into arguments with myself over whether I need to follow this exact bit of anti-Cabalist doctrine. It's quite amusing, 10/10 would recommend as way to talk yourself out of attempting to walk down the middle of the road.

I'm getting sidetracked. All apologies. This post is 100% stream of consciousness.

Anyway, if I were to get myself back to a point, as I mentioned my ex is STPD-diagnosed, and I've probably had STPD my whole life. I definitely fit the symptom profile from a young age. I'm autistic too, so that complicates it, but there's a deviation between autistic traits and STPD traits and I had several that fell on the other side of the line. He believes that I've progressed from there, though, and that my current symptom profile fits the one for schizophrenia. I disagree with him, because I'm not like most schizophrenics in my presentation. I'm pretty functional for someone who will corner you yelling about how you're all being shorn down to shape by society's mould if given the opportunity -- mainly because I never have the opportunity! There's probably something in there, isn't there? But anyway, the whole thing I've been trying to talk about is hallucinations and the general disconnect from reality. I don't feel like I'm disconnected from reality, I feel like I'm too connected. I'm probably further from it than your average person, but, you know, there are layers of reality, and I'm trying to transcend them. I'm trying to be *better* than your average person, THAT'S THE POINT. I need to be aware of everything and know everything. I'm extremely intelligent by nature and I can't waste that -- I have to have *everything*. I need to just go on the road and drive across America and watch the world sing as the stars dance.

(skip over the next three paragraphs if you don't want to read a boring background story)

After a while, I learned a moderate and appropriate amount of social skills, so I began to branch out and meet new people. Out of these of course were your occasional pot heads and along with them perhaps two people who messed with harder drugs. I got along with that crowd since they were a little more strung out and weird than I was, and I didn't feel so judged.

I had of course smoked a few joints in the past couple of years, but I guess I never truly felt high because I didn't inhale right. I supposed at the time that weed was just something people smoked to look cool, kind of like cigarettes. I would never decline an offer but wouldn't really take a huge puff.

But I did experiment with harsher drugs. I tried alcohol, ecstasy, and oxycotton. I promised myself I'd never try anything more than once, but of course, like most people I soon learned, I wanted to know what drugs did what. There were so many to try and it was as exciting as a child opening a new toy on Christmas.

But on the night I took ecstasy for the first time, something terrible happened. It was some guy's birthday party, so everyone was passing around like 5 blunts and hotboxing in a huge room. I joined in the festivity, not expecting much, while also rolling. I soon started to feel a buzz though, which was new to me, and decided to continue smoking. (Truth be told the X only made me numb, it was probably just adderal. There was no euphoria or anything.) Soon some older guy pulled out a bong and gave me some medical MJ to toke on. That did it. After the first hit I was gone.

The walls were vibrating. Colors were tones of rainbows. The ceiling fan was the meaning of life, like God, I couldn't stop staring. I saw the silhouette of a man flying over me which I thought was Jesus (I wasn't even a Christian at the time). It was incredible. I had never felt so good in my life.

I sat there for 3 hours just shouting ""WOAH! WHAT THE FUCK! HOLY SHIT!"" Guys were telling me to calm down. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I was just frozen. I couldnt move. I had reached cloud 9.

After that night I smoked weed every day for 3 months. I kept trying to chase that dragon. I found it a couple of times, but in the meantime I was becoming very stupid. I got my mother in trouble with the law for smoking with me (I couldn't keep my big mouth shut) I lost all my friends for acting retarded, and I ended up screwing my life over.

So I quit. I also noticed my tolerance level was boosted so high that smoking hardly did anything to me anymore (I was 17 still with a medical MJ card).

After stopping cold turkey my old negative thoughts returned to my skull. Ones I hadn't heard in years. ""Life is meaningless. I'm in so much pain. I'm a waste of space. Everyone hates me. I should die.""

But a new thought I never truly considered approached my surroundings.

""I should kill myself.""

So since I was going through withdrawals (cold sweats, loss of appetite, unable to sleep, and not in my right mind) I was like sure, fuck it. I've been wanting to for a while anyway.

So I did the stupidest thing ever. I grabbed a plastic bag, took a walk in the forest behind my house, and tried to suffocate myself. Of course it didn't work, so I told my mom what happened, and we both agreed she should drive me to a mental hospital.

I arrived at 6:30 after a night of no sleep, and said a bunch of stuff I don't remember. Apparently it was so out there that I didn't even need an inspection, they sent me to the children's ward right away.

That first night was scary. I was having night terrors and I couldn't fall asleep. Food and water made me calm down though, I was really manic, and one of the workers there was really nice, and gladly gave me whatever I asked for. However, after the 3am staff change, the new one refused to give me more than two cups of water. This freaked me out for some reason, I guess I had horrible cotton mouth, so I went to the restroom to drink from the faucet. However this disturbed the worker greatly and she refused to let me return henceforth again.
After that night the nurses all started to get annoyed with me because I wouldn't shut up, so they tried to force me to take medications. I refused because I believed they were unnatural toxic chemicals that made humans devolve into primates. This sounds so crazy as I'm typing but I really believed a bunch of weird stuff I had never even heard of before. It's like something was speaking to me. Apparently it made so much sense that the other residents there took my side and started refusing their medications. This was terrible because the staff eventually had to shoot one of the girls up. I had never seen such a horrible turn of events. Three adults kneeing a little girl to the ground while stabbing her with a needle. Her screams were like no sound I had ever heard before. I guess this is what started my paranoia.

I eventually started to believe the staff were evil and wanted us dead. At night I'd hear similar blood-curdling screams and the next day I noticed some kids were missing. I suppose now they had left but my first initial reaction was ""holy crap, they torture people to death here.""
What made this so obvious to me was the fact that they were doing construction in a hall way. It was the perfect set up. They could do whatever they wanted, be as messy as heck, because there were mats around the room, to stop from the blood from staining the floors. No one would be the wiser. Only I and some other kids who knew how to keep quiet knew about the horrible secret. These people were so twisted and cruel they snuffed the brats they hated for fun. Oh my freaking goodness I was going to die. I was going to die.

No one believed me. Is my mom in on it? Does she WANT ME GONE? Is she sick of me? Or are they going to torture her too? OH MY GOSH I BETTER CALL HER AND WARN HER NOT TO VISIT ME. THESE DRUGS THEY'RE GIVING ME ARE KILLING MY ADRENALINE SO MY PAIN TOLERANCE WILL BE LOWER. WHAT IF THEY KEEP ME ALIVE BECAUSE THEY HATE ME SO MUCH? WHAT IF THE REST OF MY LIFE CONSISTS OF BEING STATIONED IN SOME KIND OF ROOM WHERE THEY KEEP PEOPLE THEY HATE ALIVE, BUT ALSO COMPLETELY DISCOMBOBULATED? IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

I specifically remember sitting in a room while people voted on what procedure to take my life they were going to carry out. There were two options. A rooster crow or a cyclopian eye. One was peeling my face's skin so it flapped over, and one where they plucked out my eye and pasted it to my forehead. It's a very clear and vivid picture in my head. They even let me vote. The kids participated too. One girl told a staff she couldn't deal with it, thought it was wrong, and was going to need therapy afterwards. The guy told her ""once someone snaps, you never go back.""

They were probably setting the whole thing up to scare me or freak me out, or maybe I just hallucinated the whole thing, but damn. That was seriously the scariest thing I had ever gone through. I was living in a horror movie. I was trapped in a white roomed cell waiting for the most horrible thing imaginable to happen. Waiting.. persevering my last precious moments of breath and life without immense physical pain.. waiting.. when are they going to take action?

I tried to kill myself by drinking too much water while taking a shower (I just ended up throwing up) and suffocating myself again. I wanted to take my life before they could. It was hell. Literally. I was so scared out of my mind. I had never experienced terror like that in my entire life.

You see I don't know how to put this. But as time comes to pass I chose not to take meds. I am not saying don't, I am no expert. But you see life has a lot of shit. A lot of bad. A lot of good. Now what I am trying to say here is this.


If the world was all good. Everyone would be confused zombies walking in circles unknown to themselves and the world around them. If it was all evil we wouldn't be alive goddamnit. But you see it's both. It has to be a balance. Without both existing simultaneously we wouldn't be able to identify greatness. We wouldn't be able to have a drive to understand more and discover ourselves and go to the fucking moon.


And when the balance tips, evil takes over the good will the next few years. (MLK, Ghandi, etc) and when there's too much good the bad will take over. Get used it. It's life man. A murderer will find killing people good and not bad. But the majority finds it the opposite so they will win keeping the balance in place. It's life.


Now why say all this useless crap. I say it because to embrace who you are. You see faith is a weird thing. You have to go through years of pain. Years of it. Then one day look back and say, ""it was all meant to be."" 


This your faith. Most brilliant men who have lived on this pale blue dot where schizophrenic. And my god there are more to come.

The main facts of my situation:

1. A relative of mine has some sort of disorder, which I believe to be schizophrenia because her father was diagnosed with it around the same age as her. I could be totally wrong about it being schizophrenia, it was what her therapist years ago hinted at though and the symptoms seem to line up but she tries to hide them for the most part.
2. Her most prominent symptom is extreme paranoia and delusions of persecution. She believes that there is a plot to make her seem crazy in order to steal from her and take away her legal rights.
3. She has bad physical symptoms now (as a result of an untreated disease that we know about) and refuses to go to the doctor. 

At some point soon, based on the her words and actions, I believe she will qualify as someone that could be involuntarily treated (she used to be good at hiding her symptoms but I think it's gotten bad enough that if someone spent a couple hours with her it wouldn't be possible). 

The thing is, the involuntary commitment plays into her fears so much that I'm worried. And I don't know how these medications work. I find it hard to imagine that her delusions that have been the dominant part of her life for years now will just be resolved by medications. Is it expected that they will they go away and she will be able to think more logically? I feel like with the thought patterns of paranoia and persecution would still be around and she would get off the medicine ASAP. 

Anyone (as either a patient or a family member) have any experience with how to deal with paranoia and maintaining treatment (which would have to originate involuntarily)? I don't think there is any relative that can take care of her and make sure she sticks to treatment and I can't really afford to have someone continually check on her any time soon. Is there any point to involuntary commitment then or will it just alienate her from the rest of her family even more?

would you spare a minute to read this wall of text. I don't know how to help my brother. My [brother [M43] was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 25. Since then he's been in and out of state hospitals across a few different states. He's lived near me at his current location, a lightly supervised housing complex, for the past three years which has also been the longest stretch in over a decade that he's managed to stay on his meds and out of a forced visit to the state hospital. That said, he hates where he's living and is desperate to move, believing this whole idea of him having schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder has been a lifelong gaslighting plot against him. He refuses to work with case workers or psychologists and only takes his current meds because he's under the impression he has to, and won't accept any dosage increases or changes. To me, it appears he has been hanging out in a kind of medium-grade psychosis for the past couple years, definitely shows disorganized thinking and speech, hears voices, attributing them to radio waves being directed at him from a nearby police station, and often verbalizes what to me are paranoid delusions involving the government and the psychological community plotting against him. He deeply mistrusts anyone involved in psychology in any way. I believe he needs a lot more help than he will accept and he can't be forced to get help until he becomes ""a danger to himself or others"" which it hasn't come to yet. So he wants to move out of state to get away from his current ""nexus of evil"" housing that he now associates with all of these negative thoughts and symptoms he's had. Historically he's agitated to move after about after a year of living in any given location. Since he doesn't think he needs any help or supervision and responds angrily at any suggestion that he does, I'm not sure what to tell him when he asks me ""what are the conditions of my release?"". Legally he's under no obligation to stay where he's at. I'm his payee for his SSDI, though, so if he's going to move he'll need my help, but I see no better living scenario for him. If he lives on his own, he'll likely quit his meds and end up hospitalized again, and since anywhere he lives will have the typical noises of every day living that will eventually become voices to him, in a year if he's not hospitalized, he'll be desperate to move again with the same urgency that he feels now. My question for you: If my brother lacks insight into his symptoms and condition, how can I effectively tell him that the reason he's living where he is is because of his symptoms and condition? How do I weigh the moral obligation to respect his wishes and autonomy against the moral obligation to keep him, my brother, from ending up homeless, back in the state hospital under possibly traumatic circumstances (last time he was tazed multiple times by police and hauled off), or worse? Do I just let him hit rock bottom whatever that entails? I feel too close to the issue to see clearly and could really use your insight, those of you still reading. Thanks.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

* Based on research studies, I have a lot of the factors that lead to schizophrenia (born in winter, single-parent family, abuse, male, etc). In fact, I have a ~200% higher chance of developing schizophrenia than your average person. 

* I've got a documented family history of schizophrenia that I was unaware of until eight months ago. Luckily, my history is in a European country so I'm safe in the U.S. 

* I wrote down a lot of symptoms in my blog two years ago, before I knew of the exact symptoms of schizophrenia. When I learned about the symptoms in class, well, they matched perfectly. And I'm not a hypochondriac

After having in 2007  a major psychotic break and hallucinating a lot, I realised that I have something wrong. So in late 2008, I went on my meds. I chose my own dosage and decided to stick to it. Over the next months and years symptoms would disappear and I would have a full time career as a software engineer.

This went on from 2008 until 2013. At the start of this period I met my current psychiatrist who told me that normally people take anti-psychotics for about 5 years. So in 2013 as I visited him I told him that the five years were more than up and that maybe it was time to stop the medicine. He was reluctant and over several sessions he finally agreed. He had told me that there was some risk that I would relapse. But I didn’t care. I wanted to stop taking meds. I had tested with high blood sugar on the limit of being pre-diabetic and I feared diabetes.

So in the middle of 2013, I stopped taking meds. I first thought that I took control of my life. Little did I know that I was about to lose control. In the beginning of 2014, I went crazy, lost the job I had held in a good company (I left the company myself) and I started behaving like a nut thus losing the respect of people I had known. 

A couple of months later I went back on medication. My parents started giving me the medication mixed with orange juice without my knowledge. I discovered this, threw the medicine away. Then it hit me, I had gone insane. I was sick. I wasn’t cured from schizophrenia. Schizophrenia was not a false diagnosis. I had stopped my meds and went nuts. The same realisation that hit me in 2014, had hit me in 2008. Back then I had hallucinated, so it was clear that i went nuts. This time my delusions were more nuanced, but it was clear. I had lost control.

So like I had did in 2008, I went back to the dose of medication I had taken back then. I went back to see my doctor. We decided to stay with it.

6 months later, I would visit him. I still took this dose I was ok. I was leading a new job in software development. In many ways better than the old one.

Now working for about a year. Sane for about a year. I plan to go to school at the end of the year and get an MBA. I am healthy. I am active. I am sane. I have control back again of myself and my life.

I feel so alone. So out of it. Like the meds are making me less human. Schizophrenia is human. It's ok to feel things and experience scary things because it's part of the human experience. Maybe symptoms are ok? 

I wonder if I should quit meds and just.. let myself be. It may be scary, but maybe I'm meant to experience the fear, anxiety and horror?

I've been thinking about why i have schizophrenia. And I think, well, no matter why, I'm meant to have it. I keep thinking my voice really are people from another dimension trying to reach out to me. is that symptomatic of me? I keep getting the feeling that all I've had to deal with can't have been for nothing. That it has to all mean something, it doesn't mean what you think but it means something.

Like, what if they really were people? I feel so stupid for thinking otherwise. Of course they're people. I HEARD them. I felt them. I feared for them. 

Maybe the reason I'm so disconnected is because I've disconnected myself from the people that really need me?

And I've been feeling a bit suicidal lately. I keep thinking about it, because that's what my voices always needed me to do. So I keep thinking I have to find them and save them and I have to do that by killing myself. 

My mom's going on vacation for a week or so which leaves me home alone for all that time. She's worried I'm going to hurt myself or get hospitalized.

So I'm going to drown myself in art the entire time to keep things under control. Create all the things. 

I don't know. I feel broken. I'm worried I'm going to hurt myself, too. ",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

I'm a 22 year old female who is quite functional in society despite having stuff wrong with me. I went to a psychologist and psychiatrist for a while and I was diagnosed with general anxiety, OCD, and depression. This was a couple years ago. I've been taking Xanax daily for over 2 years to help with anxiety and to make me feel not so on edge and overly perceptive.

For a long time I've thought I had schizophrenia. I didn't bring up a lot of the reasons why with the psychologist. I know what they do to people who have it and I'm not interested in those medications for now. I can function normally, go to college, maintain relationships, etc. But there are a lot of bizarre things going on in my head.

One of my worst OCD symptoms is intrusive thoughts, and mine are horrible. Pretty much every time I talk to a human I have them. They're completely vulgar and often violent. When I converse with someone I'll see them bleeding out. I'll see them in great distress. I won't go into detail because nothing you say is a secret on the internet. But I see horrible things happen to them, even people I love. I touch a human neck lovingly and think of slitting the vein.

I have many visions of violence, but also of good things. I spend an excessive amount of time daydreaming and I'm withdrawn from reality. I like to sit alone for a long time and think. I get very obsessed with fictional characters or dead people and idealize them. 

I'm prone to bouts of paranoia against people I love. A while ago I was genuinely scared my boyfriend was going to strangle and kill me. I felt desperate to get out of the house and I really thought he was crazy and was going to have me dead in an hour. I even said it to him and he just laughed at me. It's happened a few other times with him too.

I'm really tired of seeing horrible things when I speak to people. I don't want to think of them hurting. I feel like an empath who has lived a thousand lives. I don't really care about anything. Everything seems so sad and meaningless. I feel I can see the world for what it is, and it's depressing.

I've only found pleasure in fantasy: I believe dreams are a gateway to another world, and I go back to my dream life every night and communicate with people from another dimension where identity doesn't matter.

Do you think any of this is significant if it doesn't impact my life? I think I've suffered from hallucinations my whole life and just learned to adapt to it. I remember laying on the couch as a kid and having full-blown all-immersive delusions play out in front of my eyes. Like watching a movie with your eyes closed. I always just thought it was imagination. 

Do you think I have schizophrenia or I'm just a weird person with too much time on their hands? 

I recognize a lot of my thoughts are outlandish but I still believe them. I know others will judge me and I can usually tell if something is ""normal behavior"" or wacky.

I was reading something about schizophrenia the other day and going over the symptoms, short of the serious hallucinations and most of the internal monologue symptoms I do score on online tests as highly predisposed to schizophrenia.

Symptoms I have that I didn't think were related (but could also be stress or depression)
- disorganised thought and speech
- sometimes laughing at a thought completely unrelated to the situation
- loss of vocabulary, inability to remember items (short or long term)
- mixing up letters or not finishing them while writing and deterioration of spelling (I used to be fantastic, now I can't even get your/you're and to/too/two straight)
- lack of motivation
- emotional flattening (I watched a movie last night that normally makes me bawl my eyes out... instead I was bored).
- procrastination via distraction. I sit down to send someone and email and suddenly I've spent 5 hours on reddit. I close the page, tell myself I'm going to start my homework or clean the house... and before I know it I'm doing something else to kill time.

Classic symptoms that I do fit, but not very well:
- Paranoia
From when I was a kid I was convinced adults could read my mind. I grew up, found out that being an adult doesn't turn you into a mind reader. Now the fantasy is that everyone can read minds and it's some big Truman Show type conspiracy.

I also am often certain that when people are laughing or whispering it's about me (even when logically I know neither of these are true).

I spent a good chunk of time during the summer terrified I was going to get murdered at any turn. Some guy say behind me on the bus and I was convinced in my feelings that he was going to pull a gun out of his bag and shoot me in the back of the head. Even though logically I knew it wasn't a reasonable fear I still couldn't relax for the full bus route.

I've got other irrationally strong fears and I can't logic my way out of any of them.


Symptoms that may or may not be schizophrenic/schizotypal (because I'm not an expert):
- Apathy.
- Very violent intrusive thoughts. Somebody poked the button on my bookbag at university today and said ""boop"" and instantly my brain flashed the idea of violently punching him in the face. At work I find some of my coworkers also illicit similar feelings in me for things that at other times wouldn't bother me.
- I do have a history of anxiety and depression, which do share some symptoms but this feels different. I'm also not currently on any meds and when I was given a low-dose anti-psychotic (Quetiapine) instead of anti-depressants I felt best but the weight gain was brutal.

What of these symptoms are tells that I'm probably overthinking this or that something else is wrong?

TL;DR: I'm probably just a hypochondriac.",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

So like the title says, I feel overwhelmed, I need a break. I'm trying to be strong, I've been strong for years but I feel like my strength is running out. When I was first diagnosed I was in a horrible psychotic episode, it was the run of the mill persecution stuff that's common in schizophrenia. I got on meds and things got better. For the most part. 

But its four years later and now I feel like I'm running out of steam. I feel overwhelmed by having to constantly deal with my paranoia. Its stressing me out big time and I really have a hard time convincing myself these things aren't real. My ""support system"" is no help they just ask me ""are you taking your medication?"" I'm really all alone in this. Like they dont even visit when things are bad. 

The paranoia is always there now everyday while I'm at work, shopping, walking, or taking the bus and I can't escape it. For months, since its been back, I just let it roll off my back. Just put it to the back of my mind and that's where it stayed. But in times like now its like all the memories of things that happened or that I think happened come rushing back. The memories of my family, friends, and mental health professionals questioning my judgment even when I'm well jump to the front of my mind. It makes me feel alone and like I can't hack life.

I feel beaten down and weak. I just want to give up. I have nobody I can truly rely on and its taking its toll on me. I just needed to get this off my chest.","['pobj', 'dobj']",-1,neu_vader

I'm a 30yr old female, newly diagnosed with schizophrenia but my symptoms are ~20yrs old. My fiance and therapist are noticing my memory is shot and over the weeks is degrading in a hurry. Therapist wants me to be evaluated for early onset dementia and to get another scan done, to make sure I don't have something like a tumor since I'm having trouble focusing my eyes and getting headaches and such. That evaluation happens on Tuesday for me.

I've been so cloudy lately and I don't feel like myself at all, it's like cotton in my forehead, the thinking part. Does anyone experience this, especially when you get the ""thought blocking"" and all your thoughts stop &amp; you cant get them started again? I will be in the middle of a sentence and just stop talking, train of thought totally gone and no amount of someone trying to assist me will do any good. In those moments I can't even articulate that I am upset with my inability to continue. I was almost getting used to the blocked thoughts phenomena, taking a ""let it go"" stance and trying not to let it bother me, but now it makes my head feel weird, like it is heating up and overstuffed, the pressure is terrible. Does anyone else get instant headaches when this happens? I'm almost becoming scared that this is a tumor or something in addition. Like I said, I've had the hallucinations and delusions and such for a looong time, but this stuff is new. Yesterday I forgot how to wash my hair, standing in the shower staring at the shampoo bottle and thinking ""Important. I need that thing"". I remembered later on in the afternoon...this just really sucks. My last scans were last year, it showed nothing abnormal at all, no seizures, no tumors, nothing. I have lesions on my spinal cord from what they call ""possible MS"" but nothing on the brain. I need to get to the bottom of this in a hurry, it feels serious, or perhaps I am just anxious as ever because you only get one brain and its kinda necessary that it works...

My goal is to not get 302'd so I must appear as calm as I can in front of the doc on Tuesday. I value my freedom and independence above all else, hospitals are equal to prisons in my mind, a total lack of control and autonomy but they do serve an important purpose and I'm not going to bash that. I am safe, I will not hurt myself or anyone else. I just want to get better. I think this means trying meds again and becoming the zombie again, the zombie who still hallucinates... have to give it a shot I guess even though between my heart conditions and reactions/allergies it is really a dangerous thing. I think I will start seeing my therapist twice a week now, one hour just isn't enough time.

  I have so many questions and I don't expect an answer to any of it, not even some of it. I'm just so glad that I found people who operate on my wavelength; whether you call that a blessing or whatever, I think it's great and I appreciate reading all of your stories, so thank you. I am pretty confident I won't be judged here and I needed to vent this out...my world is getting small as I find myself isolating out of fear and pride, so this is freeing. Again, thanks :) This took close to 4 hours to write, it is such a struggle anymore..hell, I'm 30, not 130, you know? This isn't right. 

TL;DR,  I go to see a doctor because my brain broke, and you are all superstars and I appreciate you.

To start this off it began when I smoked weed back my senior year of high school. I smoked and was twitching and extremely happy unlike the other people, who smoked but they were completely find with it. I smoked occasionally, but everything was fine. When I got to college I switched to smoking like 6 times a day, I was still doing the twitching and looked extremely happy and was very energetic. Everyone would always think I was on cocaine or something. I was completely coherent. I could run a straight line etc...

Eventually I started to become paranoid that everyone around was watching me. I thought this was real at the time because well I was always the dude, who was extremely happy on weed. As this feeling got worse and worse I completely stopped smoking, but the paranoia stayed with me sober, so I decided to talk to my mother. I go to her and start crying and tell her I think i'm schizophrenic because my grandma has schizophrenia. She says I seem completely fine, but takes me to the general practitioner. I explain blatantly to them I think i'm schizophrenic and that I was feeling paranoid. My mom was with us and she reacted kinda badly to me straight up saying this to the doctor. She told me to let the doctor figure out what's wrong. Thinking back to this I realize why she reacted so bad...My grandma has paranoid schizophrenia and when she's off her medicine she really does start doing some bat shit crazy stuff, but here I was calmly explaining to the doctor that I thought I was schizophrenic.

I'm going to explain some of my paranoia here. I thought the radio was talking to me. I thought my friends were doing movements that contained hidden codes. I thought the television was sending secret messages. I did not believe any of this. I was hearing voices, but this is hard to explain. I knew the voices weren't random it was like I was taking background noise or people's voices and making it something else to make me paranoid. I knew it was all impossible, and I really didn't want anyone to find out I was like this, so that's why I went to mom.

The general practitioner then takes us to the behavioral health doctor, and I start crying here and tell her ""I don't want anyone to think I'm crazy"". She says she wants me to be hospitalized, and I agree. I'm thinking oh god..I am going crazy..this is really serious...now everyone at school is going to find out. My mom is with us and since I'm agreeing and i'm so calm and everything she says it's okay and I'll take the medicine at home.

They gave me resperidone. I start taking it everyday like i'm supposed to for an entire year and a half, but this shit ruins my life. I fail all my classes, stop talking to friends, gain 60 pounds, and I can't get out of bed anymore. I'm tired and depressed all the time. The paranoia went away after the first month too. I haven't even told my mom about failing so many classes...fuck...

Eventually I decide to stop this. I'll stop taking the medicine and if I hear and voices or get paranoid I'll start it again immediately. Well...I stop the medicine and it's been 3 years, and I've been completely fine.No paranoia no more delusions. A few months later I started Keto and lost 50 pounds and I have a 4.0 GPA from then on. A few months after that I realize I'm tired of being anti-social and depressed and I want more friends to talk to. I've been living at home going to school since starting the medicine. So I go to the original doctor with a list of symptoms I've been having because I'm looking for help and want to get better. The entire list is anxiety symptoms like unable to focus on anything but eye contact and panic attacks when going to parties. She diagnoses me with anxiety and takes psychosis off my chart since I've have not had an anti psychotic in forever. She also tells me to go out and try to make friends, and gives me for Xanax for emergencies.

Well... that same day listening to the doctor. I go onto a depression/anxiety forum and make friends with the girl. We'll call her Amanda. Amanda and I text constantly, because we both seem so similar. And I'm taking like a 2 page word document of text back and forth a couple times a day for like a week. Then she just stops hitting me back out of nowhere. I really don't take this well. Then the following day I have to go to this huge social event and I think I had a panic attack. I come home and immediately get in bed thinking about how badly I want to kill myself because I can't just socialize normally. I've never felt this depressed and I spend 20 minutes crying too hard to log into reddit to post a suicidewatch. Eventually that night...I skype my friend and start to feel better. She suggests I start journaling, which I do and it makes me feel a lot better.

It's at this point the next day I think I start being hypo maniac. I start switching moods rapidly. I stop eating right. I stop showering regularly. I go on a huge shopping spree with my credit card. I talk a lot more very fast, and i'm very impulsive. I get extremely close to hiring a hooker. I'm sleeping an hour a night. I get really tired in a depressive state and have some hypnagogic hallucinations. I get worried and make an emergency appointment with a doctor. I go there and explain everything. I not only explain what happened. I make a calendar with the exact dates and times I have every single symptom also detailing what happened with Amanda. I even recorded how I felt in the moods in my journal so she could see what they were like. Yes, I watch my health really close and i'm a really OCD person. I was never psychotic, delusional, or thought about hurting others. I actually felt kinda better because my anxiety was gone. 

The doctor, who knows my grandma has schizophrenia, says that I have schizophrenia and wants me hospitalized and wants to start me back on resperidone. This really hurt me and I started crying in the office, which probably made things worse. I was thinking about how much better everything has gotten since I stopped the medicine. I hadn't done anything crazy. I was watching my health very close. I didn't have the paranoid thoughts from 3 years ago or any delusions. I agreed to just take the medicine and go home, later that day the mood swings have completely stopped and I'm back to my normal depressed sarcastic self. This event with Amanda to now happened over less than two weeks.

I have the medicine with me, but I'm unsure if I should start taking it again? Also does it sound like I have schizophrenia?

My mom was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder about 15 years ago, give or take a few years (I was a pre-teen, so the exact year has kind of slipped past me). She medicated herself before that with a lot of drinking - I mean, a lot. Over the years, she saw a psychiatrist (who she saw for at least ten years before stopping, but recently just started seeing again) and has been on many different kinds of medications including Lithium, Topamax, Ambien, Seroquel, Lamictal, and Depakote. I'm sure there are others, but those are the ones that I can think of off the top of my head.

She had her up and down days, just like most people suffering from Bipolar have. She was on a good streak for a while - one of her meds was working really well and she seemed to be as close to normal as I had seen her since I was probably 6 years old. That lasted for probably six months and then things started going downhill.
Over the past three years, she has gotten delusional and I believe she's hearing (and possibly seeing) things. She's very, very paranoid and cannot reason with anyone about her mental illness any longer. I'm not sure I can pinpoint the time when it took a turn for the worst, but my now-fiance and I started noticing some strange things about 3-4 years ago. She'd wake up in the middle of the night (or just not sleep at all when she was manic) and start talking to her dogs like they actually were talking back. I mean, I talk to my cat, and I'm sure other people talk to their animals..but this was different.

Once I moved out, I wasn't around her near as much so I didn't realize how bad it had gotten. I started to come over every weekend to visit my dad and that's when I noticed things weren't right. My fiance and I run a cell phone repair &amp; sales shop, so she'd ask us all these questions about her phone and how people were hacking into it, etc. No matter how many times we looked at both her phone and laptop and assured her that nothing was going on, she wouldn't believe us. Then she was sure people were hacking into her router and refused to even give the wifi password to us when we were over. She went through 5 phones in about two months because she was so convinced people were hacking into them. She even bought a go-phone from Walmart, new in the package, and somehow it had been hacked by the time she got home from the store.

She started to tell my dad that he was keeping a large sum of money hidden from her from all the ""work"" she had done, and that my dad and his banker were stealing it from her. She hasn't worked in a good 15 years, since she has been dealing with her illness. Before then, it wasn't anything special - just a normal job. She started to get convinced that her probation officer was her partner IN THE TEXAS RANGERS, and as of today, she still believes she works for the Texas Rangers AND the Virginia State Police - we live in Texas and her family and she are originally from VA. She thinks she's broken up crime rings. She goes on and on about how her aunt used to work for the CIA and she (my mom) was born on an Airforce base so that gives her some kind of special....something. I don't know.

She had a blog that she wrote in constantly - probably at least ten blog posts a day for at least a year. Those blogs were very wordy and didn't make any sense at all. Very unorganized thoughts. Recently, she managed to change her password on her computer, so she thinks it's hacked, and she's been taking her blogs to Facebook. It's rather embarrassing and frustrating, especially when she mentions me or my father in them.
For the past year or so, my dad and I have caught her talking to herself. Just about three months ago, I started to notice she was contorting her face and making very strange facial expressions and moving her lips when no one was talking to her. I'm worried she has developed schizophrenia or another serious illness and she needs help. However, she absolutely refuses any help.

In October of 2012, my dad and I managed to get a mental health warrant from our county judge, and the sheriff's department came out and served it. That was hell. They took her to a mental health facility here in our town and they transferred her to a mental hospital in Houston. It was an absolutely terrible hospital and they did nothing for her, our family, and just kicked her out as soon as her 72 hours were up. They were going to send her to a woman's shelter if we didn't come pick her up right that instant, even though we lived hours away and were given no notice that she was being released. I could go on and on about that...ugh.

As soon as she got out of the hospital, she was just more angry at my father for putting her there and nothing was different. In fact, it may have made things worse. I'm terrified that she's going to end up hurting my dad because she believes that he is hiding/stealing money from her and setting her up to be ""raided"" or something else.

Earlier this week, I made the decision to tell her that she needed to get help or she was not welcome at my wedding in October, because of her facial expressions and her strange behavior. I'm her only child/daughter, so I thought this would encourage her to get help. Nope. She told me to ""kiss off"", called me Dr. Phil, and also threatened to basically kick my ass. Very hurtful and EXTREMELY frustrating when all I'm trying to do is get her help.

She recently visited her psychiatrist again, but my dad and I are both 100% certain she doesn't actually tell him what's going on, what she's hearing, etc - she claims the doctor has told her she is ""far from crazy.""
I'll attach screenshots of some posts of hers so you can see her writing style and jumbled talk, as well as the conversation we had.

We're located in Texas. The mental health system is an absolute joke and I have no idea where to go from here. I just want her to get some help but it's impossible when she refuses to accept the fact that she needs it. :(","['pobj', 'pobj']",-1,neu_vader

I've heard Effexor can cause hallucinations but it's so surreal. I feel like I'm losing my mind; even in the morning I can't remember what day it is or where I am. That's a major subject in my lucid dreams.

If I skip 'em for about a week is that long enough for symptoms to return? I just wanna hear what they have to say, determine if it's bullshit, then get back on my normal medications. 

I swear one of the whispers I heard today said, ""You have to kill yourself"". If they're starting up on that again I want to know.

I won't go into details but she said some things I didn't like and in return I yelled at her saying some things she didn't like. She called me disrespectful and told me to get out of the house. She didn't speak to me, or even acknowledge my existence since it happened.

A couple days ago I got sick and tired of the way she was treating me so I went to her and begged for forgiveness and cried. She didn't pay attention to me at all so I grabbed her arm. She slapped me and told me not to touch her. I apologized over and over, told her she was right about the things she said about me, told her I was wrong, told her I promised to be a better daughter. She screamed in my face to get out of the house and that she never wants to see me again, that if I'm still inside the house by nightfall she'll tell my dad to send me to the hospital and tell the doctors there that I'm a danger to myself and society so I'll stay there. I packed my things, contacted my relatives who live closest to me, asked them if I could crash at their place for a couple nights. They said yes and picked me up and I stayed for two nights.

I know I can't stay there forever. They're tight on cash and having an extra mouth to feed would be troublesome for them. So I asked them to drop me off at my house while my parents are gone for the whole morning so I could pack the rest of my stuff, get what I need, get out and find a place to stay. I didn't have many options. I only have a couple relatives I can stay with. They both have financial issues and it didn't feel right to stay with them for long. My grandparents have their own house but they're in Britain for my sister's graduation and will only be back on Saturday. My only choices were to stay in a cheap hotel, or take a car and drive to the park and stay there. But the hotel, which is a 10 minute drive from my house, costs 40 bucks a night for the most basic room, and the car that I planned to take has a history of breaking down unexpectedly and I have to fix it. I don't have money for either. I have $30 on me and my bank account is still tied to my mom's. I tried to ask my sister if I could borrow some of her money. I know she has a couple hundred on her. But she won't talk to me. My mom won't let her.

My aunt told me she would talk to my mom when they got back. So I stayed in the house until my parents came back, told my aunt they were home, and she came over and sat me and my mom down. She told me to repeat my version of events, so I told her what happened. I looked at my mom after I finished, and she had this shocked expression on her face, mouth wide open and all. My aunt looked at her, asked her what her story was, and she started crying. She said she would never do anything like that. She said she was shocked that I would ever come up with that. She said she loved me dearly, she would never say the things I claimed she said, she would never hit me. She said my ""schizophrenia must have been acting up again"" and that I ""hallucinated everything"", that I was being delusional. She had the nerve to ask me if I'd been taking my medication. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I wanted to scream at her and call out her lies but my aunt told me to pipe down and let her speak. My mom just completely broke down and said she didn't know what she did to be accused of things like that. I was fuming. I told her that's not how schizophrenia works, that you don't just hallucinate a whole string of events. I tried to argue and stand my ground but my aunt told me to calm down, and told my mom to relay her story.

She said I fell unconscious and hit my head a week ago (true), she told my dad to bring me to the doctor (false), I didn't want to (false), I was bedridden for a couple days (true), she asked me to help her with something (true), I yelled at her and told her I didn't want to help her because I was in pain (I didn't yell at her from the start, but I did tell her I couldn't help her because I was in pain), she apologized and said she would leave me alone until I got better (false), she wanted to bring me to the doctor again (false), I yelled at her again and said I was fine (false), she broke down and said she just wanted me to be okay (false), I said she was lying and she didn't actually care about me (I said she doesn't give a shit about me because I wanted to go to the doctor and she wouldn't bring me), she said she was trying her best to be a good mom and didn't know what she had done to get screamed at (false), I said I hated this family and wanted to run away (false), she begged me to stay (false), I said I didn't care about her or any of my family members (false), I packed up my things and ran away (true).

The whole time she was telling her version she was crying and sobbing, and after she finished she said sorry to me over and over again, that she cared about me and was so worried about me when I was gone. She asked me to come back home and stay, that this is my home and she wants me to be safe and well. I was speechless and couldn't say anything, and my aunt wrapped things up and told me to apologize to my mom. I couldn't say anything else, because there was nothing else to say, so I just said I was sorry. My aunt made us hug, and said she was glad that we're on good terms again, and left.

The minute she left my mom glared at me and told me to go to my room and stay there. I complied, because I was tired. So now I'm here in my own bed. I didn't expect things to turn out the way it did. I don't know if I expected worse or better. But I'm so angry. Using my illness against me. It got me questioning if I was going crazy, if I really did hallucinate the whole series of events, if I was really delusional. I started questioning everything. I'm not sure about anything anymore.

He said he owned his own business reselling things, and that he had over 50 employees. He said he was a millionaire, and that he had a recording contract to sing. He even said his dad shot him as a kid and then killed himself.


I had trouble believing him for a lot of it. I'd ask questions like if you were shot, where is the bullet hole. But he always had an excuse, like it just grazed me. Or when I asked him about his money, he said Apple was suing him and all his accounts were locked. When I press for more details, he doesn't have them. Yet he always has an excuse on why what he says, he can't back up.


One night we went out drinking with friends and he got super drunk. Finally confessed that he doesn't have millions of dollars. He really is very poor. When I asked him why he lied, he said he was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder when he was a kid and he remembers things that didn't happen. He said he doesn't intend to lie, but when he looked up his bank accounts, he didn't have any of the money he remembered having.


I tried to get him set up with a therapist. He said he made an appointment weeks ago, but I just found out a couple of days ago he never called. I made him call with me on the line to make sure he got a new one set up. We tried, but had to leave messages.


He's not currently on any medication.


He recently got kicked out of his house, and I don't know if he has a job. But he says he has a job offer for $95k a year. He's 21, doesn't have a college degree and has barely anything on his resume, so I can't believe him, but he insists it's true.


He also just yelled at a bunch of his friends for no reason. And told me a lot of things that weren't true about them, like they charged a bunch of money on his credit card that he doesn't remember charging.


Now we come to tonight.

He said one of his exboyfrends who keeps calling him posted in m4m on craigslist with his current picture, address, and phone number (he's living in a hotel, technically homeless). He called me crying saying that he has no idea how he got his number, or address, or picture. But he's getting tons of calls and email messages which are making him very uncomfortable.


He's coming over to stay with me because he's so upset.


Honestly though--and I have no other reason to think this other than I think this--I think he posted that himself. And wondering if that an actual sign of schizophrenia. Like that he knew this person kept calling him, harassing him, and somehow he's bringing this fear to life through making this post.


How can I convince him to get help? He doesn't want medication but I think he desperately needs it.


What do I do if he did make this up? Is there any way I can find out? Should I reconfirm his believes or challenge them?

I'm writing a Noir fiction novel in which the main character is schizophrenic (more info on that below). Thing is, I'm not schizophrenic myself, and I want to get things right concerning my character's personality. At the same time, with all the stigma attached to schizophrenic people, especially in the domain of fiction, I wanted to know the opinion of people who actually experience this disorder (and therefore, the stigma). I want to know what misconceptions you're tired to see in schizophrenic characters, what you think I should avoid or include in my character's personality and behavior, etc. Also, not my main goal here but if you feel like sharing personal experiences with me (either here or in PM) that you think could help me build my character, please feel free to do so. I'm aware all kinds of people are schizophrenic and I don't want to fit everyone in one box, I just want to find out more about schizophrenia so I can write an accurate portrayal of it in my book :)

Ok so here's some info about the character and the plot that might be pertinent:
- My character name's is Nicolas and he's a mid-30s functional piano teacher who lives in the city, and grew up in the countryside.
- The plot revolves around the disappearance of one of his student with whom he had an affair, and a string of child murders that occured some years ago in his native village.
- Nicolas is intelligent, analytical, highly creative, funny, cynical and sometimes a bit antisocial.
- He suffered from head trauma a few weeks before the events of the novel, and is suffering from partial amnesia. He spends a good part of the book thinking he might have killed his former lover (he didn't, though)
- He started showing symptoms of schizophrenia when he was a young adult.
- He takes medication, but neglects it from time to time.
- He sometimes has a hard time dealing with his hallucinations, but most of the time, he can tell what is real and what is not. However, his fantasies are very elaborated (ie: he hallucinates people that don't exist, yet age, get sick and develop complex relationships with him, even if Nicolas knows they're not real).
- Nicolas' hallucinations get worse when he's under stress, and often refer to a major psychological trauma he suffered from when he was 15.
- Nicolas' struggle with his own mind has led him into extreme situations, such as depression, substance abuse and developping suicidal tendencies. While maintaining his professional, artistic and social life relatively healthy, his mental state was one of the main causes of the failure of his marriage.
- Even though the people around him knew he was in a bad shape mentally when his marriage wrecked, he never mentioned the schizophrenia to anyone except his doctor. Most people around him have put much of his behavioral abnormalities on the account of the drug use and depression.
- He has a daughter.
- He has an older sister who is schizophrenic as well. Contrary to Nicolas, her family and friends are aware of her disorder. She's being hospitalized in the city. Nicolas visits her often, takes her outside the hospital from time to time and takes care of her.

Maybe I'm in the wrong place for this, but I've exhausted my options really. 


My brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia about 3 months ago, and ever since his life has taken a drastic nose dive. I want to help him so much, but I don't know where to start. 

At the time of his diagnosis, my brother had been living in a recovery home not very far from where I live. (I would've let him live with me, but my landlord is a complete asshole and would've lost my place.)  He has been battling drug and alcohol addiction for quite a while,  but here, he was finally sober. He had a place to stay... 3 hot meals every day, and quite a bit of freedom. (Much better than living on the streets like he did before I got him into this program) 
He seemed to love it. I visited him often, we talked, we laughed, we had a great time... Everything seemed like he was going to be okay. 

However,  After he was diagnosed with schizophrenia, he gave up on it all. He left the program, bought a bus ticket down to the town he had been living in and left without saying a word. From what I've heard from mutual friends, he found a job and was living with a friend... But had recently gave up on it all and left without a trace again. 

I'm heartbroken guys. He's my best friend and I just want him to be okay. I pray to god he hasn't relapsed, but I'm not very certain.  

I also know he isn't taking any medication... And that he's now homeless. 

What can I do to actually help him? 
How can I help him take his medication? 
He's such an amazing guy. I love him with all my heart and I know all he needs is to stay on his meds.

A small excerpt from the abstract:

&gt; **Context**:  The use of antipsychotic medication for the prevention of psychotic disorders is controversial. Long-chain ω-3 (omega-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may be beneficial in a range of psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia. Given that ω-3 PUFAs are generally beneficial to health and without clinically relevant adverse effects, their preventive use in psychosis merits investigation.

Now, I do not know anything about schizophrenia, I am not schizophrenic nor do I suffer from any other psychotic ""disorders"" (sorry if my wording is offensive; I am not familiar with the terminology).

Now I'm not trying to come here and say ""eat your fish a few times a week and your schizophrenia will be gone"". I know that it is more complex. But if one small thing can help, why not try it?

So I just want to rant/rave for a second on the intelligence-hinder properties of my antipsychotics.  I'm an actual genius and I know what that means to say that on the internet.  People don't believe me, or they want to argue about the definition of genius, and they say every test you've ever taken didn't actually measure intelligence because they don't like the idea that they might not be the smartest person in the conversation.

Whatever.

Believe it, don't believe it.  I went off my meds for a week before taking a few tests for entrance to Mensa.  I didn't really want to join Mensa (although I did for two years to give it a shot), but I was concerned that my own assumption of my brain power was due to delusions of grandeur so I wanted a legit testing.

I had to go off the meds because on the meds, I feel like I'm running in mud when I try to think on real tough stuff.  There's a book called Meditations by a Greek philosopher named Marcus Aurelius.  It's heavy, heavy stuff.  The line that has me thinking now is: Away from thy books, suffer not thy mind any more to be distracted, and carried to and fro; for it will not be; but as even now ready to die, think little of they flesh: blood, bones, and a skin; a pretty piece of knit and twisted work, consisting of nerves, veins, and arteries; think no more of it, than so.

I've read it on and off my meds.  It's clear as day off my meds but on them, I need to break up the sentence into pieces, then form those pieces into a whole.

There's an upside too, though it sounds insulting.  When I've got my brain running on all cylinders, I'm a real asshole.  Your average conversation is a little dull to an average intelligence, but it's a hammer to the brain to someone with an oddity like mine.  On the meds though, I can just sit, and chill, and have a conversation.  I can be genuinely interested in what they have to say even knowing that it's going to banal.

I know the tradeoff is mostly IQ for sanity, but I kind of like not firing on all pistons, too.  I take adderall when I want to write a book or something and I get most of the genius back without the mad bits.  But even though I have the prescription for everyday, I only take it when I'm going to do something real intellectual.  I even do lectures without it just so the stupid questions don't bother me.  Everyone still considers me a genius, but I know I'm capable for so much more.  I don't want to go off the pills.

Any other tips you have would be great, I'm open to any and all suggestions. 

PS. Minus ending it. I know there's a fucker out there whos going to try and get off on that and still I rise. bitch. ",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

I'm a new poster to this sub reddit and feel like all I do is ask questions or advice.  Right now I'm feeling scared.  I've been on medical leave from my employer for almost two months at their recommendation.  I know they were reading my thoughts and talking about me. The office wanted me to rest up and ""take some time for myself"". I took it and did everything I could to get back to the place I was before my two hospitalizations.  I've worked with my doc on changing my meds around, going to therapy once a week, practicing yoga and medication, and practicing coping skills. 

However, I'm still scared they are reading my thoughts.  I know they were all mutated to have this ability.  My husband is sweet, but just trying to convince me that they can't read my thoughts isn't really helping. I go back to work in a little over a week.

I wanted to see if anyone might be/have been in the same boat as me, and what coping skills helped you get back to working or least dealing with scary thoughts.

Thanks everyone","['dobj', 'conj']",-1,neu_vader

Maybe it was his condition(s) or maybe our personalities just didn't mix well. Maybe it was both? I don't know, but I'm interested to know if his behavior lines up with the behaviors exhibited by those with schizophrenia. I know this is a sensitive subject and I don't mean any disrespect toward anyone. I'm only interested in understanding this situation a bit better. I'd probably mislead you if I only talked about his most prominent symptoms so I will just tell you everything and you can intuit the possibility from there.

He started out the semester well. He went to class. He was in a very difficult major and seemingly doing well in school. He was also very intelligent and that was obvious. Early on though, I noticed some strange behavior. When I tried to talk to him he was very friendly but he seemed to only ever talk about his own interests. If i tried switching the conversation to something that I thought we'd both be interested in, he'd change it right back to something in the direct center of his interests. 

He was a bit monotone and seemed a bit anxious inside. I didn't think anything of this because I was too. I later realized that he had been extremely depressed and anxious through out high school and seemed to carry some of that still. Before I realized this was such an issue I'd try to keep the door open to our dorm room so that people could come in and meet us. Every time I did this, he'd chastise me about how this was lame or weird. I came home one day from going to lunch with my parents and he said he was so thankful that I was home because he was having a panic attack for the reason that there were other kids from our hall outside our door and he thought they would come in and talk to him. 

He spent a large portion of his day sitting at his computer binge watching anime and adult swim TV shows. He also was an avid gamer and would play constantly. Around this time I just thought he was a very anxious person and that he and I were very different but overall still normal. He would hang out with kids in our hall and carry on normal conversation. However, things began to get worse.

 This by itself wasn't all that weird; however, the gaming started to take up more and more of his time. Eventually he stopped going to class. Instead he would play games all day or watch his favorite TV shows online. He would stay up and watch Youtube for hours at night (a ritual of his that seemed to grow more and more severe). This was one of the main causes of his sleeping in from my POV. He just wouldn't stop until he was sleepy, I guess. He would sleep in until 12 and just consume media for hours. He stopped talking to me unless necessary. He stopped hanging out with the kids in our hall. He stopped showering. He stopped eating. He would just buy chips at the gas station and eat them all day. Sometimes he'd stop by subway but that was once a week at the most. He was also extremely irritable. I spilled salsa in the fridge and he'd scold me while he splashed hot sauce all over the wall and never cleaned it up. His entire side of the room was a mess and he would get furious if I tried to clean some things up. I once asked him to give me his trash so I could take it out for him (it was overflowing) and he screamed at me because he lost his game. He eventually got suspended from school leaving him more time to carryon with his activities.

Despite all of this though he was very good at putting on a mask. He seemed and acted completely normal to outsiders, which was offputting to me because he was always upset, anxious, and quiet when I was around.

He supposedly had severe ADHD so bad that he was on the most powerful medication and it wasn't helping him. I suspected he had autism but I just wasn't sure. He didn't seem to have delusions beyond a childhood naivete of thinking he was a fighter (literally physically fighting) or that he could conquer any problem. I never noticed if he reacted to any hallucinations but he wore noise canceling headphones and didn't speak to anyone.

I know this isn't a formal diagnosis, but this is pretty much the closest thing I could ever get. This is pretty much just solely my curiosity and I'd appreciate any insight. Thanks.

EDIT: A couple other things I forgot to add. He seemed to have a sleep disorder. He couldn't get to sleep until 4 am most nights and would sleep in until 12 or anytime from 1-3. He took a sleep aid but I don't think it helped. He also had no ability to set goals for himself. He tried turning over a new leaf by cleaning and being social when the next semester came but it didn't last longer than 3 days before he fell into his regular pattern. He had all types of medications including SSRIs, anxiety med, ADHD medicine, but it seemed to only help a bit. I don't know if he stayed on them or not.","['pobj', 'pobj', 'conj']",-1,neu_vader

I grew up an only child and would often carry on conversations with myself, I couldn’t tell you when they began. I would from time to time see a bright flashing light with my eyes closed. I would look in the mirror for 20-30 minutes and make faces and talk in strange voices. It wasn’t as though the voices were coming from outside sources, just me being silly and bored. I incorporated some of them into my humor and still do to this day.  I was a very bright student though lacking motivation, my parents heard this from teachers many a time. My mother attempted to trick me into taking ADHD medication when I was in 8th grade and after figuring it out I dumped all the pills. I don’t really recall any other symptoms or possible symptoms from my youth.

I was raised in the church but became a staunch atheist during college. I started smoking weed in the summer of 2012 after resisting for my entire life. My use slowly increased while I experimented with psilocybin and LSD. I began to sense that maybe I was wrong about being an atheist after what I had felt were prolific psychedelic trips. I sensed that consciousness wasn’t what I had been led to believe it was, that there was something deeper to it. I began exploring and also researching if others had similar experiences and conclusions. This is where I discovered Ram Dass, Terence McKenna, Buddhism, Hinduism, Shamanism, etc. I thought wow, these people have the maps! I would see glimpses of what these religions and people describe as ‘enlightenment’ but it would never last. My weed use had slowly increased to everyday use, going to school and work high, never really giving myself a break.

I continued using psychedelics against my own advice, knowing that they were no longer helping me on my spiritual path. I still clung to the hope that one more trip would get me across the sea. It slowly dawned on me that the new tabs I was taking were not LSD, but some research chemical or 25i. My final three trips got weirder and weirder. I was experiencing conspirital thought loops about the police and jail while also believing my use of household appliances directly contributed to the deaths of many people. My water heater sounded like screaming babies so I thought that I was indirectly responsible for the death of those babies when in reality it’s just the noise the water heater makes when it’s filling back up/heating up. I would get very far out in meditation, the further I went away from my ego/thought stream, the weirder the thoughts would be that brought me back. I would just try to accept them as some unconscious piece of me but damage was done. I find myself drifting back to these dark recesses when I meditate, particularly when meditating under the influence of marijuana. I also knew I needed to stop smoking but I felt the benefits of a malleable consciousness outweighed the financial and social burdens it was placing on me.

I’m not sure if I am having visual hallucinations but during a period of soberness on a medical mission to Africa I was having stomach pains and my vision was obscured by little bits of light. It’s difficult to describe really. Like I could only make out pieces of objects and people, enough to still be aware of what or who they were and still cognizant enough to continue conversation. If I had not had so many psychedelic trips I would have freaked out. Instead I just rolled with it and the day was one of the most surreal and blissful days I’ve ever had. Fast forward 3 months later and it happens again while have a deep conversation concerning consciousness with a friend of mine. This time accompanied by large quantities of marijuana. Then just last week it happened at work upon returning from lunch hour. The only drug I had ingested for the past week and a half had been alcohol. It lasted for about an hour.

After returning from Africa I had a fruit fly infestation in my house (I forgot to empty my trash before departing). I killed most of them but those fuckers are hard to get completely rid of. There were many times when I wasn’t sure if I had seen a fruitfly or if I just had spots appearing, now that I think about it I remember sharing with one of my friends that I had little black spots in my vision from time to time. This was a continuation of these spots but they were made worse but me not always being able to distinguish if it was a fruitfly or just a hallucination. These particular visions have stopped for the most part.
After my last bad trip I cut psychedelic use out of my life, haven’t had any in 3 months. I continued my pot habit but I am quitting. I’ll go 1-2 week sober and then relapse (people that say you can’t get addicted to marijuana are wrong). This past Wednesday I was feeling pretty spiritually high, and I decided that I would quit for sure, for real this time, but I wanted to go out on my own terms. Fucking stupid. The plan was to smoke an 8th and meditate. I smoked and then read some of my king james bible, then I listened to a song I’ve been working on, recorded a few ideas(the creativity that comes with marijuana is a contributing factor to my use), then decided I was getting to heavily into my ego and went to lay down and meditate. It was a return to those hellish psychedelic trips I’d had. My mind was in conspiracy loops and I was terrified of what was going on in my thoughts. It shook me pretty bad and I’ve decided to seek out help from one of my old psychology professors, even if I’m not sick it will assuage my fears that I am.

Worth mentioning is the tingling sensation I get in my forehead/sinus region. This first started on psychedelics and carried over into marijuana use though I now feel lit from time to time when I’m sober. I’ve read a little on Kundalini energy and it seems to be somewhat similar. During marijuana meditation I could feel what seemed to be an uncoiling of energy vibrate its way up my spine, stopping short of where the heart chakra would be. Equal energy would descend from my frontal lobe and also stop before reaching the heart chakra. I’ve had intense vibrations of my spine and body, though not sober.

I noticed when under the influence of marijuana I hear things that I’m not really sure are happening, not voices but things like the house creaking or something falling. When high I’ll swear something fell off the counter and I’ll go to look and everything is just as I left it.

To sum up one possibility is that on my journey to explore consciousness I’ve forgotten where I came from, where I started.

To close this, I am giving up marijuana for good and will continue to stay away from psychedelics. Giving myself some time sober will hopefully get me back on my feet.

I'm very concerned since I don't know the extent to the diagnosis or if the diagnosis is true. The manner in which she told me was very blunt and quick I had no way to prepare for it or knew how to handle it. It arose when I refused to turn the lights on in my bedroom to fall asleep and she went ballistic telling me ""there's someone behind you so turn the lights on."" After 10 minutes of arguing I turned the lights on and she told me ""I'm diagnosed with schizophrenia, that's why."" I had many questions to ask, the most important being if she was following her medication. She quickly cut me off and told me she didn't want to talk about it and turned to sleep and ignored me.

The following morning I've asked about her being medicated and she showed me two oval-shaped fairly large pills yellow/orange in color and said ""this is what I take for it"".

What should I look out for?

A lot of people (besides the ones that knew me) said I had anger issues for calling ""people"" out for treating me like shit. The mental hospital I went too after a week was like, ""You clearly have schizophrenia."" Looking back the broke it to me in a way that was acceptable. 

This education system is fucking whack cause all my life I've been excluded expect from the realist in society; mostly those normal people who didn't fit in because they couldn't afford stuff like clothing or people who got hated on. It's been a lonely trip cause they didn't group us together by who we were. I only had Eminem, and if you haven't been a fan of him for the last fifteen years I don't care to explain how he has evolved. I'm 26. Most of my gf's were psych majors or on the same boat as me. I probably would of been gay, but my childhood at elementary school play ground was traumatic more than hearing offense language in a rap cd. 

While in the mental hospital they gave me risperidone, and a couple weeks after recovering and taking the medicine independently (about the average time it takes to actually work), I heard voices clearly for the first time. I mean, I thought I heard voices before but it could of been something in the background, but I didn't want to be that crazy guy looking for the voices so I just said fuck it and dosed off to sleep happily. Plus it was like comments from a group of best friends. HOWEVER, These voices on these meds spoke with a different tone and different respect and different conversation. These voices had like twenty people conversing at the same time at times while CLEARLY being the only source of noise. 

It took about two months for me to feel it changing my brain. like... you'll know the feel if you take this pill. People ask how I'm doing and I cannot lie without out coming fake as hell. ONE of many reason why I stopped taking this medication is because one of my friends responded ""dude did you actually read the side effects cause it will cause you to become schizophrenic if you take it."" 

One of the scariest experiences is when this guy I met at church. Sure take me home after being denied entry into this temple and thoroughly creeped out by their Jesus loves you videos. The pastor of my branch drove me knowing I would be sitting in the waiting room for like four hours. Looking back the dude I met at church study was clearly schizo. I almost spent the rest of my life in his basement that night. If I can give any advice to anyone in my situation, say the NSA has been watching you and your roommates are such arrogant pricks that your cat would starve to death in your room. (cause their dog would probably eat your kitten)

Both the people mentioned above (black plump dike and unshaven looking white guy) took this medication at one point and shared the interest of religion, ME and jazz music. I mean, he was probably growing out his beard to look more manly. LMAO fuck you if you think looks make you like having a beard cause you'll might be the next suit or in a dead end relationship. 

I literally I feel I attract things into my life just by thinking about them, so it sucks to be you normal people clinging to your holy bibles or bull shit upbringings. It does get better for us though cause I embraced pride weekend and got a few new leads with women. OMG I can feel it coming... talk about coming together for Christ. 

Thank God for Eminem, Kendrick Lamar and Tech n9ne. There are a lot of benefits from being part of this family, so do remember that there are people fighting against this whack society. Hold strong friends because I have started an inner fire that cannot be put out. 

I want to ask for support but wont directly ask. Bread crumbs are not only found in fairy tails, so always do your homework before the work week. It feels good living in a society where you are not crucified like Jesus. I do believe that most the charters in the Book of Mormon and stories from the Bible was based on people like US.

My question is two fold:
Mugbloods, what if I told you that you're thinking is the product of 2000 years of kids being allowed to act like psychopaths. Sleep on it before you wreck yourself. 
#oneminded: What content do you feel from your experiences would help raise the next generation? Or just whatever you feel needs to be said.

My applicable advice is to sign up for Uber with my code lzzjt and start talking to people. I welcome anyone who's used to my code to bounce ideas off me. Making a mistake does not make you mistake. Listen to the Art of Charm podcast, the Art of Manliness and Star Talk Radio to get on point. Try to stay away from alcohol cause you'll feel the full force of it... kinda like everyone else is dumb. Thank the Lord for that burning bush... Even though I personally never cared to read that story; the idea is still meaningful in my life. 

Even though a devoted Christian/best friend abused me (in one more than one way) and a Mormon who turned to Buddhism acted like Buffalo Bill. God bless whatever energy is out there that makes us one. You can pray for my response but won't get any response until I am financial balanced in this whack society. Have fun working 60 years till retirement in this system (assuming they don't keep bumping it up)...

*-Irritable or tense feeling

-Trouble concentrating

-Trouble sleeping*

At the time I was also learning the realities of adult responsibilities, as well as hassles of living in a poor quality apartment, which all contribute to these outward appearances that might have been interpreted as 'symptoms.' I have had been outspoken and have challenged school administrators' policies before as well


 At the time I was in a phase of my life where I was very curious in a diverse range of topics, from sociology to placebos to psychology, different from my academic studies. I could see why the professional would view me as having the symptom of

*-Thoughts that ""jump"" between different topics (“loose associations”)*

 I do not believe my mental state is consistent with schizophrenia at all. I was prescribed medication and warned that my symptoms will get more severe if I am not treated. In order to help me make a decision, I had my DNA sequenced. I do not have any of the many documented DNA polymorphisms
associated with schizophrenia, nor is there any family history of any psychiatric illnesses. The cost and negative effect of treatment was too undesirable and I refused treatment. I took a sabbatical from school, organizing my life and managed my living conditions while working part time. Now I am feel and function fine and do not show these *'negative symptoms.'*

 I also take issue with the validity of the 'assessments' that convinced the psychiatrist I have schizophrenia. They seem as unscientific as those 'Which Hogwarts House Are You?' questioniers and personality quizzes found on social network sites

 My return to school is dependent on this specific psychiatrist's recommendation. The diagnosis was put through a committee, however this psychiatrist's opinion was weighed heavily there and there was no independent review. 

**If this diagnosis stands,  I might not be allowed to return to school if I do not go though with treatment,**


**What can I do now? How do I have the psychiatrist to reconsider the evidence? What are my medical and legal rights?**

He didn't show up for school yesterday, which was very weird for him because he's a good student. So I texted him twice, got no responses within 30 minutes, so I called him. He told me he was having a paranoid episode so I went to his place.

Normally his room is clean as a whistle, but when I walked in it looked like he had been robbed. All of his posters on his walls were torn down, all of his things were strewn all over the floor, none of his lights were on and his window was draped over. 

He says his upstairs neighbors placed cameras and microphones in his room, and he's convinced because he heard voices talking about him and about what he was doing at specific moments, for example, getting into his bed the voices said ""what is he doing, getting into bed so early? He didn't even go to school."" He tore his room apart looking for microphones and cameras watching him. He had set up his laptop and his studio microphone to record audio and hid his laptop and covered the microphone record light with tape to block the light. He also tore apart the duct tape he put to hold his vent up apart, thinking a microphone might've been hidden in there. 

I talked to him, and he seemed reasonable and knew what he was doing was (pardon my language) insane, but he couldn't shake the paranoid feeling and never admitted 100% that his neighbors wouldn't go through the trouble to spy on him. 

I had to convince him to come to the second class that day, and he seemed fine the entire time and went home fine. I checked on him a couple of times and he didn't say he was still feeling off, but I could tell.

I'm a 20 year-old female who goes to a university and am about to be a junior. I have always excelled academically and in rising up in ranks in extracurriculars. Here's the fun part: I'm gay. My freshman year of college I was very in love with another girl, and despite the fact that I am not religious, I began to have these crippling fears that I would go to Hell for being in a gay relationship. I was able to squash them for awhile, but after finals, I ended up having to be committed to a psych ward because of how bad my anxiety and depression were. I was very close to attempting suicide.

Fast forward a bit, I got out of the ward shortly and began taking medications and things were looking up. Until the middle of my sophomore year, when I got addicted to benzos. This led to a total breakdown and I committed myself because the withdrawal symptoms were making me suicidal. After getting out of that facility, not much had changed, but I learned new ways to calm myself that didn't involve getting stoned to a dangerous point.

Things had been going really great until last week. I cut off contact with my father 5 years ago, claiming I was angry that he was leaving my mother for another woman. And that was true. But there were always some underlying things that I never wanted to admit. I told my mom, finally, about some of the inappropriate things my dad did and said when I was young, and how much he creeped me out.

I told my therapist what I'd told me mom. I have many, many signs of past sexual abuse, but I don't remember any actual abuse occurring, yet my therapist spent an hour trying to convince me that my father was sexually abusive.

Which brings me to the main issue: I sometimes have auditory hallucinations. Most of the time it's like hearing my name being whispered or called, but there's no one else around. This only developed recently.

 Something I've always had is the angry voice in my head. I could be thinking ""I want to go to the park today"" and it will change to an incredibly angry tone ""I WANT TO GO TO THE PARK TODAY."" This has freaked me out a lot. Because 90% of the time, the angry voice is just finishing my thought. But there have been times when I was thinking something, like ""I need to call Mike so I can see him soon"" and it gets changed midway to ""I need to call Mike SO I CAN KILL HIM."" This happens so rarely and I usually convince myself that it's a thought I wanted to have (no idea why).

So, Reddit, can you put my fears to rest or help get me in the right direction? I would like to secure a government job upon graduation, so I'm hesitant to talk about my fears with a therapist. Thanks for reading this rant!:

This fucking illness has really taken a toll on me.  I am a completely different person now.  I grew up obsessed with everything.  I'd conquer one hobby after another, always moving on to new things to be interested in.

I decided I would chill until I could trust my mind again.  It has been well over a year since I made that decision.  I have made no effort to follow politics, I don't watch the news, I don't read books, I pretty much just watch TV.

- I'm a 27 year old male.
- We both live at home with our parents.
- Parents pay for and manage my brothers treatment along with a psychiatrist.
- My brother lives like a hermit.  He laughs at the voices in his head. Paces for hours to appease the voices that tell him to walk.  Refuses to drink or eat foods that are not in sealed bottles.  
- My brother has been on tons of different antipsychotics and antidepressant medications.
- Throughout these 3 years, my brother had a 3 month period where the voices stopped.  He was on a combination of Risperidone and Effexor, but the Effexor was phased out and he went back into psychosis and hasn't been out of it since.
- My brother is brilliant, but he has no quality of life in the state he is in.  This is probably the 3rd psychiatrist my brother has seen.  None of the doctors seem to be doing much.  They just prescribe an antipsychotic medication, my brother usually refuses the meds based on a real or fictitious aversion to some side effect (gagging while eating, leg stiffness, etc) and then they put him back on Rispiridone, which doesn't seem to be doing anything to help his auditory hallucinations.

So here are my questions:
Are there psychiatrists that specialize in schizophrenia?
Where can I get my brother some intense help?
What do I do if he refuses a medication or treatment?

I have really bad paranoia, like really bad, to the point where I absolutely can't move while Im in bed about to sleep, otherwise I feel that someone is going to shoot me or whatever else.

I sometimes see figures, usually shadow-like but mainly humanoid. They are usually running and I only see them for quick seconds.

I also feel like someone is watching me and is outside my window a lot. I mean a lot at night, to where I find a knife and hold it with me.

I sometimes feel things that aren't there, recently I checked into a hospital for mental remediation (due to OCD, tourettes, anxiety, and depression) and I felt like something hard had fell on my shoulder, I looked and nothing was there, noone was around. Not sure if this is Schizo, but I wanted to put it in there.

My grandmother has schizophrenia, OCD, Tourettes, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, etc. and a lot of my family has suicided or has substance abuse...

What do you think Reddit? Again, I am posting because I want to at least sorta know, my doctors don't really know if I do or not. It's also gotten progressively worse.

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
Depression (this is almost over honestly, taking good meds for it)

Why should schizophrenia be considered a disease? What is a disease and what isn't is poorly defined. Schizophrenia is a difference which can't be cured. Sure - it can, if the symptoms are not controlled enough, cause distress to the person or other people. In this case, treatments are prescribed for the results of this difference. However, if the symptoms don't cause any distress to others or the person in question, why should this difference be systematically treated? What I'm saying is that it's not a disease by itself. It can cause distress, but it doesn't mean that it always has to be systematically treated.


This might sound strange, and I acknowledge it. But think of, say, race. According to scientific studies, there are various differences between races. Differences in IQ (with Eastern Asians being on top), differences in skin color, hair color, eye color. For a member of some race, their IQ may result in distress due to learning problems, for example. Then, that person is placed to special education programs and such, in order to help with the learning process caused by an IQ difference. But does it mean that the entire race which has an average IQ lower than an arbitrary, socially constructed notion of ""acceptable IQ"" should be placed in special education programs? I don't think so.

Just as autism is more and more accepted as a difference, I don't see why many so-called mental illnesses shouldn't be accepted as a difference. Don't get me wrong - these differences can cause distress. But they're still differences, not diseases. Even autism has approved treatment which control some symptoms, such as irritability (ex: atypical anti-psychotics). But it doesn't mean that it's a disease. It means that sometimes, some traits which accompany the difference can cause distress to the person or others. But it isn't always the case.


We're different and unique, not diseased and undesired. Perhaps, schizophrenia was an evolutionary advantage in the past, but is simply not as advantageous now. Should we also treat all, say, ""ugly"" people? Should we also, as a society, propose surgery for them in a systematic manner? Why not? After all, being ugly can often cause distress. (Even though what is ugly now could be beautiful in the past; due to various differences in cultural views on what beauty is.)

Please note that I'm not against treatment. I take psychiatric medication myself. But I still consider myself different, not diseased.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

This week I'm ok. I'm off meds, hearing voices, but I'm ok. Tomorrow I was going to call in sick and go to my mental health place to go to some groups and meet with my case manager as he requested I go to the groups. 

I told my sister(who I got a job at my workplace so she works with me), and she said I was just being lazy and that if my case manager knows I have a job he shouldn't expect me to go to the groups unless he wants me to get fired.

So that set me off on a whole getting fired thing. I've been working there for almost a year and a half. I like it. I don't want to get fired and I don't want to seem unreliable or disappoint my boss. My boss just said to me today, ""Try not to get sick again"" because he needs me. He doesn't want me out. 

I don't know what to do. I want to go to the groups tomorrow. I want to meet with my case manager. But I don't want to seem lazy or miss too much work when I've missed so much last week.

This has happened before, though. I missed a few months back starting in May because I was hospitalized after the onset of my schizophrenia symptoms. I was insanely psychotic and everything was really bad. So I took a break from work, moved back in with my mom, and returned when I felt better. My boss was understanding and nice and wanted me to take as much time as I needed.

He doesn't know I get psychotic or hear voices. I'm also a cutter, and so he assumed my schizophrenia was my cutting. 

I could try to talk to him. Try to get him to understand why I need tomorrow off and that I can still check my emails and respond to clients from my phone, but I'm afraid I'm still going to look unreliable to him.

My fiance stopped taking his meds (again...sigh) last month, and even though I tried to warn him about the eventual consequences of not taking them, he was already far gone enough to not remember why he needed them, and thought that we were trying to destroy his creativity by making him take them.

I knew that he would eventually end up hospitalized again if I couldn't convince him to take his meds.  But it's not like I could force him to take them.  I'm upset that he's back in a facility, since it's been five years and he's been doing so well.

I feel bad because I saw it coming and I didn't know what to do to stop it.  His caseworker and psychologist knew that he was off his meds, but they told him ""We can't force you to take them"" which made it impossible for me to convince him he needed his pills, even though they've worked great for the past two years.

So he's in a mental health facility about three hours away from me, and he's doing better- for several days he was drugged up and upset that he had been institutionalized again, but today he called me, sounding much more coherent, and he called me back a few hours later, as soon as they'd let him, because he wanted to make absolutely sure that I'd heard him tell me ""I love you"".

Now that he's in the hospital and the biggest concern isn't getting him somewhere that he can get help, the problem is....

He has no clothes.

I feel awful....He opted for an EMT. He dragged out a folding chair to sit and wait in the driveway for a cop to come and get him to take him to the hospital.  But for some reason, in over an hour of waiting, it never fucking occurred to me that my fiance might need some goddamn clothes while he's hospitalized.

I'm so stupid.  It never even occurred to me.  He's been hospitalized before but clothes have never been brought up by anyone....I guess I always had bigger problems than wondering what my dear man was wearing while hospitalized.

But this time...this time he's in a facility that's 3 hours away and no one appears to be interested in making sure this man has clean clothing to wear while he's institutionalized.  And I don't know what to do.  My hubby-thing has plenty of clothes...I just don't know how to get them to him.

I have enough money for the gas to get there, I think I might be able to swing enough money to feed us while we're there if I delay doing our laundry until the next paycheck.  But it's far enough away that it's not really feasible for us to drive there, visit him, and then drive back again in the same day.  Our budget is really tight, and after paying all our essential bills, it looks like there's no way I'll be able to make the three-hour-drive, there and back, and also afford the cost of food and a hotel for our six-year-old son and myself while we're there.  I think I can probably come up with some inexpensive food that can survive in a cooler long enough to be eaten, but that still leaves us with the ""where to stay overnight"" problem.

So...I guess it sounds kind of ridiculous, but I really need to get to the town where they're holding my fiance.  So I can visit him, so he can see his son (who kept me up last night for the first time, crying because his dad is gone) and so I can give him a kiss (because it's breaking my heart to sleep in an empty bed, without him), and so that I can bring this man that I love some clothing so that I might slightly improve his stay in this place that is sure to be hellish for him, despite the fact that they are doing their best to help him.

I've been wondering about the Ronald McDonald house, since I've donated to them several times over the years, but have no idea how to request help from them.  At the same time, I guess I'm requesting assistance from anyone out there who feels they have enough to spare that assisting me in getting a hotel for a night in Michigan's Northern Peninsula won't cause them any difficulties in the future.  I hate having to ask...my family is dirt poor, and his family doesn't seem all that interested in helping the non-religious black sheep...his mom is ""saving for vacation"" and his sisters are coming to visit her from CA next weekend, and no one seems to be able to spare a hundred bucks or so for the overnight cost of coming to see their son/brother a little over 200 miles away.

I'm just...at a loss.  I have no idea where to turn at this point.",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

Two phase III studies evaluating bitopertin for persistent, predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia did not meet their primary endpoints; third study is ongoing
Three phase III studies evaluating bitopertin for sub-optimally controlled symptoms of schizophrenia are ongoing
Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced that two phase III studies of its investigational medicine bitopertin (RG1678) in adults with persistent, predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia failed to meet their primary endpoints, based on the negative symptoms factor score of the positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS). Negative symptoms include social withdrawal and lack of motivation.
In the studies, adding bitopertin to antipsychotic therapy did not significantly reduce negative symptoms at 24 weeks compared to placebo. Bitopertin was generally well tolerated and its overall safety profile was similar to that seen in the previously reported phase II trial (NN20372).
A third phase III study evaluating bitopertin for persistent, predominant negative symptoms of schizophrenia is ongoing. In addition, three phase III studies investigating bitopertin for sub-optimally controlled symptoms of schizophrenia are in progress. Sub-optimally controlled symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, are symptoms that do not resolve despite treatment with an antipsychotic.
“These results are disappointing for people with negative symptoms because more effective treatments are needed for these debilitating effects of schizophrenia,” said Sandra Horning, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development at Roche. “We will await data from the remaining bitopertin studies in schizophrenia before deciding on next steps.”
Data from the studies will be submitted for presentation at upcoming medical meetings.
Neuroscience is a major focus of research and development at Roche. By advancing the understanding of the underlying biology, the company’s goal is to discover medicines for people with neurological and psychiatric conditions. Roche’s neuroscience clinical portfolio has 10 new molecular entities, including three in late-stage programmes in schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.","['compound', 'dobj']",-1,neu_vader

Don't fight with me and threaten to take it away! And if you want me not to take it, then offer me something to supplement! Like some sort of therapy (which I have mixed feelings about). Don't just take it away and give me nothing! Just give me the damn pill and send me on my merry way!

Using information people share about themselves for mockery and derision is shameful. This post was not about any particular issue, but people are fixating on my lack of medication and contributing to the problem I wrote about here!**

This is a great sub and very useful. It is one of the best subs I visit. It is amazing that people with psychotic disorders are more understanding and caring of others than other subs.

Aside from the occasional post from someone who is apparently in another mindset (the nonsensical disorganized or clearly delusions posts which), most people seem quite lucid and insightful. 

Being open about one's diagnosis and symptoms and experiences can be difficult. I have personally only told one person explicitly about my diagnosis of schizophrenia. It simply is not very useful to share this diagnostic label. I usually say I have a ""neurological problem which affects my senses"" and people accept that readily.

But there is a minor problem I think we (and a person in particular) should consider. **People who admit they have a psychotic disorder should not have this revelation used against them.**

There is an epistemological issue where one can always cast doubt about anything. Human ability to ""know"" is limited and never certain. Unless a person is clearly expressing disordered thinking or delusions or one can verify one's claims, one should accept what other people state about themselves.

Just because any person *can* have poor insight into their symptoms, that does not mean people do unless you have clear evidence of these symptoms which a person denies. 

The fact that someone does not use psychiatric drugs should also not be used against them either. Yes, I live with the symptoms which I have without medication. The [reasons why are complex](http://blog.faolan.org/2014/10/schizophrenia-and-psychiatric-drugs.html), but in short, I have had psychotic symptoms since [infancy](http://blog.faolan.org/2014/08/born-into-world-of-terror.html) and in adult life they are much more bearable and mild and I will not do anything to upset the current balance of my brain. 

My psychosis was masked through poor communication and good behavior.

I am more content being me and more insightful into myself now than I have ever been. I am, for the lack of a better word, happy.

So please:

* Do not tell me I should take drugs just because you know I do not. They are not cures, schizophrenia is not an understood diagnosis, and the symptoms I have are bearable. This is not typical schizophrenia...the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and strong psychotic symptoms in infancy make my brain not a typical case of schizophrenia for which those drugs are most often used.
* Do not assume I have poor insight to symptoms nobody can observe. I, and anybody else on the Internet, could be very deceitful. But barring evidence, do not make accusations or assumptions about individuals. 
* Do not stigmatize people just because you know they have a psychotic disorder. The flair I use here is used to give context to my posts and to show my acceptance of this diagnosis. It is for others, not for me. If I did not have it, other people would never suspect I had a psychotic disorder. In fact, on /r/aspergers, some people do not know I have Autism Spectrum Disorder (that sub has no flair at the moment). I am usually considered a clear writer. That is one strength I have and I use it.

I'm having a really, really hard time right now because I'm so unsure. I don't have auditory hallucinations or visual ones, just flashback-sort of things where everything gets ""tinted"" with some kind of aura or it feels like I'm in a completely different place. I'm getting so scared that there are people that are trying to undermine me. One girl, Diamonique who's into black magic the same way I am I'm convinced she's trying to steal my boyfriend so I'm going to perform a spell to backfire one I know she cast. I'm afraid I don't really have schizophrenia and that I'm just fooling myself and all of the stuff that's going on or makes me scared: the whole ""other world"" the other reality that exists on a different plane that's overlaid over this one and that I have the chance to be privy to, I'm afraid it's all not real and I'm just being dramatic and exaggerating.

Ever since I was little (3rd to 5th grade) I'd have really really intense episodes of the ""tints"" or the other worlds. My teachers would take me aside or bring me to the social worker because I was disrupting/not participating in class and then the social worker would try to figure out what was wrong. They simply couldn't understand a word of what I was saying and looking back and realizing how dense people are they probably thought it was all garbled nonsense, so they told me to stop acting out and to sit outside in the hallway alone until I was calm enough to go to class. Of course I couldn't calm down but I knew I had to go to class so I would just sit and cry in the hallway until I wasn't so afraid anymore and then go back to class and then just spend the rest of the day in class scribbling over my assignments and not talking. A couple of times they brought my parents in and asked all kinds of questions like ""Is she okay? We're not quite sure she should stay in school"" and they would hint at all sorts of awful stuff like sending me away. My mom always insisted that there was nothing wrong with her perfect baby who was just extra imaginative and had a hard time fitting in at school, so I was never sent away, but I also never got treatment.

Naturally by the time I got older I realized that I had to keep this stuff hidden no matter what otherwise I'd get in more trouble. I've been keeping it hidden all my life and trying and trying every day just to live normally and not get in trouble like that again. It's just so hard because I want to express myself but after years of hiding I'm not able to and I want to be able to experience everything I KNOW is there to the fullest extent and be happy and healthy (completely, I'm very healthy otherwise) but I just CAN'T. I can't get over the fear of getting into that headspace and getting put in situations and trouble that's beyond my control. I can't risk it because it's already happened so many other times in my life and I don't want it to happen again. I don't want to be hospitalized and told I'm crazy or put out of school and work and be unable to see my friends and family and live my life.

I finally got diagnosed a year ago but refused medication until last december (when I had a break and missed my finals) because I was sure that I didn't need to start taking heavy drugs for something I've had all my life and lived with (mostly) just fine. I got one prescription filled for Abilify but then my family changed its insurance (I'm 18) and I couldn't see my psychiatrist anymore. So far this year, I've been without a psychiatrist, and I started to feel different on Abilify. I felt a little more paranoid but I wasn't sure if that was a side effect of the medication or a side effect of my brain freaking out because I was *taking* medication :P In the end, since I didn't have a doctor to guide me through the process of getting used to a new medication, I decided I should stop taking it until I had a steady doctor and just keep dealing with the symptoms of schizophrenia on my own.

Now I'm just trying to sort myself out but I'm wondering if my psychiatrist actually just prescribed me placebos and I don't actually have schizophrenia, but everyone's acting like I do just to keep me at peace and give me the ""treatment"" I've been asking for. I'm really not sure. I'm just scared and fighting this and I just want to have some sort of clear solution, a meditative process or something to ease my mind. After the break I just drank all the time and that was okay but I know I can't do that. 

I feel like such a failure. I'm trying to double major in art and economics. I'm taking economics courses next semester, but I only had three classes and I STILL wasn't organized enough to submit the portfolio I've already made before the deadline, so I'll have to wait another semester until I can start taking art classes, but the art program has a lot of credit requirements, so that might mean that I won't graduate from art in four years, or I'll need to take summer classes, but I've already gotten a fantastic summer job for every summer and I'm afraid I won't have time unless I quit it, which I don't want to do.

I keep trying to ask for help but I don't know what kind of help I want and no one is able to support me in the way I know I need. I do feel like a fraud. I've talked about psychosis and its particulars with some very close friends before but I can feel that they all know I'm lying even though I don't know whether I'm lying or not and I can't shake the feeling that no one has sympathy for me.

I remember one night it got really bad I had every light on in my house so I can see if anybody was around me (it was ~3am), the power went out and I REALLY lost it. I yelled and just fell on the floor crying, hoping to god that nothing will happen, and I ended up falling asleep like that. 

Another thing is that I haven't been able to sleep lately, at all. It's getting to the point where I'm starting to give up trying to fall asleep until I just pass out. When I try to sleep it's impossible for me to get comfortable, and there are millions of random thoughts racing through my head. Another weird thing that happens when I try to sleep is I sort of hallucinate but not really. I don't know how to explain it, when I close my eyes there are flashes of random faces that I've never seen before, but I don't actually ""see"" them. They just get ingrained into my mind, like they are there and I'd be able to describe them perfectly. Usually these are weird pure white faces smiling, but sometimes there are crying women or really angry looking people with cuts all over their face. 

When I do manage to sleep I have really realistic and depressing dreams. These dreams usually involve me being framed for a crime I haven't committed and am going to be sent to get executed in a couple days. For about half a minute after I wake up my brain assumes that the dream wasn't a dream for a reason and I'm really stressed thinking I'm going to die in a couple of days, until I realize that it was just a dream. Other dreams include everybody in my town but me dying, my house burning down, family members getting sick, me getting sick, and etc..

As I write this now I feel as if somebody is going to creep out of the darkness and kill me before I can even post this. 

I've been seeing random flashes of lights everywhere for a couple weeks now. When it started they were all white and lasted less than half a second, but now I'm starting to see a lot of blue ones now that last 1-2 seconds. 

I remember one night I was really upset and looking out the window of my room at my neighbors tree, and after a while the leaves started to form these little bats that started dancing around. I grabbed my glasses and then looked back at the tree to get a clearer look, and the leaves formed this eyeless face that looked like it was laughing, I closed my eyes them opened them and it seemed like the leaves made this snake that looked like it was coming at me. I closed the blinds and ran to another room with no windows in it. 

I've never done any drugs in my life, or have even smoked marijuana. 

The thing that really scares me (should of probably started the post off with this, but I thought it would be funny to leave it until the end) is that my father was a paranoid schizophrenic. I've known this for a while, and I know a little about it but not much, or enough to come to any conclusions. I assumed that if I was ever even concerned that it has been passed down to me, I obviously didn't have it, since somebody like that wouldn't ever admit that there was something wrong with them, but that just leads to a paradox and like I said I don't know enough about the disorder. 

Sometimes I hear slight whispers that I can't make out, but I think that is just my mind playing tricks on me, like I want to think I'm crazy or something.

Something that I should probably note here is that as a kid I've had a lot of small problems too, but they weren't that big of a deal. I had a pretty sad childhood that I don't want to get into a lot of detail in, but to put it short me and my sister were in an abusive foster house for 5 years. I used to ALWAYS have catatonic (I think that's the word) episodes where I zone out of everything around me and it's like I'm asleep with my eyes open. It usually took a lot to snap me out of it. I remember one time I think I was 8 or something, I was waiting for people to come pick my up from school, while waiting for them (they were really late) I zoned out at my school's lobby place. Because they are idiots they just gave up on trying to snap me out of it and left me there until 9 pm when the secretary woke me up. As you could imagine I was terrified, since I was 8 years old having to walk a far distance at a time that felt really late to me. 

As a child-early adolescence I've always seen slight glimpses from the corner of my eyes of shadow people stealing my stuff. It wasn't a big deal I just sort of laughed it off and tried to block it out, and it's gone away since. 

I'm just really scared that his schizophrenia has been passed down to me because I can't control these thoughts and feelings or what I see. I feel a deep hatred for my parents for even considering having a child knowing the possibilities. What makes me doubtful are the stories I've heard of him and the things he did. Apparently he was really religious and thought that he was an angel sent from heaven, (I'm an atheist) he labelled certain people as ""hellions"" or something, which are people sent from hell to disrupt the plans that god has made for him, and that he would go out on the middle of traffic and pray. This does not sound like me or anything I would ever do, but I can never know.

The thought of going to a psychiatrist to get evaluated terrifies me. I'm afraid of being misdiagnosed or any type of medicine they give me turning me into a brainless zombie. I just want to know what's wrong with me, so I'm desperately posting this big pointless block of text on Reddit.",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

I was young, I really can't recall how old, but I remember there was a man in my closet. He would swoop out of the closet, his arms outstretched towards me, above me. I had to look him in the face to make him recede back into the closet. It happened for multiple nights, before I got the guts to run out of my room and go to my mother. I was a sobbing mess, I was terrified out of my mind. That night was the last night I ever slept with the lights out, No lie.
Skipping to more recently, I have a numerous amount of visual hallucinations. Voids in the walls. Odd creatures coming out of my mirror (the last one I remember was a stork looking bird, but it was just the neck that stretched out of the mirror towards me), large, blackish-grey slugs, seeing the walls closing in on me (not a claustrophobia thing), giant faceless head that sits in the corner, I could go on forever. Occasionally some auditory, to me it feels like a radio broadcast in my mind, different voices saying different things that never make sense, some of them are angry and I get nervous. Sometimes it's just endless laughter.
I occasionally have paranoid feelings that people can read my mind, people are watching me and following me, if I get really bad I get really weird about alien abductions.
Other symptoms are mania (haven't had a manic episode in a very long time however, even off of medication. I will get hypomanic if I consume alcohol, but I feel as if that's pretty common), extreme depression, lethargy, aggression (some of my comments and actions towards my family are pretty brutal), dissociation, depersonalization, derealization. I have a self harm and suicidal past, but I haven't relapsed into those in a long time. Veeery bad at talking and making complete, understandable sentences. A lot of mixing words, making up imaginary words was a big thing a while ago. A lot of pretty hellish intrusive thoughts, very violent, lots of bad scenarios and remarkably twisted actions. I twitch too, but I think that's a side effect of my current medicine.
Current diagnosis are Bipolar Disorder and Asperger's. Prescribed 80 mg of Latuda, but I never take it. The side effects are absolute hell and the idea of brain-warping chemicals make me nervous.
I really am not asking for a diagnosis; I just want to hear the opinions of people diagnosed with schizophrenia about what I experience.
Should I talk to my psychiatrist about this more? I never went too in-depth with them about it out of fear of her telling my parents.

I don't know if this is strictly the right forum for this post, please direct me elsewhere if it isn't.

I just wanted to know if anyone here has taken Geodon (or its generic version), and whether they've experienced what I've experienced.

The pills actually seem to help tremendously, EXCEPT I get very, **very** acutely tired. Not mentally tired, really, but my body seems to ""give up the ghost"", as it were. I take it before bed, and if I get up at night for any reason I always feel a force dragging me down. I may be standing in the bathroom and suddenly get very dizzy and feel the need to collapse.

The feeling is lessened, but still quite strong throughout the day. i stopped taking the medication before for this reason, but I wonder now, does this subside over time? Some side effects of medication go away, others linger. Does anyone have any experience with this, or anti-psychotics in general? Did you find that these issues go away with time? 

The fact is, I can't exist in this continuously weakened state. I have trouble dealing with people, and it's greatly compounded when I'm tired. A drug that ""helps"" my symptoms, yet causes me to be chronically and severely fatigued, is really no help at all.

I don't have an official diagnosis but I've been hearing voices for eight months now. I've also had ideas of reference and shit for about two years. I almost always knew that these things weren't actually happening, that they were just in my head.

He likes to take walks and wander around public places, and lately he has been getting into altercations with strangers whom he accuses of ""gang stalking"" him. It's only a matter of time before something bad comes of this. I try to spend as much time with him as possible but it's a big job. He lives with his father who has also tried every approach in getting him to take his meds, but he is adamant in his refusal. Can anyone give me some advice? I love him and I know he is suffering- please help me reddit I don't know what to do right now.","['dobj', 'dobj']",-1,neu_vader

I am embarrassed to bring up my symptoms to anyone more than I already have and am not sure where to turn. So, when in doubt, go to Reddit, right? This is a bit long, but I would appreciate any help offered. 

A bit of my past-
I have had depression for over 10 years and have been on medication for most of those years. I was diagnosed with Bipolar II about 2 years ago. About 1 year ago, I went off of all of my medications for my depression/bipolar and anxiety. My doctor refused to take me off anything because I needed them, or so he said. For about 2 months, I went through hell with the withdrawal symptoms and wouldn't wish that feeling upon my worst enemy. 

Fast forward to 4 months ago. I was laying in bed and randomly started hearing talking. The thing about the talking though is where I'm confused. I couldn't make out what was being said, but there were 2 people talking and it seemed like it was to each other. The voices weren't whispers, but they weren't loud. It seemed very muffled, but 2 distinct voices. Since then, I am still hearing a lot of similar voices and also I am hearing whispers that don't really sound clear, along with random noises, for example, sirens, doors slamming, and water running.   Occasionally I will hear a voice clearly and it is a male voice seeming to talk to me. I have tried responding before and other than feeling dumb, I get no response.  

Now, fast forward to 2 months ago. I started seeing something. I'm not seeing specific things most of the time, though some occasions I have. Usually, I'll see something move out of the corner of my eye and I'll quickly look while trying to catch a look at what I'm seeing. Each time I look, the movement I see moves further away out of the corner of my eye and it's just an evil cycle. This seems to happen a lot throughout the day. I have also seen faces in the walls and random things appearing like spiders or even just spots or cracks in the wall. 

Additionally, I am very paranoid about a lot. I really started thinking about when my paranoia started and can't pinpoint it, but it feels like it's been a long time! Some stuff that I notice are: at night when I am in bed, I can see slightly out of my bedroom door. The only light on is from my TV which is in my bedroom. Outside of my bedroom, there is no light. When I am laying in bed, my blanket needs to cover at least my eyes so I can't see anyone/anything that's out of my room. If I wake up to use the bathroom, I am nervous and when I leave the bathroom, I look in the other bedroom (that nobody sleeps in unless there are guests) and shine my flash on my phone in there. Other times, I walk around with the flash on looking for someone that's inside with me, besides my wife. I've even checked behind the shower curtain and still do. 

Before I forget, I should add, I'm in an apartment building. Regarding the noises and voices I hear, no, they are not neighbors or noises of the building shifting in the wind. The noises and voices I hear don't just occur at my apartment, it's anywhere!

To continue, I also hear noises in the hallway outside my apartment door. The hallway is an inside hallway with 1 common door leading outside. With all that said, when I hear noises, I seem to quietly run to my door to look through the peephole to see what I can. Sadly, I only see 1 door, the apartment across the hall. I still tend to run to see if someone is standing at my door listening. I do this quietly so if there is someone there, they can't hear me coming to watch them. 

I have talked a very small amount about this to my wife. I'm told to see a doctor, but I have had bad experiences in the past and a couple involuntary hospitalizations that have put a bitter taste in my mouth. I am very scared, confused, and have a great feeling of loneliness. 

If you've made it this far, thank you for hearing my issues. If you can offer anything constructive, I'm definitely open to reading what you have to say or add. If I need to elaborate on something more, please ask!

We played in a band together and on a softball team, and hung out several times a week and always had a really good rapport with each other. 

The first step was withdrawing from these activities, participating less and less before just quitting outright.  Then he started smoking weed.  About a year after I noticed these initial symptoms, he had this crazy incident where he drove across the country, changed cell phone numbers and emails several times, and maxed out his credit cards staying in hotels. From the road, he sent a series of emails to the president of the university he had graduated from, his old professors, and even President Obama, ccing me, several of our friends and his family, accusing them of taking part in some unknown conspiracy that would result in him being imprisoned and subject to sexual assault for the rest of his life.

Shortly after that he ended up in psychiatric care, and was diagnosed with a schizophrenia-family condition (schizoaffective I believe, not positive).  He went to live with his mom across the country, was put on some very strong medication, and I just kind of lost touch with him for about four years.  He never picked up when I called, and would only occasionally text.  I found out he was working part time at a gas station (he was a really smart guy who easily could have gotten a much better job before his diagnosis).

At this point, I had just written him off as ever seeing him again.  I sadly assumed he was completely crazy, would never be an independent adult, and would have to live with his mom or in a group home for the rest of his life.

I recently found out that he was moving, by himself, back to my town!  I am filled with very mixed feelings. Mostly I am really happy to get him back.  But I'm also filled with many questions. Is he ""better?""  Will he resemble my old friend in any way?  Is he able to return to his old life with medication, or will he be a stranger?  

Anyway - any advice or stories of similar experiences would be appreciated. ",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

I cut off contact with him for a few years, but I had some of his stuff and went to return it to him. In order to understand why I cut off contact, read on.

We hung out for a while, and the majority of our relationship was centered around using drugs together. He would often talk about his delusions, and gossip about people he knew or had known. I actually saw his writings about people using their real names on the web. In general, he won't take responsibility for anything he does. He has been in trouble with the law and speaks as though he was being unfairly persecuted. He is emotionally immature, like he is permanently stuck in a rebellious teen phase. He's actually a paranoid schizophrenic. These personality traits are red flags, needless to say.

I hung out with him reluctantly (partly out of pity), after I returned his stuff, and unfortunately he has my phone number and has been calling me and rambling on about his ideas which are nonsensical. He has no future to speak of, since he is schizophrenic and unemployed, and seemingly uninterested in getting better.  I can never tell when he's on his meds or not.  He doesn't trust doctors, including them in his personal delusions.

I feel sick when I'm around him. I've given him numerous signals to show lack of interest, but he barely gets the hint. I don't think he has much of a social life. I'm not interested in wasting anymore energy on him. I also feel that if I continue hanging around him he will try to get me back into drugs, so I cannot hang out with him for that reason either. I want to tell him that I don't want to hang around, but I'm worried it will feed his paranoid delusions. I don't believe he is physically dangerous, and besides, he lives fairly far away and doesn't drive.

**Is there a good way of saying this so that he understands I don't want to see him without him getting upset?** I feel like maybe if I just say we are on different paths in life, maybe he'd understand, but I don't know. Last time I just stopped talking to him and he didn't bother me. I've also thought about changing my phone number, or blocking him. But a relationship feels unresolved when you just ignore someone.  His schizophrenic paranoia complicates the issue too.

**Or is it better to just ignore him like last time and let the relationship fade again?** I talked to a psychologist who told me that a schizophrenic is likely to forget about a person, as they get caught up in their own delusions. Is this true?",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

Earlier, i was in a public gathering, and i was with a friend (lets call him Dave), and a man we also knew (lets call him Robert) had tried to enter the building. Robert, a 7 foot tall man has schizophrenia, and has recently not been taking his medication, and as a result has been acting aggressively.

In his late teen years he went through a stage of legal problems, stealing pain meds, amphetamines, doing meth, in a small midwest town...after mandatory rehab sentences he came out and was clearly mentally troubled, but was staying with his family. 

While living with his family he started some business with total financial support from his family called Plott Palm Trees...attempting to grow and sell tropical plants in the middle of Missouri...we were all supportive initially. But he was lying to everyone and really himself.

During all of this, For the last 4-5 years now, he has been showing signs of schizophrenia on facebook, obsessed posting 100s of times a day, making outlandish claims and videos, seemings getting more and more grandeur and insane. He has made multiple facebook accounts that he has reply to eachother, fake girlfriends, overall egomaniac delusional stuff. He claims to have degrees from Harvard, Cornell, and that he is a prophet sent from God. He claims he has cured cancer through his tropical plants that he orders online with his moms money....

I am a conspiracy buff, and respect a good one, but his are all over the place...from anti-zionist, fluoride, chemtrails, obsessing over veganism (all of which are understandable but his paranoia delegitimizes anything he says and he is wayyy too deeply mentally invested)

Now he moved out of his families home and is posting crazed videos and I am concerned. He has been contacted by authorities in the past for his behavior pretty sure, but i am not for doing that at all. I am going to post some of his stuff.

I've been diagnosed in 2013, after what started like a mystical experience but my ego came back full force and it turned into severe delusions.
I was smoking cannabis daily for about 7 months and took some hallucionogen (NBOMe) before this.
After 1 month taking antipsychotics, the shrink took them off and i relapsed again.
Another 1 month hospitalized.
Now, I've been on Invega for about a year (100mg).
I feel kinda sleepy (but it's the weed) and my sex drive is almost zero. I find it so hard to climax when masturbating, thats why i almost never do it. Thats why I want to stop taking it. 

So, long story short, my plan is to get off meds and street drugs.
But I don't want to be ""fully sober"", I think thats boring.
So, according to my psychologist, I will get some kind of ""high"" from schizophrenia, but managing it to not go full psychotic.

I'm not sure I want to do this, they want me to stop the weed for 1 year before stopping the meds, so that year would be so boring.

Can I get some kind of mental fun with controlled schizophrenia?

I wish I could just go back to the beginning of the thing, where i experienced this http://www.spiritualcompetency.com/pdfs/lukoff1985dxmepf.pdf .
I used to read a lot of buddhist and spiritual stuff, and wrote my thoughts a lot.
I thought I was ""enlightened"", and maybe I was.

I want that manic creativity, joy, insight to write songs.
I want to write songs that reflect how I see the world, and right now my world is dull and boring.
I think thats the purpose of my life, I don't wanna work as an engineer all my life.
The only fun i get is from the marijuana, but that's short lived and I don't wanna rot my brain after some years.
I feel I can ""control"" when I start to get the symptons, to know ""it's all in my head"", as I've seen some people say they do. I couldn't do this the first time because I didn't even know what was going on, that i had this ""thing"".

And he tells me I have schizophrenia, and that my voices are hallucinations, and not people, and that the things I believe about them, ""delusions"" aren't true. 

I feel like my whole world is flipping upside down. Before December of Last Year I was just depressed. I wasn't hearing voices yet. I was focused on bad things and it probably triggered it or something, but I've never felt more lost than I do now. Lost in mental illness, lost in what to believe about the world and who to trust. I feel exposed and broken. 

It's like I've lost whatever it was that made me who I was. I stopped doing things I like, I'm not talking to friends as much, and don't feel very motivated to. At least when I was just depressed I was reaching out, now it's like I'm too lazy to let my struggles be known, I'm hiding it. 

I'm off medication right now, I was on a really high dose of risperdal and I stopped taking it because it was slowing me way down and I couldn't stand it. So next time I can get new medication is July 2nd. I keep going back and forth about whether I want to, but my therapist is really encouraging it, and reassuring me that I'm just sick and can't see it, so I guess I'll give meds a chance again. I don't know. 

I hate this. Does anyone else feel like this? How do I get over it? I feel disgustingly alone and lost and I don't have anyone that really understands this. 

I was sexually abused as a kid, and i'm struggling with that as well, my family just wants me to get over it, and I understand that, because it's been a while, but fuck, I can't. I can't forget and I can't move on quite yet. 

I just don't want to feel like it's me against reality anymore. I'm starting to feel like my therapist is too perfect. Like he isn't real. He's too good. People aren't that good. 

I feel like my co worker is somehow a bad guy even though he tries to understand what I'm going through(one of two co workers that know what's going on with me since I had to be hospitalized recently and miss work for 2 weeks). 

My voices aren't as bad as the were before though, they're coming and going throughout the day. Blah Blah Blah, ""Help Us, you have to kill yourself"" ""Come here"" ""Commit Suicide"" 

Their regular phrases, it gets loud and overwhelming sometimes and I get headaches from not being able to focus on anything else. The nightmares are the worst, every single fucking night I have to have a nightmare, every night. It doesn't end. And it's so fucking real that when I wake up I have to take a few minutes to figure out of I even slept because they're usually of me laying in bed hearing voices which is weird as fuck. 

Please someone tell me I'm not alone in all this. Is this all just part of the disease? Will it ever stop? I just want to feel stable again. I feel like I'm scattered across the sky and all that's left is fear and confusion in this body. ","['dobj', 'dative']",-1,neu_vader

I felt guilty for years that I was using the medication as a performance enhancing drug, and that I was cheating out my peers. I don't think it was actually schizoaffective. I don't have hallucinations. What else could it have been curing?",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

I'm not sure if i'm writing this to get off my chest, but we are really lost on what to do.

**Quick Summary**

We have a Sister, who is 26 years old, and is Schizophrenic. originally when she was 4-18 she was just Autistic w/ Selective Moods(?), and mostly manageable. When she turned 20 she started having auditory delusions, and finally at 22 visual delusions. Since 22 its been like living with a homeless person at home. She is hard to bathe, the has terrible odor, and for the most part when on meds sleeps all day. When she comes down from her meds or has episodes it is bad. We're talking, ripping out neighbor's flowers, smashing windows from cars, walking around with her period flowing, and destroying property (legal docs, etc,.). Keeps lights on so she can sleep, or not sleep. Yells and screams at her delusions.

It has been terrible.

**Context**

My family does not have a lot of resources. There are 7 kids with 5 of them being adult age. 1 has a great job (me), 1 has a minimum wage job, and two are unemployed.  The two minor kids are in Middle School and High School. We live in Southern California.  Dad is near useless regarding our Sister, and Mom is who takes care of her Daughter (Sister) during the day, but since ends-dont meet she leaves to work leaving the Sister in the care of the two unemployed adults.

**History**

During her school-age years, we had a lot of support. Unfortunately, mom is not good with paperwork, and I believe she either has ADHD or Bi-Polar disorder or is normal, but cant function with 7 kids + special needs kid. It was a lot to take care of, and I understand why a lot of things never got done correctly.

When our Sister turned 18, the system pretty much ignored her, and our only resources were her SDI benefits ($800/mo) and Medical. 

When she was 20 (auditory delusions) we had to try to use California Code 5150, and she was hospitalized for a few weeks, but eventually returned home. At the time my mom thought she could still be a Business Woman with Herbalife products, make money ""build her network"" and rake in the dough to help keep everyone happy. Unfortunately she is a terrible business woman, and would frequently overdraft her bank account.

One of the biggest troubles about our Sister is that she only speaks Spanish, and wont speak to her assigned Psychologist &amp; Psychiatrist. So making medication changes, or any sort of meaningful evaluation impossible.

Additionally, my mother (despite my offerings to help financially) has not tried to setup a Power of Attorney for my sister, so that we can do more to direct her care.

**Recent Events**

In the last 6 year's I have been trying to convince my mother to admit her to a home so the minor kids could have a stable home life. She wouldnt have it, because in her mind it would be like dumping her at a place. But at the same time, no facility will take on my Sister because of how violent she can get.

I tried to explain to her, that it would be better for her to do so, because otherwise, its selfish of us to keep her with us. And the kids.  They (and I) grew up with this, and it has affected us greatly. Grades, trouble with drugs, and life in general.

My minor siblings live in squalor, and I unfortunately cant seem to get anyone to do something about it. I really want them to live with me, but I'm not sure how to take on my Siblings legally. I have no beds for them, and while I do make money; I would have two dependents that I'd have to take care of and that is not cheap.

This situation overall sucks, and it seems like it has no end insight, and I'm on the outside watching the train wreck unfold.

My best solutions are
1) My Sister improves with proper medication
2) My Sister is placed in a facility to handle her care better
3) I remove the Minor Children from the situation

It's a pretty basic schedule for college kids, really. But, it's starting to get really overwhelming. I get off work really late and have class at 9 every morning, which means I am really tired everyday (If I can even wake up to go to class) and am starting to really struggle with my classes.

I'm just very overwhelmed with my schedule, and don't really know how to manage my time. Especially when I just want to give up every day. I was diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia my first semester at school, and even though it's being managed very well (It's not too severe, I only take Adderall for motivation. I stopped taking the last medicine I was on because it didn't do anything.), but I'm really losing my motivation and drive.

-----

I have an intake scheduled with a new therapist to get to a psychiatrist (we all know the drill) because as of yesterday I'm having new issues... and I'm not sure how to describe what I'm experiencing accurately.

If I had only one sentence, I would say I'm hearing things.  But I don't know if it's the best way to describe what I was hearing almost all day yesterday:

It was like I was outside of a crowded room and bits and pieces of conversation would just float by, like whispers.  Sometimes I'd hear a word and it would be completely random.  Just some weird word.  A few times I'd hear the mumble-whisper and I'd... I didn't hear words as much as intent.  The whispers wanted me to cut these beautiful, intricate designs into the skin of my arm...

I was able, throughout the day, to tell that what I was 'hearing' wasn't actually there.  There's that difference between what you hear with your ears and what you think and it was like that line was really blurry, but I could tell that it wasn't real.  However it would catch my attention completely, like a magnet.  Every time the whispers were... understandable... it was like I HAD to listen.

I'm going to be turning 30 in September.  My family is full of depression with at least one schizophrenic grandparent and a bipolar parent... I really thought I was too old... I don't know if this is what hallucinations are like.  Is this just... something else?  Some weird echo-thought from my abuse resurfacing? Or is this... similar to what anyone who has schizophrenia has experienced?

I just... I don't want to tell the shrink ""I'm hearing voices"" when there's something else I should say, some way I should describe it.  I was on meds for bipolar for almost ten years before they figured out I wasn't friggin bipolar.  I don't want someone shoving a diagnosis and pills at me for no reason.... but I really, really, really didn't like the whispers.



ugh, sorry for the wall of text.

[[edit: added info -- before yesterday, I'd experienced this before but only when I was *extremely* tired or already really upset about something else.  my therapist said since I only experienced it when I was already worked up it wasn't the same as if it were out of the blue and I didn't need to worry about possible schizophrenia]] ",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

Background: I'm 28, she's 26. We've been together for about seven years, and married just over a year. She moved out about two months ago (our 1 year wedding anniversary weekend) and has been living with a friend. We have been going to therapy and it is not going well. She has beliefs that are based on nothing that have overridden beliefs that she has held for her entire life. She is only very selectively able/willing to listen to the therapist's words and seems to be a combination of dead-set certain and simultaneously confused and afraid.

Her mother is paranoid schizophrenic and has been institutionalized for most of her adult life. Our therapist thinks that she is likely in the early stages of disorganized schizophrenia, but wants to give it a little bit more time to be certain. We have not communicated this to her yet.

In the meantime she seems to be doing fairly well and says that she wants to be friends. If it is schizophrenia, its pretty early on. She does seem to be increasingly illogical, convoluted, and unable to comprehend why her behaviors are problematic for those around her. I'm doing OK, though my life is a bit of a living hell right now, I have a close network of loving friends and family that are here for me. I've also gone onto antidepressants (SSRIs) to help bolster me to weather this nightmare. 

I'm looking for advice and wisdom from those that have had to deal with a schizophrenic spouse, or for those with schizophrenia that have spouses. What kind of life could we have if we are able to get treatment going? Is it a pipe dream to think that with medication and therapy that she could have a level of normalcy and that we could (potentially) have a relationship? What are the next few months (assuming [1] it is schizophrenia and [2] that the therapist communicates this to her soon) of my life going to look like? What was it like to be told you are schizophrenic? Did it make you hate your SO or lash out? Were you grateful that they didn't just leave? Any words of wisdom at all would be immensely helpful.

What the media won't tell you is that Travis has been diagnosed with schizophrenia for a number of years. his mother has been in California the past few days trying her hardest to get this information out there, but to no avail. we dont know where to begin. his family can't afford the medical bills or a lawyer good enough to get him the help he really needs and deserves. Travis is not a bad guy. I'm going to post what his mom has been posting on her Facebook page.
My son was shot multiple times last Wednesday as Some of you know. He's recovering in L.A. and is stable. We are wanting to reach the media with a statement as it blew up the news in Cali. But no mention of his illness. We want to raise schizophrenia awareness.we don't have a clue as to how to go about it. Any ideas are greatly needed and welcome.
Travis update re the guns: my ex husband inherited 7 guns and rifles when Dad passed away. They were never brought out, never used. They were packed away in the top back of a closet in a locked room. (Yes, i agree Mark should of had a gunsafe). For a week prior to the incident, Travis had been putting screws into the windows of the house to keep them from being opened. He kept saying someone/thing was after him and getting into his bedroom. We can only guess that his paranoid delusions escalated that day for he broke down Marks locked door and ransacked his room, stumbling onto the guns then. You cannot have an adult committed against their will unless it is very obvious that they are an immediate danger to themselves or other, which frustratingly, is usually too late. And even then, they just pump them full of zombie making meds and send them home within weeks.time for a change.

The problem is this is having an effect on my treatment, or at the very least if making things difficult. The things I keep hearing people saying are that I am eating fried chicken, I do not know how to read, and that I am a hyper-sexual beast. The problem is that the people treating believes this things, and think I am being obstinate in continuing to them. The problem is I do not eat fried chicken, I am not illiterate, I got 167 on the verbal portion of the GRE, and it would not have been possible for me to pass it, let alone do well on it, without being able to read. I do not talk about sex very often, but it is not an activity that I engage in, or wish to engage in. These concerns are somewhat petty, but they are increasingly more difficult to deal with because it is everyone accusing me of it. I used to be fairly good a deflecting the criticism of others when it consisted of only few thousand people, but know it is everyone, and it has made my life more difficult. I can’t stop eating fired chicken when I am not eating in the first place, or pretend I do not know how read when it is what I do most of day, or pretend that I sexual urges that I do not have. I do not think this obstinacy or recalcitrance towards authority.

That being said, I hear people talking about [name withdrawn] disclosing information about me still. I am not sure if he is the primary person responsible, as there appears to be a network of people engaging in this activity. I suspect because of the schizophrenia diagnosis, whenever I report people disclosing my medical information they are easily able to say that I am under a delusion. However, [Name Withdrawn] does not think that I am Schizophrenic, which I would not know if he weren’t talking about me. That is not the primary concern, people talking about me being schizophrenic means there had to have been a leak of medical records. I am not talking my diagnosis with others, I do not talk to very many people. The Doctor saying “He is not schizophrenic” indicates that I have the diagnosis, and I remind you I told no one about this, in order to negate the impression that was.  

It is still improper because people would not be talking about it to being with. I heard my instructors talking about these things, and I think [name withdrawn] might be in contact with a family member, but of this I am not certain.
Since I am in Georgia now and hear similar things, it is likely that one of the doctors I saw in Georgia is performing similar actions, but that I cannot not say for sure. People were sending me death threats, and given the information contained, which detailed accusations of me eating fired chicken and not reading, these people have to be communicating with each other in some manner. Most of the messages were dedicated to painting a picture of me that resembles a lower primate. People seem to recognize my face even though there would be no reason to, as I am not a celebrity, politician, or in anyone of particular importance. This is what bothers me the most, I am not an important person, I do not mean it in humble way, really I am not important, and it does make sense that people are carrying on in this way; people should not know who I am. I am also not allowed to drive anymore because people are yelling at me while I am driving. My neighbors yell at me when I take the dog out, which is one the only reason I leave house.

I am certain that this is happening, and that my current doctors are aware of it, but they will not tell me what they are doing. The people around me are aware that I am being talked about, but they are in agreement about not disclosing this fact to me. I am also certain that people are talking about these things on television, and I do not use the internet very often because I think someone in monitoring me, as I hear people saying I am on the computer instead of reading.

It is difficult for me to complain about this because I cannot always trust what I am hearing. But since I am taking the medication, and I do not hear people inside my home anymore, I am fairly certain that people are talking about me, and that it is emanating from a source that has intimate knowledge of my medical records. The doctor, I am sure, is in part responsible, but other actors are at work as well.

As far as the other people who may possibly be involved, I am sure a former instructor of mine is. However, the driving force for this likely college students, who I do not know, who seem interested in making sure that my medical privacy is not respected and dedicated to creating the impression that I am a semi-literate primate, who eats fried every night, and is starved sexual contact. I am sure that these people are in some way connected with one another.

From what I've read it seems like psychotic episodes aren't something that should be happening very often.  I've heard that many people experience very few psychotic episodes in their lifetime.  I'm wondering if maybe we're doing something wrong, or maybe I just don't quite understand what a psychotic episode really is.

Even when he isn't hallucinating he's often very anxious and worried about being followed and watched by different monsters.  He knows that they aren't real but they are still making him a nervous wreck and I don't know how to talk to him about it.  I don't want to talk down to him or offend him by insisting that he's worried about nothing.  I understand that schizophrenia is different for everyone but I'm having trouble finding anyone that can relate enough to give me advice about how to communicate with him properly.",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

I am currently perscribed two medications for my treatment and recovery of schizophrenia:  Zyprexa(anti psychotic) and Clonazepam(anti anxiety). I was diagnosed when i was 18 years old and started treatment immediately. I am 24 now and with treatment my psychosis has been greatly subdued and the benefits of the medication are clear and undoubtedly necessary, cheers! But it comes with many side effects that inhibit my cognition, memory, and energy thereby effecting my academic potential, social ability, and intelligence. I have come to the point where i am past the worries of delusion and hallucination. I am a student and the responsibilities can be very challenging, and demanding especially with the side affects of my Anti-P. With this plight of treatment i lose my competitive edge in the academic setting. I am not the type to give in to my ""illness"" letting it enable a reduction or complete loss of ambition due to a social stigma that indicates a certain capability. So naturally i acquired the endeavor of enhancing my cognition to regain the mental ability that i so desperately needed. I was fed up with my introspective insecurities of feeling like a drooling idiot and not being able to express my self. I was always tired and did not have the drive or energy to pursue success and development. So i turned to nootropics and started experimenting with all the different avenues of increasing my cognition. I have tried many things but in the past four months i turned to the use of a low dose of amphetamines. Most of my research including my doctor's opinion told me that amphetamines are a ""no no"" for people with schizophrenia because of the increased amounts of dopamine. I have also read that I have a two thirds chance of using amphetamines to my benefit without seeing negative side effects concerning my schizophrenia. In the past four months i have experienced a vast improvement in all of the negative side effects of my anti-p with absolutely no ""break downs"" or reasons to be concerned. I have absolutely no increase of delusion or hallucinations. I am more sociable, more creative, i have regained my ability of abstract thought, i have a sharper memory, and improved problem solving skills. I have had an experience that has changed my life in so many positive ways. I am aware that such an experience could lead to a dependence but i am already dependent on two medications. So the question for me is why not use the resources available to me in my recovery even if there is a risk if i see such enormous benefits? With the amount of progress i have seen I feel enabled to do things i never dreamed possible and i feel like this is a great step toward my full recovery which brings me to my questions.
What are the possible risks?
Are the risks managable with a low dose?
Is there an equally effective and more safe alternative?
Should i continue to use this method of treatment?

How do you deal with the negative effects of the anti-p on your cognitive abilities?

Can you provide some insight on the nature of the conversation between my doctor and i concerning my cognition?
Is there any way i could initiate a more experimental approach with my treatment and are those type of doctors out there? 
Just to clarify i am not an authority or a reputable source for treatment
Thank you for your input!

I'll just go through with what caused it.

When i was around 5-6 years old my mother met a guy. This guy seemed nice at first but over the years, he turned out to be a pretty cruel person, and abused me. My brothers picked on me also and we were all young so it was pretty understandable. I felt very much alone because if my brothers or my step-father wound me up, I had anger problems, so I'd have to take the fall from it. They'd surround me with the person who in the family was messing with me and insult me and tell me I'm being a child and to start being a man and stuff.

Eventually when I was about 9-10, my step-father hit my mother, and she finally realized how abusive he was, we moved away to another place and also we lived in a pub so there was that. We moved to another pub though. I relied on the internet growing up mostly because I lost all my friends moving and we were about 2 hours away from school so I never really could do my SATS in year 6. 

I missed a lot of required education from year 5-6 and then at home I would just rely playing games and such with friends, we used these dongle things to connect, my brothers had their own laptops and they would too, but then my brothers broke theirs because they're incapable of being able to handle anything on their own, so I gave them mine, which made me have nothing to do, and be alone, with my thoughts because nobody would talk to me for about a year and a half I'd sit in my room going on my laptop using paint or playing my Xbox games alone whilst everyone else had people to talk to or to have fun. I'd take walks on the beach too because we lived close to there when I moved.

We had to move again because one of the step-dads friends found us and so we moved way up north the country, which made me feel alone again, even when I had nobody, I had familiar scenery which I relied onto. 

When we got here, we also got broadband so I could actually speak to my friends after not talking to them for so long, but I didn't tell them how I lost my internet, I just told them we had no internet and I was doing fine.

I started going to school again for year 7 up north and everyone picked on me for my southern British accent, and told me to ""go back to London"" and whatever, I'm not even from London. No one would be my friend and the teachers would threaten to break my arms and everyone said my coat smelled like smoke because we lived in a place where everyone smoked so I couldn't do anything about that.

Eventually I med a kid called Connor and he was my friend, but he was the worst kid in the school doing vandalism and etc, he was a bad influence on me. We had laughs and hung out and he finally made me smile again, he even lived right next door to where I lived, I had lots of fun with him, even when his friends disliked me, I stopped caring about what people thought, it just turned me straight off like a robot.

Then one day we were going into school and in the car-park he broke a windshield off a car, and since the camera wasn't looking, the school blamed me because this kid went there for a while and they didn't want to have that effect their reputation on the school board or something. I got a criminal record for doing absolutely nothing. I'd never even hurt a fly.

I moved to another school in year 8 In this new school I started to hear voices, and they would tell me things about others, I started to judge others thinking that they all looked at me as if they wanted me dead. 

When I got to my first class, everyone asked me questions, all through the new classes too because I was new to the school obviously, since I started in year 8 and they all started in year 7.

I was very quiet and reluctant on answering any questions, and this offended the kids there.

The voices also told me to go places and do things, I'd roam around the school or sit alone a lot of the time and I really didn't like talking to other people, the voices were more comforting than others. The other kids then started to put rumors on me because I didn't speak to them. One kid named Josh started spreading around that my family fucked animals, and others threatened to cap my knees, even though we were like, 13, it was still scary for me.

At this time I completely forgot about my life before I was 11, I blocked it all out. Forgot who that step-dad was and I didn't understand why my brothers would beat themselves up over him. They didn't care about how he hit me, they just cared that he hit my mum.

I started going into the special education room, even though I wasn't slow or anything, people were more nicer there and wanted to also be alone too, this was comforting. I was alone to voices in my head and I'd just talk to them within my head and also occasionally go on the internet to play some games too.

Around this time also, I had met a group of friends on the internet and we'd all play games together and just have banter at each other. I didn't understand anything back then because nobody actually told me anything, I mean, I was considered normal from doctors because I wouldn't speak any of this stuff, it seemed normal to me.

I also went on a site called Gaia Online and I made friends there, some were great friends and I could but my trust into them, others, well...

I met someone who I'll call Shelby and she pretended to be my best friend, or she was, I told her about the voices, first ever person I had told about them. She said I was a schizophrenic and I scoffed at it really, I looked it up and I didn't really agree with it, then these other people she found were much cooler, she went to them and told them about what I told her, they all laughed and called me Schizo Chris, then would laugh about other personal things I told her. This didn't happen with just Shelby either, I met another person called, I'll say, Alaska as a name, and he told them and laughed with them too. This made me lose trust in people, because I was always betrayed in some way by others. Those are the two major things I was betrayed by, but it wasn't just them either.

I tried dating on it, I was whatever about that, then that person cheated on me. Not much more too it really.

I started being a little shit on Gaia and stuff, and I'd just troll around and hurt people and I got amusement for it. I was also hanging with that group of friends who didn't know anything personal about me because I thought if I told them, they'd make fun of me too.

I met some friends on Gaia though who were nice, like I said. One was called moon and we were very close. They were very nice to me, we eventually had an argument and went our separate ways for a while though.

In school I was being bullied by Josh and then by this girl named Zoe who would do things like steal my phone and text my family with shit and they'd shout at me and I'd have to tell them it was the kids at my school stealing my phone, they wouldn't believe me though.

At this time my brothers were getting really angry over the step-dad thing, they became abusive, slamming walls if they got angry at games or something, or even choking and punching me. They have special needs and etc, Autism and Aspergers, ADHD and all that stuff. I just passed from it, kept with a straight face and didn't care.

I felt truly alone, the only thing I had was that group of friends, so I just played games with them. I stopped going to school and I'd cry myself to sleep quietly for a few years until I was about 15.

Through the years going from 13-15 I started thinking about the schizophrenic thing, and I started hearing the voices being really mean to me, I'd try blocking them out and they'd just get worse and worse, telling me to do things, shouting at me, mimicking other people I had met in real. 

I was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia for a while and I started talking to this psychiatrist who abused the shit out of me and lied to me, making me speak to people in real and I didn't want to speak to anyone, because I was hearing thoughts from others insulting me so I tried really hard to avoid everyone. This psychiatrist then re-diagnosed me with aspergers which definitely was inaccurate, I was just very quiet to her because she lied to me, saying that she wouldn't make me see anyone, then tricked me and brought people to my house, in my room, to my comfort zone. They kept pushing and pushing and it made me really really dislike talking to them.

I was on Risperidone after being diagnosed and she took that away from me because I wasn't seeing her. She also said if I didn't see her she'd refer me as normal and I wouldn't be able to get any psychiatrist at all.

That group I was in, it broke up and drama happened there, I couldn't be bothered for it, so I moved on and just started hanging with one of the people from that group, and he was starting to talk serious. I was okay with it I guess, even though I don't like serious conversations. They also betrayed me pulling pranks on me and such, I really couldn't handle it with everything that went on.

Eventually I met someone on Gaia who I'll call KC and they were very nice, so were their friends. Then I found out they were all drama cases who had things against each other and I would try to take the downfall for them when they'd get angry with each other. We dated and eventually KC cheated on me too. Big surprise.

Then I was alone for half a year again, a while after I forgave that person who betrayed me for the prank, I started hanging with him again. I also became friends with the moon person again. I was scared of the voices again.

Through those last two paragraphs I turned 16. I met someone who is my best friend today and hasn't left me, even when I doubt it a lot because of what's happened to me in the past. I am in love with her and she doesn't feel the same way, can't really say more than that.

Eventually I was brought to suicidal over things as she hung with me, other things by other people like my brothers, and I overdosed, stabbed myself, etc. I still came home a few days later for some stupid reason. I called 999 before because I was suicidal again and they never visited me. I started believing I was having delusions or that things I did never really happened. This is how I remember things and it very much has scarred me.

I really needed my medication because I was under a shitload of stress with everything, kids bullying me, I had that one best friend but she was depressed too. I had that other friend but he could never talk to me about my problems, only his. That is actually very normal because when I try to talk about my problems, people look or speak to me as if I'm going to explode or that I'm insane. It was very un-comforting, and it made me feel even more alone.

The voices got worse and I started to believe that psychiatrist was the one sending me the voices, she always betrayed me and always wanted to hurt my feelings and I also started seeing things when I spoke to her. I'd see these black distorted faces that would have black eyes and white pupils that would glow and they would whisper to me. I pretended I didn't because I don't know, I wanted to seem normal now and from talking to others I could see they didn't hear voices or see things. I didn't want to be considered insane. It really scares me to feel like I'm not normal. I really focused on that best friend because they were the only one who wouldn't pull pranks on me or leave or anything, thy were always there.

I accidentally told them about my condition, how I felt. They could no longer talk to me when I was upset, because they'd be speechless around it. They would always go quiet or not know what to say and it would depress me even more, make me feel even more alone. The voices would tell me to jump in front of cars when I was outside and the faces would appear and I'd get panic attacks every night. My expression disappeared or had been gone for a while now. 

I'm now monotone and going through 2014-2015 I shouted at my best friend for not understanding. I shouted at them for looking at me different because of what I told her and I felt bad because they are the one person who is there for me. I feel nothing to anyone else and sometimes when talking to my best friend I also feel nothing. 

I pretend to give a shit or have pretended to give a shit about talking to people since about 2013 or 2012, but really, everyone else I've actually felt nothing towards. I learned how to pretend to be nice from watching people and being alone all those years. I want to off myself every day but I don't want to give people the pleasure, or my voices.

I was recently diagnosed by the mental health team again with paranoid schizophrenia and I just do not care about it. I avoid everyone and I find it every hard to work or do anything. I just sit in my room and avoid people so they don't have ot bear witness the voices or the delusions or the things I see.

I started seeing dismembered heads recently all around my home of people I've met, it's un-comforting and pretty depressing but oh well. I learned that this is how I am. I'm a broken person and I always will be like this, can't really do much about it. I'm not motivated to do anything, the only motivation I actually get is from talking to that best friend, and even now, I hurt them and make them not want to speak to me so...I don't see the point.

I'm getting my medication soon probably but oh well, it probably wont do anything anyway.

Dunno if this will get me banned or something for posting this on Reddit. I don't really care if I do. Had enough shit happen to me what's a little ban going to do? I'm writing this because I've got all the time in the world.

Living here has been very hard on me.  I have been isolated from the friendships I had begun to develop, and I have decided to shut my mind off while in my parents' presence, so as not to discourage myself, as they are extremely judgemental.  They shot down all of my plans to leave home, because they were afraid I'd get into drugs, etc.  NOw a days they have begun telling me I need to start supporting the family, I have a responsibility to pay them back for raising me, all this stuff. They are desperate for money. It is way too much pressure right now, I have debts I need to pay off of my own first.  

I asked them why they weren't asking my brother for money (he is away, working as a teacher), and they told me he doesn't owe them because he hasn't lived at home for a year.  But they are the ones who brought me here from school.  They are the ones who guilted me into staying extra long.  I didn't even want to, and now they are treating me like a free loader.  I thought they were trying to help me get through a rough patch in my life.  Nope, now they just want me to start contributing to them.  Not making= money so I can go back to university again (I need a bit of money to remove a block), but money to support the family.  

Honestly, I would probably be just fine staying here and working to help the family if they provideed an opportunity at the same time to grow.  They are extremely restrictive, however.  They tell me how to think, they treat me as a weak person for having acquired this illness, they restrict what I can do, and what I can read.  I have a vivid memory of when I showed them one of my favorite movies, THe Fall, and they all screamed at me and said it was a terrible movie and no wonder I have mental problems.

I feel like everyone's out to get me, like there's some fucking plot against me. My friends all stopped talking to me and hanging out with me, and when I asked my old best friend what happened he said I seemed ""distant"" and ""different.""

When I talk to people I feel completely withdrawaled from the conversation. I feel like my words are on autopilot. 

I'm also getting extremely lazy and apathetic. It's near impossible to care about anything. 

I'm really worried here. I'm afraid it has something to do with stopping cold-turkey on all of my previous medications. This is going to sound bad, but I felt like my psychiatrist was out to get me.. diagnosing me with different shit and fueling me with drugs. I was on Vyvanse, Effexor, Abilify, and used ambien to sleep. all prescribed. 

I ended up abusing my Vyvanse all the time and resisting other medications. Eventually they cut me off everything cold turkey. 

I get irrationally angry and frustrated for nearly nothing. 

It's impossible to fall asleep.

I feel like the aliens I once heard implanted it in my and now my leg is going to explode if I don't cut it open and take the device out, or have it taken out by a surgeon.

I'm thinking of going to a doctor and asking them to take it out/ or x-ray my leg or something. But I don't want to get locked up in a mental hospital. Really badly DO NOT want that. 

Will they lock me away if I say there's a device in my leg? I know my voices are voices.. but.. it just feels important.. more than hallucinations, they may be right. 

I don't think I should perform surgery on myself... that would go badly. 

What do I do? What do I say to a doctor? If I say my leg hurts they'll give me medication but I NEED my leg x-rayed to find what's inside. There's definitely something in there. I feel it.

Voices telling me to kill myself, with some visual hallucinations. The closest I can describe the experience was a picture of a house on the internet telling me to kill myself. It was flashing and saying ""Do it"" repetitively. And lots of shadows looming over my bed in the pitch black. I would turn on the light and they would disappear but I still heard things. I thought something was trying to get inside of me. I felt like my conscious voice was turning on me, it no longer agreed with me and tried to convince me to kill myself. I was sane enough at the time to drive myself to the ER.

I was hospitalized for 5 days and put on some various medications that just made me very confused. All the time, I was so lethargic and spacey and just.. Lost. I was so confused. I recently quit taking my medication because I fear the medicine is meant to keep me confused. I feel like somebody wants me to fail. I finally got accepted into my dream trade, I have my first apartment with my fiance, I have two kittens to help me when I'm feeling depressed.

But recently I feel like it's too good to be true. I feel like somebody set me up. I'm no longer interested in my relationship. I've been thinking about leaving the apartment and disappearing on the streets or something. I cut all of my hair off. I bleached it to try to change myself so maybe these thoughts would leave with my appearance. 

Nobody can see my suffering. I'm confused again. I hear voices following me home every night. I'm stressed out, panicking. I keep packing these feelings down into my stomache and putting on my steel expression so nobody worries. My counselor thinks he understands me. He smiles too big at me, it feels fake. I get defensive and paranoid seeing him. When people ask me to explain my thoughts or what I mean, I feel like theyre testing me. They just want to see me trip up or fail. They think I'm attention seeking. I quit seeing my counselor, and I'm afraid of my psychiatrist. He quizez me on what I mean. I stare at the ground because he intimidates me. I havent called anyone in weeks. I'm thinking about going back to the hospital. But I don't think I'm sick enough. 

At first I thought I was being haunted. I thought a ghost was stalking me, but I'm too smart for that. I know my mind is sick. I just don't know how to fix it. I'm afraid of medicine. I don't want to lose myself. But I'm afraid of myself.

I've been thinking about cutting and hitting myself again, but I hear my mothers voice in the back of my head saying ""Don't be ridiculous.. You're being dramatic.. You are fine, quit acting like your grandmother.. She always wanted people to feel sorry for her."" Am I becoming my grandmother? Just being dramatic because I want attention? No. I hate the attention. I just want to curl up into a ball and sleep for a hundred years.

I'm so sorry for the rambling. I'm in such a lonely place right now. Anybody have similar thought patterns?

We thought she was just erratically pursuing a divorce from my father, but it later turned into more. She was diagnosed a few times variously with Paranoid Schizophrenia. 

She no longer has friends and she has virtually zero relationship with any of her family (including me) because she is almost impossible to be around. My father still loves and supports her from a different house. She either pushes everyone away, or drives them crazy with her irrational antics.

She essentially lives by herself and takes over-the-top care of our old pets. Like hoarders are to keeping things as she is to caring for pets. That part isn't a big deal. She wants a divorce from him, but cant get one because she is mentally incompetent. She might actually want one but it could also just be part of the disease.

She has spoken about seeing spirits and lights and stuff in our house, accused my dad of working with the train companies to send her messages (we have tracks near our house) and often confronted us as adolescents accusing us of ""playing games with her."" She has also exhibited violent characteristics towards myself, my siblings, and my father.

Needless to say, I survived all of this and after much strife, my dad and little sister moved out of the house with her as well. (although for years she was still taking care of us as if she was fine) Everything is working out for the best except for her situation.

I love my mother, but she has essentially not existed since I was 12. She does NOT want to take medicine and was baker acted appointed a court guardian at one point to have her take it. She took it for a bit, was deemed competent, relieved of her guardian, stopped her meds, and started over. I feel like every day she isn't being helped, she is being robbed of her life, and in a little way I feel responsible that no one knows what to do and is therefor doing nothing. She is miserably lonely, but anytime anyone tries to help her she pushes them away.

I live in FL, and as far as my family can discern, there is nothing illegal about being psychotic. 

So what can I do? just accept the fact that she is stuck in this state of life? Its like a little part of her brain is holding her hostage from what could be a happy life. 

Part of me just wants to hold her hostage and force meds upon her in order to rescue her from herself. any advice? ","['dobj', 'dobj']",-1,neu_vader

I decided to go back, and I'm still thinking about cancelling the appointment because it makes me so nervous. But I've had a lot more problems develop since the last time I was there. I have no idea what to say or do. I don't feel like I could even begin to cover all of it.

I find myself questioning reality literally all day long. I have extremely vivid dreams every night and I get them confused with reality on a daily basis. I constantly have thoughts like ""I dreamed this, this already happened, etc."" Deja vu is a daily occurrence and I find myself overwhelmed by scary thoughts. I worry that everything is a dream and that nothing is real. I'm often overcome with this feeling that I'm not real, I don't know how to explain it though. I become very afraid of reality and basic things. I become terrified that I'm alive.

I have general anxiety disorder as well, and that's why I initially went to the psychologist. I have anxiety episodes every day as well and am currently on medication. It stopped working long ago though. Every day (usually at night) I have hours of panic and nausea for no reason at all. I just become so nervous about everything and hyperaware of my surroundings. I have extreme racing thoughts and am far too aware of everything.

I hate having these thoughts like ""I'm not real"" or ""this is all a dream."" It makes me feel like life is really pointless. I was diagnosed with major depression as well, but it seems to come and go. Honestly to me it feels more like bipolar, but that's another story for another time. Sometimes I'm not depressed at all. Lately I have been though.

Everything has a ""fantasy"" explanation for me. I see things from the corner of my eye a lot, and I'm paranoid of the people around me for no reason. I just feel so strange. I feel on edge all the time and I hate being human. I just hate it so much, it doesn't feel right. I have no idea what to say to the psychologist. I'm terrified to take other pills than what I'm already on. My vision feels weird a lot, I hear things that aren't there... I don't know why this has to happen to me.

I was always weird and lived in my own fantasy world, but it got a lot worse over the past few years. I'm 22 now. It seems like over the past year it's gotten a lot worse than it ever was. I feel like I'm very out of place in this world. None of that silly stuff like ""people don't like me, waaah."" I just feel WEIRD and wrong, like I don't exist and everything is pointless. I hate everything yet at the same time I don't care. 

I think life is pointless and when I look at my loved ones, all I can think of is how someday they'll be dead. These are really horrible thoughts to have.

Will they take me off my anti-anxiety medication(klonopin), and I'll be left totally raw and unprotected from the terror that are my emotions? I'm coping with them the best that I can..

I don't want to die. I wanna be happy, I want my girlfriend to love me, and I want my family to love me, but let's face it. I am 25 years old, and I am barely keeping it together. I cried for hours last night and my girlfriend was supportive of me, but how much of me can she take? I don't want to subject her to my batshit insanity if she has a better chance of being in a healthy relationship with someone else.

Which begs the question, ""Am I capable of providing a healthy relationship, or am I giving her more burdens than I should?"" Am I a burden? Should I kill myself? Will the voices go away, the voices telling me that I'm a bad person and that I should hurt myself? They don't really come around much anymore, but I am so afraid of hearing them again. I am so afraid of going to a psychiatric hospital again because they'll be mean to me and ponder permanent hospitalization.

And then I'll have my freedoms taken away, and they'll misgender me, and they'll call me a tranny again, and mock and deride me, and I don't want to deal with that again.

I'm constantly rationalizing to myself that they're all unsubstantiated delusions and hallucinations based upon selective observations/hearing, and although I'm not at all a violent person; I fear that this will hurt someone I care about if I pursue these delusions.  I know that the people I care about need to know about this however I'm sincerely afraid that I'll be rejected if I tell them and I'll live the rest of my life alone because of this.

My aunt (mother's sister) is alone, was never married, and lives near us in LA while the rest of our family is in NY. She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia ~15 years ago. After she was laid off in 2008, she lost her health insurance and stopped taking Haldol.

After her layoff, my mom offered to pay for her health insurance but she said she was feeling great and didn't need medication. When her COBRA ran out, she was 61 (she's 66 now), so it would have only been a few years until Medicare kicked in. Since then, she's been on a downward spiral. 

A couple years ago, she called me asking where I was, what I was doing, etc. -- as though she didn't remember anything about me. I called home and told my parents what was going on, and they went to her house with the crisis management team from the mental health department of Los Angeles. When they showed up at her door, my parents asked my aunt to talk to the team and she started yelling/screaming.

The assessment the team made was that she needed to be seen by a doctor, so they called the police. The police showed up, my parents opened the door with a spare key, and the police said that she could either get on the gurney or they would have to forcibly take her to the hospital. She went willfully.

She stayed in the hospital for 10 days and nothing came out of it -- they didn't feel that she was a danger to anyone or herself. After that, she stopped being the typical aunt that we knew. She rarely took phone calls, and when she did, she verbally abused whoever was calling.

A few months later, her apartment's management team called my parents saying that my aunt was throwing chairs in the pool. The crisis management gig happened again and this time, she stayed for 42 days in the hospital -- the maximum hold. They had to get court orders to inject her with various drugs, as she wouldn't take them willingly. Eventually she gave in and would take the drugs by mouth.

After the 42 day stay, the last drug they gave her stuck (don't remember the name) and she returned to normal -- she was sweet, cheerful, called everyone in the family, etc. She stopped taking the medications and then the spiral continued. I was the last person in my family to see her in person (I was least involved with the hospital ordeals, as I was away from college), and when we met up for lunch she cursed my whole family and said she never wanted to see anyone again.

Now, it's been about a year and we're getting calls from the apartment management saying that she's banging on vending machines, they hear her screaming in her apartment, etc. She has a god complex and feels that everyone needs to serve her. While she was in the hospital, my family found HUNDREDS of pages of notes of a world that she made up.

She didn't pay her phone bill so her line is now cut off; my parents are paying for the rest of her bills. I'm wondering what options my family has, as my aunt has no nuclear family of her own. I want to help my aunt and I feel that she should take the medications that turned her back to her normal self. How can we get conservatorship / power of attorney? Please let me know if you need more info. Thanks in advance for your time and help.

tl;dr My aunt is paranoid schizophrenic, has no family of her own, and has isolated herself. She's slowly spiraling downward and I'm worried that she's going to hurt herself / someone else. I'm wondering what the best options are to get her help. She will not talk to anyone in my family.","['dobj', 'dobj']",-1,neu_vader

So I guess my question is does anyone have experience recovering from schizophreniform disorder? 
Have you ever been successful in discontinuing antipsychotics?
Did you ever relapse?
Were you eventually diagnosed with schizophrenia?

I've read that 2/3 of people diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder develop schizophrenia. I guess I'm just hoping I'm the 1/3 who doesn't.

Due to believing I had ADHD. It had positives and negatives, the positives were; I had a feeling of ""I can do everything"" I could clean my house and do a good job at it. I could focus on what I needed to do.                                                                                                        The negatives were that it it doesn't last long and the crash is rough. Now, last week I had a Skype call with a psychiatrist expecting to be diagnosed with ADHD. He diagnozed me with schizophrenia instead. Basically telling me that the reason I haven't been able to get my life on track is because of schizophrenia.                                                 I think he misunderstood me with a few things. I mentioned to him that I had taken accutane when I was younger and that I had think it has caused a problem with my bones. (My joints and jaw cracks and sometimes locks up, it is painful) and that I often have a bad body odor that makes me anxious in public. I think he thought I was imagining these things (hallucinating/delusions) but it's all real. I have members that can attest. Anyway... I've been prescribed abilify 5mg.                The thing is.... I don't see things. (I see things at the corner of my eye when I don't sleep) I don't have voices harrasing me. I do talk to myself.. But.. In a normal way? I can get really paranoid when I'm walking with a bag and check behind my back to see if I've dropped anything.                                 If I smell i am constantly sniffing out of paranoia. (Because it's embarrassing) I have pretty excessive fatigue and often have insomnia. And lethargy and mood swings... I took Ritalin again today.. (I've been told not to) because my house was a mess and I'm sick of feeling overwhelmed by everything.                            I took the Ritalin and cleaned the kitchen (finally) and had a anxious feeling of excitement. It just feels awesome feeling CAPABLE of doing simple things like the dishes. Rather than avoiding it because it feels like a mountain to climb. I shouldn't be taking Ritalin.. But I don't know what to do. Without it I can't function.. I'm worried about taking the Abilify because I just am NOT sure if I have schizophrenia... I'm getting a second opinion hopefully SOON. There's been speculation that I might also be ADHD but I just don't know. I've hears the anti phsychotic medications mainly deal with the POSITIVE effects of schizophrenia... I don't have delusions. Besides being into government conspiracies.. But, I think that's pretty normal in this day and age.. We all know about the NSA and Snowden etc etc. It's not CRAZY. I don't hear things like what you'd hear in a schizophrenia simulation on YouTube. I'm worried if I DO have schizophrenia, the Abilify will exacerbate the NEGATIVE symptoms.. Which I suffer from. So.. Yea that's that I guess. There's a lot I left out but I'm literally writing down as I think. I'm still coming down from Ritalin .. So.. Things are just flowing...... I'll try and add spaces between paragraphs if I can, its difficult to do on my phone. Felt good to vent. Thanks.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

My brother was ran over by a gravel truck in January of 2004(he was 16 I was 10) and my mom started having me go to child psychologists/therapists to help me cope. I was diagnosed with chronic depression and I took medications for it off and on for the following six years as well as went to different types of therapy and such throughout that time.


My possible schizophrenic activity began around the same time but I believed I was just coping in my own way. Now, understand I have always been an optimistic person both in demeanor and in thought process. I didn't cry in front of anyone at the time because everyone else seemed like they were so sad and needed me to be strong. Especially my mother. So I bottled all my emotions as much as I could and never cried in front of anyone.


The schizophrenic activity that I believe began around that time is that I had started to imagine my brother was walking with me down to the bus stop like he always had and I would have conversations as if reversing them with an imaginary friend (I believe these were normal for a child coping with the loss of a loved one) the thing that wasn't normal, I think, was that I would imagine walking into fast, ongoing traffic, pushing others into traffic or off ledges, among other things. I never acted out on these thoughts though but there was always a voice inside me that suggested them.


Skipping forward to my freshman year of highschool. My brother had died as a freshman and that thought, as I walked the halls he had last been in alive, brought on a whole new wave of my depression. It weakened my mental strength. I cried in the one class where no one would be friendly to me and had to frequently excuse myself to go to the councilor'ss office.


That year was also when I believe my schizophrenia got worse. At the time I had believed I had some sort of multiple personality disorder because there were two voices that seemed to distinguish themselves with certain personalities and they would ""take over"" and do what they did.


While in this state I had pulled scissors on a bully. He'd been bullying me all year and managed to make the entire class bully me as well. I'm not one that would normally resort to violence and I got off practically Scott free while he was the one that got in trouble. (The teachers liked me in my highschool because I was a good student and a well mannered kid.)


Another time I had kissed a few random strangers and acted much like a well-practiced seductress (I am far from that). I had slapped one of my closest friends extremely hard out of no where too.


After two years of dealing with the voices and the troubles they caused and influenced me to do they just suddenly vanished.


I realized a year after that that I didn't have multiple personalities and instead had something similar to schizophrenia. I realized I had an extreme paranoia of being watched, believing that if my door was shut that no one could see me but if it were open then I was always under watch. (That way of thinking had been there since almost a year after my brother's death) Everyone could hear what I was thinking, I wasn't safe when near white vehicles of any sort. I still don't think I'm safe near white vehicles and I think I'm going to die because of a white vehicle. Unfortunately, all my family has owned are white vehicles since this sudden realization came to me.


Earlier last year my hallucinations began to take a turn for the worst. I would hear noises such as animal calls, car noises, trains, and people calling for me when no such thing was around me and no one else would hear them. It got even worse when I would hear deep whispers saying ""Hey!"" or ""Over here!"" from behind me and I'd turn around to no one being there.


I had a schizophrenic attack(a term I probably came up with) during my second semester at college this year in spring. Where all I could see was this face that haunts me and there was so many voices shouting in my head and talking all at once that I just had to put loud music in my ears and close my eyes, willing it all to go away. I've only ever had one of those before this and it wasn't quite that bad.


Since May of this year I have had to sleep with my bathroom light on because the scary hallucinations of that haunting face as well as other figures keep showing up in the dark. I see figures standing in the trees around my house, I saw something trying to grab at my leg from under my boyfriend's car a couple months back, I've even held people back from going into someplace because I could see something there and I didn't want them getting hurt.


These hallucinations scare me. Earlier this evening I suddenly had to back away from my desk because I felt there was something underneath it and it was going to grab my legs and scratch them up. When I backed away and looked underneath there was clearly nothing there. But I felt so much in danger that I didn't go back to my desk for a while. I'm currently typing this all from my tablet (so please forgive any typos I might've missed).


I cannot see a psychiatrist/psychologist/therapist right now because I don't have the time, money, or transportation to do so. Although I do have distinct paranoia and hallucinations both audible and visual, I don't know if this qualifies me to have any certain type of schizophrenia or if I just have multiple other things that are wrong with me. I looked into night terrors earlier and that seemed similar to the paranoia I feel at night.


It also may be noteworthy that I'm an artist. I've been on medication before that made me stop thinking at night and helped me go to sleep faster, but that also stunted my creativity tremendously. This is another reason I don't want to go to a psychiatrist. I don't want to have to give up my creativity just so that I can be more normal.","['dobj', 'pobj']",-1,neu_vader

In February of 2010 my mother suddenly ""snapped"" one night and completely lost it. I was in my room playing video games when my dad busted in and started frantically telling me that my mother had just started yelling incoherently at him. She then ran out the door and took off down the street by foot. We live in a state that's very cold and snowy around that time of year, so we knew something was very wrong and that we had to find my mom and bring her back inside ASAP.

So we went out and started searching the neighborhood for her. Since she was on foot and my dad and I were driving we quickly caught up to her. We jumped out of the car and began chasing her down which resulted in a wild goose chase of hopping fences, running through people's backyards, and darting across busy roads. Despite my dad and I both being pretty athletic my mom managed to lose us.

Completely bewildered and with absolutely no idea what to do next we returned home and called 911. Not a minute after hanging up with the police I looked out the window and saw my mom lurking in the backyard. My dad went out and was able to convince her to come inside.

The police showed up and my dad, not sure of what to do, told them they just had an argument and nothing else. So the cops saw that nobody had any physical signs of abuse and left.

We then tried talking to my mom and asking her what was wrong. She yelled and accused us of mocking, ridiculing, and laughing at her, which was not true. It didn't stop there though, she began to spew all kinds of insane situations and events that were almost laughable because of how ridiculous it all sounded. 

We eventually convinced her to go to the ER with us which led to an incredibly long and stressful night. She was prescribed an anti-anxiety med and was given a referral to see a mental health specialist the next day where she was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

The next two years were very difficult at times but eventually led to improvement and at my mom's request was told she could stop taking her meds. 

She was able to start working again, bought a new car, and went out with her friends on the weekends. We could always tell she wasn't who she used to be though, I don't know if there's any way to come back from what she went through.

Unfortunately things have been going downhill very quickly these past couple of weeks. She's having the same delusions again accompanied by fierce anger and the worst stubbornness I've ever experienced. We've been making doctor's appointments and trying to get her new prescriptions but she flat out absolutely refuses to do anything we ask her. Since she isn't a physical threat at this point (thankfully) we have no legal way to force her to see the doctor or get any help.

At this point we've just become completely exhausted with trying to reason with her and have no idea what to do next. Is there anything I can do to reach through to her? Do we have any means to make her see a doctor or start taking her prescriptions? 

I apologize for how long this has become but I've never told anybody about this and had no idea where to start. I really appreciate any help you guys can offer.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

Currently I'm on a really low dose of Abilify (5mg), with Buspar and Vistaril as needed for anxiety and sleep, respectively. I'm really happy with this set-up, as I hatehatehate being heavily medicated. It doesn't block out all the psychosis, social anxiety, etc. but it's a trade-off I'm willing to live with so I don't have to deal with horrid side effects.

Anyway, my girlfriend and I both suffer from mental health issues (she bipolar type I, me either schizoaffective or bipolar type I with psychosis...), so we tend to be pretty private people. We live together in an apartment, and I've tried to make friends with the neighbors with varying degrees of success. This is a defense mechanism I've learned; I ration that if I *know* the neighbors and talk to them on a regular basis, they'd feel more comfortable coming to me with any problems they have, and this makes me feel a little more at ease. My girlfriend, on the other hand, doesn't want anything to do with the neighbors, and I respect this. We keep the blinds closed pretty much 24/7 and are generally private people when we're home.

However, one of my biggest fears (and my girlfriend and everyone I've ever known has assured me it's just my psychosis) is that my neighbors hate me, are constantly complaining about me, calling the cops on me, or complaining to the landlord, etc. etc.... Part of this is related to the fact that I used to be addicted to meth 5 or 6 years ago, and I guess I never really got over the paranoia and guilt associated with my addiction. Anyway... I'll try to make a long story short.

Lately my psychosis and anxiety have been peaking a lot, but there are some real-world facts that are causing this. First, I know that keeping my blinds closed 24/7 makes people suspicious of me, as I've been to forums where people complain about their ""suspicious"" neighbors. Also, one of the neighbors (a young Latino dude whose whole family lives in various apartments around the complex) told me about how his family ""doesn't look for trouble but likes to protect the neighborhood"" and they accused this other guy of stealing one of the kids bikes, and intimidated him into paying for it. I eventually met the accused, and he was the nicest, most soft-spoken, nerdy stoner kid you'll ever meet. He was kind of a hermit, stayed inside playing video games with the windows shut, and I really doubt he stole the bike, but they threatened him into paying for it anyway. 

That was a few months ago right when I moved in. Now, lately, my gf and I both took some time off from work and have been rarely leaving the house. The other day, as I was leaving to go somewhere, one of the kids started loudly rattling the gate on the pool, like the *second* I opened the door. As I walked down the steps he ran away up to the Latino dude (and his dad's) apartment, and yelled ""Grandpa, grandpa, down here!!!"" as I was riding off on my bike. When I returned, walking with my girlfriend, a couple of the older kids were skateboarding out front and ran into the complex; when I walked into the courtyard, ""grandpa"" was standing on his stoop. I waved at him and tried to make brief small talk, but he just smiled awkwardly and pantomimed like he couldn't hear me.

Anyway, now I'm lightweight freaking out that they think I'm up to something or have beef with me. I have no idea, though.

Also, maybe unrelated, but I started searching around forums about apartments and troublesome neighbors, and found this link: http://www.kci.org/meth_info/msg_board_posts/041506/Suspicious%20of%20Meth%20lab%20in%20apartment.htm

Now, if you read the first post, almost EVERY bullet point could apply to me:

-Smoke alarm going off: this actually happened to me, I had taken the alarm off the wall and set it on my desk to change the batteries, then later I smoked a bowl of weed and accidentally set it off. heh

-Hearing people but lights off: my girlfriend and I often lie in bed talking for a long time before we fall asleep

-Charcoal on the ground: not sure about this, but I do smoke cigarettes on the landing outside our bedroom window

-Windows covered with blankets: our bedroom window *is* covered with a blanket because we haven't had a chance to buy blackout curtains, and it's the one that most prominently faces the inner courtyard

-Random waking hours: like I said, we got laid off and I'm working from home, so we don't have a set schedule

-Not ""high traffic"" but odd: we have different friends come over maybe every week or so...

-Chronic coughing: our neighbor on the other side coughs *LOUD* all the time

-Lighters clicking: I do smoke (cigarettes) and occasionally marijuana, but not too often

-Conversations about drug use: my gf and I are both addicts, and she occasionally jokes about it (she talks much louder than I do, because of my paranoia I speak quietly)

-Conversation about a local family: I live in a relatively small town and my father is pretty damn well known; I've also made a couple scenes back when I was on drugs, and also in my mental illness, and rumors/reputations have a way of getting around... our family certainly aren't bad people, but my father and I are both odd/quiet types (plus a few weird outbursts in public from me), and clearly people are suspicious of people like that...

I dunno, sorry for the huge wall of text, but I just needed to get it out there somehow. I'm sure the link was just a coincidence, but it made me more conscious of how people gossip and get suspicious (notice how *everyone* at the link was like ""YUP, definitely meth cooks living next to you!"")

Anyway. If anyone actually reads this, thanks for taking the time. I'm not really looking for suggestions or advice, just venting, but they are welcome nonetheless.


*TL;DR:* I think my neighbors think I'm up to something, like I'm a drug dealer or meth cook or something, because I'm such an awkward, private person, and this agitates my psychosis and paranoia :[

I am not sure if I'm just overly sensitive to the medications (yeah, yeah, who isn't?!), but I just am not capable of sustaining anything resembling normalcy on them. In fact, they make me feel worse.

The Seroquel (900 mgs) gave me gnarly heart palpitations. The weird thing is that I took this medication for more than a year before they began. I honestly thought the medication was going to kill me; it worsened my paranoia. I was not too thrilled about sleeping a good portion of the day away or the weight gain, but I was able to work around it. I finally had to say *no mas* due to the heart palpitations and my heightened fears from them.

I then tried Geodon (60 mgs). I thought I had found the anti-psychotic for me in Geodon, but after two to three months I became extremely disassociated and dizzy. I could not stand for more than five minutes at a time, and I felt as if I was looking through someone else's eyes. I was in bed all day, propped up watching Netflix and listening to podcasts. Ultimately, I found myself in the ER exhibiting symptoms associated with brain lesions. Thankfully the CT scan showed that I did not have a lesion like they suspected, and they and my psychiatrist chalked it up to the Geodon. Throughout it all I still had frequent auditory hallucinations.

Then it was on to Abilify (15 mgs). It played out like the Geodon before: I saw improvements for the first several months, and then I was hit with crippling dizziness and disassociation. Like the others before, I was experiencing auditory hallucinations while on the medication. 

Now, I am not taking anything but Ativan and Paxil. I have found that if I can regulate my anxiety, then I can somehow keep my hallucinations and paranoid thoughts to a level that I feel is manageable. I still have to occasionally go to the ER when I am freaking out, but I can live with that momentary embarrassment and hypochondria far more than I could with the side effects of the anti-psychotics. 

Are others here able to attain more normalcy without the drugs than while on them? I am hoping to be back in school this upcoming summer semester, and I do not believe I would have ever been capable of doing so on any of the anti-psychotics I was on.

So here: I've experienced visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, delusions and memory loss so extreme I forgot who I was. Delusions took hold after my memory loss. scary stuff. I made a serious attempt on my own life and that action has left a lot of scaring. In the aftermath as I tried to pick up the pieces, there was a lot of confused thinking. Also what I can only convey as an extreme degradation of cognitive function. I was kept on suicide watch for several days in the mental health ward, and I have to say those places are fucking terrible. If you ever find yourself in a mental ward you basically have no rights. Also scary stuff. Anyway I was put on rispederal, and I complied with the medication. I got fat, lost all motivation, grew boobs... and nearly lactated, almost developed diabetes, and to top it all off it didn't affect my delusions or my auditory hallucinations. Fuck that drug. Its my personal opinion that it should be banned. Anyway I tried a new medication, this time it was abilify, and I had better results with that med. The only thing left bothering me after being on that drug for a year, were my auditory hallucinations. 

I decided to do some research into how to overcome this fucked up affliction, I came across a multitude of interesting articles on how countries that did not have the budget to supply AP's had higher success rates of people getting better from SZ. So I brought up the notion with my pdocs and nurses. I didn't want to be on chemically mind altering AP's for the rest of my life, and that I wanted to gradually decrease my dosage. I wanted to wean myself off the meds in a safe manner. They heard me out, and I was successful in reducing my meds safely. I got a job, saved up some money and got my own place. bla bla bla. I'm now basically recovered, and scraping by fairly well.

but you know what? One thing has always persisted, my auditory hallucinations, voices. They were terrible, not a moments rest. holyshit! The things I had to hear. I got fed up and one night decided to smoke a joint, I just wanted to escape you know? Anyway, I don't recommend smoking weed under those circumstances, voices sober are pretty bad but high haha, that was a baaaad trip. Anyway I nearly broke down and cried that night I was tripping so hard, but I held it together and retreated into meditation. Meditation under those circumstances is really quite hard when you have counted over a dozen different voices bouncing around in your skull. So I started focusing on those voices, if I couldn't make them stop, maybe I could do the next best thing... control them. Now this is really hard to explain, but I'll give it a shot. I focused on my brain, felt it out with my mind. I used my pulse that was pounding through and around my skull to try and, well... get a feel for it.. my brain. I figured since its internal and it is my brain after all... that if some ppl have the amazing ability to calm themselves into slowing their pulse, that's basically in some small way controlling an automated organ. I just figured hmmm, maybe I could do the same thing for my fuckin brain. Anyway there I was multi tasking, listening to these auditory hallucinations, trying to feel my brain, and stay calm and rational in this blitzed out condition.

I tried to apply several visual techniques to try and ground these voices somewhere in my mind, so I would have some basis with which to control them, or at least access them. I wanted to create a foundation where I knew they were coming from. because if your SZ you get to experience first fucking hand that these voices can seem to come from anywhere. So yeah. At this point I was getting excited because in my mind instead of the voices coming from the tv or the radio or outside, they were now rooted in my skull.

I started to reach out after accomplishing that feat, I wanted to shut them up. I forgot to mention this earlier but the voices were such assholes that they wanted me to shut up. Like, can you imagine voices telling you that your thinking too loudly, anyway... I did end up losing my inner voice, and I haven't gotten it back yet to this date.

So I'm reaching out..into?? my mind to settle a score. I figured enough is enough. I have an idea where you are, time to step up. So little by little like a spider sitting on its web; I started to feel the individual vibrations each distinct voice was giving off in my mind. At this point now that I've grounded these auditory hallucinations somewhere in my consciousness. It was now time to follow those lines and sink my mental fangs into these buzzing mental assholes. I started with the most antagonistic of the voices. and so like a puppet master I attempted to take control. I summed up where I felt the voice was originating from, felt what seemed like its essence in my mind and forcefully and with purpose made the blasted thing say what i wanted.. Its hard to put into words what I got the voices to say in the beginning. It was slow going and to tell the truth a little painful. it was like learning how to read and write again, with extreme ADD but I did it. The voices were saying what I wanted. In fact experimenting with these new pathways I seem to have engraved into my mind. I was able to get them all saying the same thing at the same time. It actually scared the pants off me. The more I practiced the better I got at it. When reading a book now I could apply different voices to different charters in whatever novel I was reading. I could have any song I wanted sung to me, mind you I'd have to remember the lyrics. It was something.. if the voices ever said something I didn't like I could now take control and sometimes stop the audio hallucination, or at least make it more pleasant... it literally saved my sanity. On a happy side note I had a problem with all of the male voices, and I was able to block them all out. So now it's all female voices. Its really weird, but much less abrasive to my mind at least.

ah but there is always a drawback isn't there? Well here is mine. I got so use to it and so good at it that I was doing it subconsciously now. I barely ever smoke weed anymore btw. but it was now my reality that the voices were now saying everything that poped into my head! To be honest it sucks, you have no idea how fucked up it is to have every thought repeated back at you, sometimes right away and other times.. well its like delayed feedback I might think something, hear it right away, and then hear the eco of it again. quite madding. However it has made me more conscious of who I am as a person and who I want to become. 

If you think it's better this way for you as a fellow SZer. here is a tip that helped me better control the speech of my auditory hallucinations. I have found that purely thinking about what I want them to say works most of the time. However in the beginning I want you to think back to your preschool days when you were learning how to read. Your teachers would go through the sound certain grouping of letters made like sh ah wo ed etc. and you would formulate words from those grouping of letters. Go over that again in your mind because this is very much like learning how to read again, but this time its reading your own subconscious thoughts. You have to learn how to control what being processed in your mind. So imagine a mental 'imaginary' tongue in your mouth; you can move your very real tongue while learning how to pronounce these words in your mind. ok?.. You are going to be saying these words in your mind but with force and a purpose! and i find that using your tongue to assist in this form of speech helps because it seems logical to me that you are tapping into the part of your brain that is usually active while using your tongue. its kinda like a life hack for people with SZ to tap into your ability to control your inner speech, because trust me, your thoughts are flying around in your mind so quickly you might not even know your thinking them. Many are subconscious. If this works for you like it did for me.. you are going to have to deal with audible urges lust disgust opinions you never thought you had, fuck man the list goes on... One cool thing about this is. If I'm correct about my idea about using your tongue to help tap into the area of your brain that stimulates speech, and hopefully that of auditory hallucinations, it brings new meaning to the belief that the tongue is the strongest muscle in our bodies. Anyway I hope this ability to control auditory hallucinations can be reproduced in your minds as it has in mine. :)

I am also physically in peak fitness. I would like for all of this to stay this way. But I have never been tested for anything.  I'm coming here today, to ask what you think, and I have some questions as well.
If you are tested and diagnosed, is there a record this? Who finds out, and Are you held To legally abide with medication?. Or are you going to be Held against your will? I only ask because I have a working life and a social life and I cannot commit to that, Nor do I need to.

I consider myself a very paranoid person. I am always on edge over everything and everyone. I realize anyone who claims that they themselves feel crazy, are definitely not crazy. I've never felt crazy. I feel completely normal, Even though I am not, Nor is anyone really. The truth is I don't want anyone to know, if I am schizophrenic  . The last thing I need in life is To have people disregard me as crazy. But I do want to know for myself. Can a doctor scan my brain and tell me? Or is it some therapy thing? I also don't want to pay a great deal if it doesn't benefit me at all.

In the past year I have experienced on four known occasions, hallucinations. One visual, three audial. I don't know if that's a lot, or a little. One of those was a traumatic one. I will spare you the details, they are irrelevant, but once I discovered what I was sensing and hearing was not real, it faded away and I am left  considering what had or why it had happened. Sometimes I hear music too, and suddenly realize nothing is playing but I don't consider this a hallucination. My audio hallucinations were arguments about me, so I guess that's a paranoid hallucination. I am told I have dissociative drawing patterns and thinking. I do not think I am a sociopath because I have empathy and feelings torwards everyone. I do not remember since when, but I over analyze others dispositions and motives torwards me to the point where I cannot remain with them or friends with them for very long. My longest relationship was 3 months and ended embarrassingly for me.

I read what you all have to say in other threads, and now I'm worried because I feel similar. Constant exhaustion for no reason. A compulsive feeling to die or commit suicide despite no real underlying depression. Hallucinations. Paranoid thoughts. That sort of thing, all hours of the day.

Key fact in all this, she thinks that they think the murder was done by magic. She thinks that by ""triggering"" her with particular words they can use her responses to prove she did it and thus have her put in prison. She is deathly serious about it, cannot be convinced of how absurd it sounds and spends her days in a state of abject terror.

She knows they are doing this because of snippets of conversation that sound innocuous to me as well as because of ""hearing"" the neighbours talking through the wall (doesn't seem to be any evidence that she actually did but if she did I am guessing just more innocuous bits of conversation she has read her fears into).

I really don't know what to do. She used to accept that it sounded absurd and occasionally say she wondered if she was just mad. Now she is sure she is right and that I am ""in denial"" because I don't want to face up to the plot. She thinks that all the changes to legal aid the government are putting through are being done specifically to make it easier to put her in prison.

My dad doesn't want to force her to go to see a doctor because she would interpret it as a betrayal and he couldn't bear to have her think that about him. He hopes its just the menopause making her feel this way and that it will die down once her hormones calm down.

I am worried that it will last the rest of her life and that the sooner we deal with it the less time she will be miserable for.

But, I am worried about forcing her to see a doctor because:  
1. I don't really want her to think I betray her either.  
2. I think the doctor will take 6 months to even refer her to someone who can actually help and in the mean time she will come up with some ridiculous escape plan (she has been talking about moving to a different country where the law can't find her).  
3. I am worried that the side effects of any kind of medication will make her as miserable as she is now but in a different way.  

I am very frustrated, I can't help but argue with her ridiculous beliefs because I hope that by seeing that I don't accept there is any chance they could be real she will realise she is not thinking straight. It doesn't work, I know it by now, but I still seem to get into arguments over it which makes her sad.

I am moving out very soon (planned before all this flaired up) and dad works away a lot. I am worried about her being left alone in this state of mind.

I remember not being able to ever sleep at night because of the fear of someone breaking into the house. I would have reoccurring nightmares of intruders breaking into our house and would always seek safety in my parents bedroom...which they allowed until I was much too old. I probably got over that fear when I was 12-14 or so (just a rough guess...as this is going back quite a ways since I am 26 now).

The fears and anxieties stayed away a long, long time until like any curious, middle-class, college student I started trying various drugs. First was marijuana which I started smoking regularly my senior year of high school until about my senior of college, I also tried DXM around 20 or so times in highschool...all very positive experiences with the euphoria of being connected to the world. I haven't done DXM in 6+ years and I quit marijuana three or so years ago I have dabbled occasionally..usually with a negative experience but a few times it was somewhat positive and hopeful.

Going into the summer of my senior year of college we discovered a mushroom field where purple ringers or Ps. Cubensis. grew frequently. Those following three months we tripped on mushrooms anywhere from 30-50 times. 95% of the experiences were beautiful and blissful...absolute joy. I had 2 ""bad trips"". One was what I now know was a panic attack and I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I got through that and another was very similar...were I had a paranoid thought about the buddy I was tripping with, sort of along the lines of what if he did something to the mushrooms. I was able to dismiss this thought very easily because we had all tripped together and he is my best friend but the fact that i had such a thought upsetted me a bit.

Queue, my final college year (2010) where I have had somewhat good marks, was on my way to getting a bachelor of science and was a four year member of the college soccer team. I started getting anxiety attacks and had to quit the soccer team. I was then up one night watching TV and a show about Steven Hawking came on and how he got ALS and it described all the symptoms. That night I managed to convince myself that I was in the beginning stages of ALS; and all the symptoms associated it with started to show itself. The mind is an amazing piece of machinery; but if you allow it too have free reign while you are in a highly anxious state; it'll bring your worst fears to life. This is when I started suffering from full on medical student syndrome...anything negative that I read on google (and believe me I research and research until i can't research anymore)  I convince myself I have...the list of medical illness I have ""had go from MS, ALS, Tumors, Cancer, etc.

I dropped out of my senior year of school and went to the doctor who convinced me i didn't have ALS and offered some anxiety medication which I refused. Around this time is when I got my first intrusive thought. I was out fishing on the boat with my dad and saw a knife on the boat and the thought or image of stabbing my dad popped into my head. This caused me tremendous alarm and pain...I couldn't realize why I would have such a thought. It kept me up for nights on end and I was too embarrassed to tell anyone about it...On a few occasions I thought I was going insane...I fought this with working out. knowing that I was a good person deep down and fighting off the thoughts (which I realize now wasn't the proper way of going about it). I hated being around knifes in the kitchen and would not be near them...just looking at one would cause tremendous anxiety. I went to community college and took a few classes then transferred back to  my original college and finished off my degree. Around this time I also had miniature bouts of Schizo-OCD, I remember one time I went to the fridge and was going poor some milk and thought what if my mom poisoned it? I shrugged it off and drank it anyway and now I don't ever think of such things (except now that I read your blog its fresh in my mind so I have a feeling next time I eat with my gf that worry or thought will pop up. The joys of an OCD mind right!)

While I was away at college my anxiety went away for the most part due to the tremendous work load that comes with a computer science thesis. Around this time I got my first episode of HOCD; all the while had a great gf. I had a good friend who I would always shoot pool with and throw a couple of beers back. One day a thought popped into my head that I was sexually attracted to him and this tormented for me 1-2 months until I somehow managed to get over it. Maybe I just knew deep down that I wasn't? I'm not sure...

After finishing school I lived with my gf for a few months and everything was dandy; then I moved back home and got a job where I have currently been working for 3 years. When I moved back home the intrusive thoughts of hurting loved ones came back...this time it was more focused on my mother and not my dad. They tormented me day and night and caused many restless nights again. Along with this I had very real health anxiety concerns....thought my heartbeat was irregular so went to the doctor and had an EKG/stress test etc... (approx 2 1/2+ years ago).

Around this time was my first bout to de-personalization (which I believe was due to my body/mind being continuously on edge ; which was scary in its own right. But with a positive mindset, time, some self-help books and patience I was able to get over it and get back to my real self in a short amount of time.

Since then I have convinced myself I have MS due to eye floaters (insisted on getting a MRI scan despite seeing 3-4 eye doctors that said I was okay)...have had a sore throat that lasted for like 10 months which I was sure due to cancer of some sort. Went to multiple specialists all who said it was acid reflux, etc...that eventually cleared up when I met a beautiful girl who I have been in a relationship with for six months now.

When I entered the relationship with her I was suffering from the sore throat but after spending time with her and getting my mind off of it it miraculously went away (this was after being burdened by it for 12+ months). I think my anxiety was keeping my sore throat alive. 

When I really started to fall in love with this chick which was about 3 months ago; the HOCD about her started to appear and tremendously troubled me again. I had read enough about them at this point that I was able to let them go and not worry about them too much...but a few times they really got the best of me. One time was when we were laying in bed together and she looked at me and said ""I know I'm going to marry you,"" and a thought of hurting her popped into my head. I'm embarrassed of even going into details because it troubled me so greatly. Then I had ROCD with her, worrying that I wasn't attracted to her and that I didn't find her pretty or that she wasn't the one.

She is stunning so the fact that I have these thoughts was extremely silly but they still bothered me...because I didn't want to lose this amazing feeling.

Eventually I got over that and we were hanging out and she said she would love to smoke weed with me. It had been about 6 months since I had smoked at this point and we had been together about 4 months now. The last time I smoked I was consumed by Harm OCD thoughts about my mother...so yeah it was a terrible experience previously. But I wanted to be a cool boyfriend and I don't like to fear anything because I believe the natural things such as weed and mushrooms; if used correctly; will bring a persons fear to the forefront of their mind where it can't be ignored so we can face them and get over them. We smoked weed together for about two weeks in which my anxiety was all over the place...some days it was non existent and some days the intrusive thoughts couldn't be ignored. 

After this I got my first case (around a month ago) of an alarming I thought what happened if she isn't in this relationship for the best of me and wants me to lose my mind? Completely silly thought and I know she just wants to have fun and experience the simple pleasures in life. But the fact that I had the thought scared me greatly, and I worried that I may someday believe that thought (OCD kicking in...even though I know i wouldn't).

Then around a month ago we went to a music festival together and we went ate mushrooms together (this was the first time I had done this in 4+years). We spent the evening walking around the park; having a beautiful time and really poured our souls to one another. She told me about all kinds of experiences in life she had...and I told her about my anxiety and my HOCD thoughts which she was very supportive of and completely 100% accepting. 

Then the following week my brain went into overdrive and tried convincing myself I have schizo. I was doing all kinds of personality tests; etc to see if i could have it. And the more I read the more I worry I have it...hence stumbling upon your site. I'm still struggling with the thoughts of what if my gf isn't in this for the best of me...etc. I know this to be false because her actions prove otherwise...but the thought bothers me and I don't want a thought ruining our relationship. I try to practice mindfulness and let the thoughts go which have been somewhat beneficial but I'm still worried I'll never look at her with the same. 

About three weeks ago I also had a tremendously scary thought of ""What if I only find pleasure in life by hurting people?"". This made me want to vomit and run away as fast as I could... I believe the thought caused me so much anxiety and pain because I had been in a hyper-aware state for about 2 weeks. Basically I have come to the conclusion that my anxiety changes ""faces"" and addresses the things I am most scared of and when I face the anxiety and conquer it, it just manifests itself into some other fear. 

For the past month and foreseeable future I have vowed not to drugs again, or smoke pot. I don't drink more than two beers when out. Currently I am meditating, running around 3 miles a day, and on a healthy diet. No caffeine, processed sugar, wheat, dairy, etc.

I have felt a lot better lately but yesterday I made the mistake of going on a ""google binge"" and then worrying and worrying some more until I felt like I was going to break.

Keep in mind throughout all this I have been working my way up via promotions in my job. I work as a wholesale broker for a company in FL, which unfortunately allows me to google to my hearts content when it is slow :( ha! I have been practicing letting the thoughts pass and just being a good person. I truly believe I am a good person and this is an opportunity to learn about my fears and when I overcome them I would love to help people that have similar issues. I want to make the world a better place, but first I suppose I need to help myself. I have the courage to face this, and I am confident I will overcome this eventually. I won't let this define me as a person.

Thanks for reading all of this...


Any helpful advice or your opinions would be greatly appreciated :)

I have two good friends who are also chronic paranoid schizophrenic men. We are all very similar.  We have the same cluster of symptoms, very strong positive symptoms, low negative symptoms and heightened aggression that crosses the line into psychopathic behavior.  We are all aware of how messed up we are.  I am the highest functioning, while one of my friends is high functioning and the other is moderate, he has no occupation.  I am in the middle of my fifth semester on academic scholarship, I have a free education.  I am also obsessed with working out, I have done all sorts of physical activities, martial arts, powerlifting, bodybuilding.  

But anyways, we all take medications, a solid handful of different medications.  Im on two antipsychotics, a benzodiazapine and a beta blocker. 

We all show signs of psychopathic deviance.  I was formally evaluated, took the MMPI-2 and yep I scored in the pathological range, my two friends have never taken the MMPI-2 but they exhibit psychopathic tendencies like repeated offenses of drunk driving.  

Two of us are very disturbed and have violent and sexual fantasies as well as vivid dreams and nightmares featuring grotesque things like being tortured, killing people, ect.  The other is a combat veteran and has trauma and insomnia, he is disturbed by our thoughts. 

Well the two of us who function are indeed very disturbed.  We view our psychosis as a challenge and have our things we tell ourselves, like ""Pussies give in"", ""what doesnt kill me only makes me stronger"", and ""skullfuck schizophrenia"" (that's my quote).  We both have very uncannily similar cases.  We're both university students, we met at school.  We have deviant personalities, are both bisexual, both listen to the same music even, it's uncanny. We both have a history of alcohol abuse, I quit smoking but used to be a pack a day smoker, my friend still smokes two packs a day, we both drink coffee like water, and our main obsessions are sex and violence.  

Yes, we both constantly engage in sex or aggressive behaviors like lifting weights.  I have an alpha male superiority complex mixed with delusions of grandeur, I have Truman's Syndrome.  I lift weights a lot.  I take sex whenever it comes my way, attractive man or woman.  He has a girlfriend who he has been with for almost four years and still has sex with men from time to time. We both get irate when our symptoms are going rampant.  Hallucinations and delusions make us extremely angry and we are both on beta blockers to keep our blood pressure down. 

The thing is, we both function very highly and are success stories for other schizophrenics. 

We are inspirations to other schizophrenics and are models of recovery come true.  We know that we are and feel unlike other schizophrenics, we often say that those who do not function like normal people are derogatory adjectives like ""pussies"" and when we complain to each other saying that we are losing control, we often say things like ""nut up."" in response.  

We take pride in being what we call ""the accursed"".  We say that normal people cannot handle schizophrenia and that we are stronger than everyone else. When we are left alone with each other, we often unleash inappropriate behavior like screaming while driving.  


It makes me think that this illness is in some cases not exactly maladaptive. I mean paranoid schizophrenics with low negative symptoms and aggressive/psychopathic/dominant tendencies.  We are stereotypical madmen, without major tranquilizers we are raving mad, believe me on that.  


If we were born in a different millennia, we would have most certainly have been warriors.  At the age of 17 I was lifting weights, earned a few belts in Krav Maga and was in incredible shape.  Now I am on a handful of downers morning and night, and I still lift weights and am very muscular and know what I am doing, I was a competitive powerlifter for a while but got kicked off the team for calling the other lifters ""not too bright and sort of fat."" while they called me ""faggot"" and ""motherfucker"".

So maybe one of you will be able to input something helpful.

I should preface this by saying that I have had diagnoses of bipolar and schizophrenia in the past year and a half (soon after I turned 18). When I had my first manic episode I thought that I was unraveling the secrets to the universe. Looking back now I realize that it was a mixed bag of actual insight and stupid associations of people I had relationships with to different icons or physical phenomena. This was all prompted by me hearing voices for the first time and having minor visual hallucinations (or matrix glitches as I see them).

After a few institutionalizations and the loss of all of my ""friends"" I have found a place of stabilization. 

Now I am confronted with the problem of having constant voices who either are people that are in my life or are pretending to be. My theory is that there are some people that I used to hangout with that have the ability to split a part of their consciousness and direct its attention to me so that they can see what I'm doing and make fun of me all the while stealing a metaphysical currency from me and trying to shape me into being some sort of pet for them. This does sound very far fetched but there is so much evidence that has led me to this theory that it's impossible to ignore. 

For me (who now works 40 hours a week and is around people all the time) the biggest problem in my social life is that I can tell that some people know what I'm thinking and can hear what the voices are saying too. It's a constant struggle to try and explain myself mentally so that people around me that can hear me don't think that I am an awful person. I keep trying to figure out how to quiet myself so that I don't attract so much attention.

I feel that I am in between being fully conscious and dead asleep/ignorant. It seems to me that the only things holding me back are the entities that present themselves as voices and sometimes figures in my mind. They tell me that they are going to continue possessing me and keeping me locked down until I commit suicide (which I would like to do by cannot follow through with due to the love and concern that I have for my family).

I feel like I'm on the edge of discovering the backdoors of reality and that I could access them if it weren't for these people/things that are hell bent on controlling me.

I try to mediate sometimes but it is very difficult with all of the distractions. I have thought about going to an exorcist and seeing if that would help. I guess I am just feeling very stuck mentally and need help developing myself. I know that I am not fully awake yet and I don't know how to wake up. I didn't know if you guys have any suggestions or resources that you could lead me to. 

And I realize that my ideas will probably get a lot of shit because people don't usually talk about these things.
This being said, any insight would be so fucking appreciated.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

The problem for me at least is that the voices sound so real it's been hard to convince myself some of the things I've heard have been a hallucination. I've never been alone and heard a voice. It always happens in public. I'll hear someone talking to someone else, and whether they're actually talking or not the voices I hear are their voices as a hallucination, if that makes sense. I can also be in a room and hear a voice literally as if it came from the next room. I somehow always manage to fool myself into thinking they're real. I've never heard anything when I know I'm alone. 

Is this common? Obviously the content of what I hear has caused me some problems, and I guess I'm still in doubt as to whether all of it has been in my head. I'm on a bit of risperidone now, but I haven't been out in public much since I've been on it. Because of that I don't really have anything to compare.

I'm interested in peoples opinions on a certain subject. I'll cut it short.

I have been taking depots as a voluntarily patient for just over two years after a drug induced psychotic episode. They changed my medication to aripiprazole tablets at the beginning of December. I have been non compliant with the tablets to see if I could live without medication. I have done this without telling my male nurse and every two weeks he is asking me whether I have been taking them. I feel really bad about lying to him but I feel that in his position he is protecting himself first against the feeling of failure if I relapse and the potential hospital bill. So far its been 9 weeks without ill effects. I understand that I could be waiting for up to 2 years to see how it goes. I don't feel that I can speak to him about this as he has already recommended that I have the new aripiprazole depot that has just been approved.

I believe many of my symptoms speak to prodromal schizophrenia.  My psychiatrist believes it is MDD with severe psychosis coupled with GAD (GAD being a component most likely regardless).  My therapist thinks I have schizotypal personality disorder coupled with MDD and GAD.  My doctor before this believed I just had anxiety.

But the way things have progressed and through the way my mind works, I believe signs point toward schizphrenia.  The biggest reason I've asked professionals why it's not a concern is that I'm aware of my delusions and hallucinations.  But in my research, this is by no means a prerequisite for a diagnosis.

I'm not searching for a diagnosis specifically, but I want to be on the right meds going forward, especially if I change doctors.

Anyone else had this situation?  I know I'm slightly self-diagnosing, but that is a result of my research in academic journals and years of experience learning how to read them; the point being, I know how to research at that level.",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

I'm socially awkward.. I am also very frightened of going outside, although I have been slowly starting to take walks to a local coffee shop fighting my fears.

I have taken personality exams in order to help me choose a appropriate career path, most say I am a INFP..

I may have a few peculiarities but that's because I am likely suffering from a (possibly) benign brain tumour as well as stomach cancer which has spread due to the terrible stigma that mentally ill people suffer which has lead to no assistance at all. If you've never been scheduled before, you can expect all hospital staff to ignore every word out of your mouth once they read your history. I could walk into emergency with my arm torn off and they would diagnose it as a mental illness. I'm not being melodramatic.

My GP as well as a few psychiatrists from various hospitals in Sydney/Melbourne (who are the art majors of the medical world and are total and utter rejects in other fields of medicine) believe I have prodromal symptoms due to family history of paranoid schizophrenia (father, paternal grandfather, paternal uncle). No tests will ever confirm or deny their diagnosis and in a world where everyone is stupid, accepting their offer of poisonous medications is fucking ludicrous.

Like I said, I am not schizophrenic. I have not been diagnosed a schizophrenic. I don't doubt the idiots that staff these places would've made that call if not for the fact I am uncooperative and refuse to be doped up like some of the other patients. I am a rational individual and when I have had delusions, I've been able to step back through them while being objective until it made sense that these things could not possibly be true. For example, walking to the shops bothered me for some time as I would often see people leaning out of car windows waving a shot gun in my direction. Same deal if people walked by me in the street - I'd get the idea that they knew I was going to be walking by there at that time and shoot me in the back of the head once we crossed paths. I knew it wasn't true but I'd always turn my back to check on them just in case. After a while of not being shot, it gets to the point where you can assess situation and realise that these thoughts are either a little bit strange or that the people trying to kill me are some of the worst hitmen in history (they never took a shot but c'mon, surely they would've at some point if this was real). But apparently, being capable of stepping back through such thoughts while being objective is still suspect of mental illness. I disagree, these things do go on in the world and I could be targeted for various reasons (political, mistaken identity, someone with a grudge and so forth).

Apparently hearing voices is mental illness as well. When they say this, they ignore the fact that many people hear voices and are not mentally ill, it's not an uncommon phenomenon. I've been told they might become derogatory in time but that has yet to happen. My voices are not common either, I can count on 2 hands as to their occurrence in the past 12 months. It took me by surprise at first but I have paid little attention to them since as they talk gibberish and nonsensical.

Anyway, the point of this post is to warn you that if you should ever have a psychotic episode as I did back in 2011, do not contact any of the crisis teams. I did this and it was a huge mistake. Although I went into the Alfred in Melbourne as a voluntary patient, once you're in, they drug you the fuck up and in my case, tossed me into the high dependency unit. I am not a violent person nor did I make any threats to myself or others. Yet, someone there made the choice to dope me up on Zyprexa and put me in such an environment. It is so much like a jail that at first I was unsure if I actually was in the fucking hospital or local police station.

From the letter to my old DR (which I kept and didn't go back to that GP), I was suffering from persecutory delusions, ideas of reference, thought broadcasting and insertion.

That experience was my introduction to the public health system in Australia. They come to your house with the best of intentions but once you're admitted, their kind words disappear and they are nowhere to be seen. Of course, this is the best outcome one can hope for when dealing with these thugs. My experience back in Sydney has been much worse. I turned up at the ER late one night and because I refused to come in as a voluntary patient, they called the police on me. You can imagine my parents concern when the cops turned up on their doorstep at 4am in the morning looking for me. Once again, they assume mentally ill people are also stupid and the idea of returning home where I could be met by police who sign up with the sole intention of getting into drama where they can use their guns would never cross my mind. Avoiding the police, I had no option but to return to the hospital in order to get the scheduling lifted by the psych - who promptly let me back out that afternoon. I didn't even spend a night in the place yet hospital staff think it's warranted to call the police.

Anyway, after much discussion with my GP, I finally managed to out-doctor him and saw a neuro who sent me for an MRI. I have my scans but get the results next week. It doesn't look like there is anything of concern but at least it ruled out implants (this is a fucking joke, a little levity huh?!). If it's not brain cancer or a tumour of some sort, it's likely related to my spine and/or cervical disks. I have vision problems and see a lot of spots and geometric patterns over the past 6 months.

Lastly, all I can say is this. You best keep healthy because if you should ever fall sick, you are pretty much fucked. People rave on and on about gun related homicide in America but look at malpractice deaths (10 times higher). It might be hard to believe but these people cannot actually walk on water and the nursing staff quickly fall into line when the big head honcho psychiatrist posing as an able doctor comes and does his rounds as they're not in a position to question his judgement (which is based on no more than 5-10 minutes of assessment).

Save yourself the trouble and keep the shit in your head to yourself, don't share mental health concerns with doctors, share them with friends and family if you have that channel available. If you do need medication, I suggest telling them you have anxiety for valium and/or a back injury for oxycodone.

They use to say black people were not human. Then it was the gays and lesbians who were mentally deranged. Now it's anyone that has zero protection from the PC of the day which just so happens to be the supposed mentally ill because it's such a subjective field where there are zero tests to confirm or deny a diagnosis. Break your arm, show it to 10 doctors and you'll have a consensus. Have some supposed issues with your thinking and you'll get everything from PTSD to schizophrenia regardless of it's impact on your life for the better or worse.","['pobj', 'pobj', 'dobj']",-1,neu_vader

When I was in second grade I started noticing that good things happened on Tuesdays. Not because of an event that consistently happened on Tuesdays, mainly just random things that would make me enjoy the day more than usual. Then I started noticing that Thursdays were 'good days' too. Or, they usually were. I noticed that if I used a certain pencil then I almost always made a good grade, and so it became my 'good luck' pencil, just like Tuesday and Thursday were my 'good luck' days. Through out the next few years my 'good luck' and 'bad luck' triggers became more complicated. In fifth grade I became obsessed with the concept of energy. Specifically, absorbing other people's personality traits or 'luck'. By then I was afraid to borrow certain pencils from people, because the pencils had their 'essence' on them and I didn't want it getting in to me. On the other hand, if I really liked the person, there 'essence' didn't scare me. Some people I wanted to become like, I wanted to absorb their traits, and it was like I could physically feel different just by being around them. I was extremely shy in 5th grade, my anxiety was sky high every day, I always thought I was being judged. I remember when I would drop a pencil being extremely aware of what I would look like when I reached down to pick it up and wondering what the other kids were thinking about me. 
I started feeling like something was making up rules for my life. I kept seeing these patterns, where if I did a specific thing then it would make a good or bad thing happen. It started feeling like there was some unknown entity creating these patterns in my life. I didn't consider it a conscious thing, but more like there was this energy that hung around and formed into random patterns that I noticed. The patterns are not permanent, though, they never are. 

Since 6th grade I've only named my pets after foods, because I was convinced (and partly still am) that if they do not have food names then they will turn out to dislike me. I have a cat right now named ""Pumpkin"". Pumpkin wasn't my cat at first, he was adopted by my father, but i liked him instantly. Still, i didn't consider him my cat, because my father didn't buy him for ME. Then he started joking about it being my cat since it was quite fond of me. Then, he asked what it should be named, and when I said i didn't know, he brought up the name ""Pumpkin"" and I immediately agreed. It was a sign. I liked Pumpkin, he had been given a food name, so he is now my cat. 



I'm going to skip quite a few years now, so bare with me. It's going to show just how far it had went at one point in my life. 
When I was 17 I had been homeschooling for around 3 years, and I was tired of these 'patterns'. There was nothing I could do, though. If I only had a few friends before, I definitely had no friends now, and I think my isolation made things worse. I was afraid to wear panties, because wearing panties would cause bad things to happen. Wearing orange nail polish would make bad things happen. I would become afraid to go to sleep with my computer on webpages about certain people for fear that I would absorb part of their being. If I touched people that I disliked I would have to put hand sanitizer on. I came to the conclusion that I had 'good luck years' and 'bad luck years', where if I had a very good year one year then I would have a very bad year the next year to balance it out. I came to the conclusion that if I focused enough, there was a very, very mild telepathy between people and I. For instance, if I checked out someone on facebook often and they randomly messages me, it was because I had created some kind of link to them by paying them so much attention. I had been seeing 'patterns' and 'signs' before, but now it was much more intense. Sometimes when I was having a dilemma and I watched a movie or browsed the internet I was convinced it was a sign that I was to find to help me with my situation. 
Like I said, I was tired of the patterns, the signs, and thinking about the energy that randomly dictated what would happen to me. I tried to make things easier by naming the energy George, so I could take to it. I kind of therapy thing, if you will. Except, personifying this energy was a fucking AWFUL idea, and I started becoming paranoid that George wasn't just an energy, but an entity with it's own conscious thoughts that was just out to fuck with me. 
One day I accidentally hurt myself, and I noticed that the next day had been a very good day. And it all of the sudden made sense. 
Although, George cannot talk, the message was loud and clear. If I cause myself pain then he will cause good things to happen to me. 
So I started bruising and cutting myself every day. Mind you, no hallucinations of any kind, but it just made SENSE. And it worked. I usually would have good things happen to me after I hurt myself. It became to the point where both of my legs were bruised purple, blue, and yellow all over. My 'good luck' caused from that eventually ran out, though, so I quit. 
Sometime after that I got a boyfriend and actually started leaving my house more, and my obsession with patterns and signs slowly became less and less. Don't get me wrong, it was always at the back of my mind, and I acknowledged that it played a huge role in my life, but I wasn't as bothered by it as I was. Not when I was with my boyfriend, nope. 

Fastforward 3 years, and I'm 20. I'm living with a different boyfriend, unemployed, lonely, and with limited things to do. I've noticed myself becoming extremely bothered with the patterns again. I'm no longer afraid to wear panties or wear orange fingernail polish, but I'm afraid to eat baked potatoes and drink strawberry flavored water. I'm also very, very afraid of getting cheesenips. It seems like these past few years every time I get cheesenips something very bad has happened. Multiple times I've written down 'cheesenips' on my grocery list, but when I actually get in the store I'm too afraid to get them and I'll get a something similar like goldfish instead. I consider orange to be a 'good luck color', and I wear it rarely so I don't use all of that luck up. 

Anyway, I was wondering if I should go talk to someone and if there is any kind of medication that could possibly help this

That fall she began behaving very strangely... Depressed, anxious, angry... And hearing voices. She went to a psychiatrist but her symptoms quickly spiraled out of control and the depression became too much, so she admitted herself to the hospital for 3 days. While there she was given a diagnosis of psychotic depression and recovered quickly once they put her on antipsychotics (risperdal).

We didn't have the money to go back to her psychiatrist, so she went to a county run facility, which was very understaffed, but they kept her in meds. However, the new pdoc gave her a choice: depression or bipolar. She was afraid to go off the antipsychotics so she accepted the bipolar diagnosis.

Yes we know that's insanely fucked up.

Anyway, she eventually transitioned to geodon and was able to convince the new pdoc to put her back on antidepressants.

Her symptoms improved and she even got a job. The job has proven to be somewhat stressful but she did very well. With the new income she started going back to her original pdoc and therapist, who were horrified that she had to choose between bipolar and depression.

Then she had to go to TX in early 2013 for 6 weeks for training for her job, and shit hit the fan. She started off okay, then wound up failing her first test. After that she began studying constantly and worrying about getting fired... She started hallucinating visually.... Talking to people who were not there. However she wound up acing her other exams and passed the class... She also figured out that she was hallucinating. Once she got home, the hallucinations went away.

Now she rarely hears voices...but she does have racing, negative thoughts in her head when she gets stressed, and if that goes unattended they move ""outside"" her head. Recently she took on a stressful job at work and the voices started getting loud again... So her pdoc put her on Ativan, and that seems to have helped significantly. She was also moved to Wellbutrin earlier in the year, which improved her depression greatly.

The other issue we have noticed is that her memory has degraded somewhat... Her recall is terrible, but if she gets any hints the memory comes flooding back. Her short term memory isn't great either.

She also has a touch of social anxiety, but otherwise tends to be high functioning at home and work.

However her current pdoc does not seem to want to put a diagnosis on her. But I worry if we are treating the right thing or if we could be doing something better.

She has a deep insight into her illness... She has almost always been aware that her hallucinations aren't real. The psychotic symptoms are fairly intermittent and seem to go along with her depression and anxiety... When those are fine she is almost always symptom free and very high functioning. So it makes me wonder if the psychosis is a primary or secondary symptom of whatever this is.

So I wonder... Is this schizophrenia? Schizoaffective? Psychotic depression? Stress induced psychosis? Or does it even matter? Should I push her doctor for a diagnosis?

Is there anything I can do to help her or improve her treatment?

Any advice or thoughts are welcome.",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

My wife's sister has schizophrenia and lives in our neighborhood with her parents.  She's currently in the middle of her second break that started eight months ago after she decided to discontinue her medicine without discussing it with anyone.  Before this she had five good years on Risperdal, but now she's been bouncing between providers and hasn't been on the same medicine for long enough to see good results.  
She just recently agreed to sign papers giving my wife power of attorney, but hasn't actually done it yet.  (We live in the United States for legal and healthcare-related issues.)  She also only recently agreed to apply for disability, and so she does not currently have any insurance.  She just got back on Risperdal injections a couple weeks ago, but it hasn't shown significant results yet.

Immediate problem:
She has been refusing to sleep for several days now because her current delusion is that a lot of people (loved ones, strangers, anyone) are in grave danger and going to be hurt and only her constant focus on them with her mind can keep them safe.  She refuses any medications to help her sleep because she doesn't want to.  My wife works in the mental health field and already today checked with all of the hospitals in the area and none have beds available and the ERs each have at least 4 people waiting for beds.  So we just aren't sure if it will do any good to try to get help that way at this point because we think that the people already waiting may be in a more emergent situation.
We have tried reasoning with her and demonstrating that all of her family is safe and that she is safe, but it hasn't helped.  We are planning on just trying to create the most relaxing environment possible and hope that she loses her vigilance, but we don't have a lot of hope in that, either.
Does anyone have any advice?

I'm an author currently in the research phase for my next book, but I've come up against some potential problems. The basic gist of the story is that the main character is an empath, a psychic, who sees/talks to/interacts with ghosts and spirits. He hates his gift and spent his childhood trying to ignore it, but he's grown stronger as he aged to the point where the voices and the begging are unbearable. I wanted to have him seek therapy and (knowingly) pass for schizophrenic so that he can have access to anti psychotic medications that he hopes will dull his powers. It doesn't really work, so he goes down a long road of drug abuse and denial before finally coming to terms with who he is.

The very last thing I want is to minimalize what living with schizophrenia is like, or to add to the stigma by somehow enforcing ideas that I don't intend. I thought the best people to ask about this would be you guys. How would a story like this make you feel? Is it fine as long as he acknowledges that he's faking a real illness, or could it maybe even be an allegory for the struggles with drugs and self-acceptance that some people with schizophrenia suffer?

My approach to this is to simply try to create as many happy moments/situations for her as I can, since over the years I learned that there is nothing I can do. I blame myself every time I snap, every time I don't have enough patience, every time I am unfair, every time I don't help enough,...

There is NO ONE, simply NO ONE, in my family who is willing to help her. I'm the only person she has and all I want is for her to feel as happy as she can. No meds, no therapist (I've given up hope on that matter).

Due to my medication most of my positive symptoms have become less distracting or faded away entirely. However I still experience the negative symptoms of the illness, lack of motivation, secludedness, and complete lack of desire to socialise. It's a constant struggle for me to get up and do something, and I myself feel like I am doing a decent job at counteracting the things mentioned (I am actively searching for a job, go to job interviews and generally try to help out in the house a bit). However my parents don't see the amount of effort it takes me to do even these minimal tasks, and are saying I'm being lazy and constantly telling me to ""pull myself together"" and start being more active. I know schizophrenia is no excuse to be lazy and lay around all day doing nothing (which I am NOT doing, I am trying to counteract...), but my parents will simply not acknowledge that due to my illness all those things I do and am supposed to do require a lot more effort from me than they would for a healthy person. I tried explaining it to my parents like my doctor did to me, and they simply dismissed it as nonsense. I bought a book about better understanding schizophrenia, my mother read it but it seems to me either she didn't understand or simply refuses to form a connection to my illness. My father flat out refused to read the book and generally claims that I'm not sick at all and just acting like an asshole and lazy bum because I want to (even though I was in a psychiatric ward for a month and he was told by my psychiatrist exactly what my condition is). This couldn't be further from the truth though, I would LOVE being able to enjoy life the way others do, without having to analyze my reality at every turn and constantly check myself for weird or antisocial behaviour and counteract it.  
I don't know what I'm expecting from this post, but maybe some of you were in a similar position and could help me out with tips on how to handle this matter, as the atmosphere at home becomes more and more toxic and I alone am blamed for it.",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

I'm not asking for advice so much as seeing if this is a normal thing / asking about your experiences. I'll be seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow but in the meantime I'm just curious. I won't be treating any responses as medical advice or suggestions. That said...

Last Wednesday I had my rx of risperidone increased by one mg. Is that soon enough to tell if it'll have any effect, or is the standard 3-5 weeks what I'll have to wait to tell? 

The reason I ask is because my doctors are big proponents of medicating without overdoing it. While I'm also afraid of feeling over-medicated, I'm concerned that what I'm on may not be enough. Do I wait longer or do I ask for another change in dose? If you're stable on meds, is it possible to still have episodes or experience hallucinations and/or delusions?

i currently have an obsessional fear of developing schizophrenia

some background. I am 21 years old, no family history of the disease at all, never smoked weed or done any drugs

i have really bad hypochondria/pure ocd that got REALLY bad a few months ago after a particularly stressful event. for the past few months i have been obsessing about having a particular disease or going crazy.

initially i was nervous i had a brain tumor. i thought i was going to die. ct scan turned up nothing, so i stopped worrying about it.

also i had fears about other disease, but they all turned out to be nothing.

then my nervousness turned to schizophrenia. i am nervous my thoughts are what a paranoid schizo would think, but i was never was worried about being paranoid until the ct scan came back negative about me having a brain tumor. until then all my mind was focusing on was me possibly having a tumor! Basically I feel like my OCD is single-track minded.

i don't hear voices or see anything no one else sees at all. would that automatically rule out this condition?

also i feel like it is VERY hard for me to dismiss these concerns, even if i sort of know in the back of my mind that they are ridiculous but i have these constant ""doubts""... sort of saying to myself...what if i was secretly deep down schizophrenic, similar to a doubt someone would have about going crazy and harming someone. i am on meds - Xanax - to help calm me down ,but it doesn't seem to help too much.

thanks

There were several reasons, including moving out of my psychiatrist's area, feeling like I wasn't sick and didn't need meds, etc.About a month ago, my symptoms started creeping back. The voices came back, the thoughts about police surveillance and the belief that I control the weather with my mind. I sort of know these things aren't that real but when I'm in it I can't tell. So about 2 weeks ago I saw my family Dr and she saw how bad I looked and started trying to get me set up with a clozapine restart before it was too late. The referrals went out but were taking forever. In the meantime, I was deteriorating day by day. When she called me a few days later I was mumbling incoherently at times and she told me to go straight to hospital. I had other plans so I waited a few days then went to hospital. The first ER I went to had a good reputation and had recently had a renovation so it looked really nice. They triaged me right in and I saw a psychiatrist within an hour. He looked at my history and looked at me and decided I was sick but not sick enough for hospital. So he let me go. The next day I went out to a support group, barely making it out of the house and had not gotten it together enough to eat that day. The doctor that runs the group took one look at me and said ""hospital, now"" essentially. So she called ahead (advocacy #1) and I went to a different hospital than the previous night. This time I waited three hours to see the psychiatrist and was swiftly admitted. The next morning, however, the new psychiatrist decided that since I could hold a basic conversation, I was well enough for discharge so he let me go. 14 hours total time in hospital. The next day I was at home, barricaded in my room with a baseball bat because the voices were telling me that the police were coming to kill me. My family doctor called and said she had heard all about what happened and had also spoken to the support group doc. So, she called hospital #3 and gave them my story then she called me a cab so that I didn't have to go by ambulance (ambulance means police as well in my area and that would have made me run or lash out). Hospital #3 had me seen by a psych nurse and a doctor within an hour and admitted and on ward within 5 hours. I finally got to restart clozapine and am now starting to feel better with a new lesson learnt about continuing to take meds. Without the advocacy I probably would have deteriorated into dangerous territory. Does anyone else have experience of falling through the cracks like this?",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

If he is so focussed on your life- to critique a moment and the next with no delay- how sad a being he must be, whether a part of you or not. Imagine his dialogue coming from a man in a cramped, cobwebbed studio, staring into your life and broadcasting his personal judgement into a disconnected microphone. When he asks for another opinion on you, he is looking over and debating his own dusty reflection. There is no power in that unless you take his words as holding more meaning than your own. In the end, he is just a voice using metaphysical sonar to vicariously explore you and your world through you, bouncing off your perception, trying to attack you with what he has learnt. But in the very act of rebounding, he is behind you. In the very state of vicariousness, he is not your life.

(Is he is another- if he is separate from you and located elsewhere, then still he is pitiable- for what else can he know but scraps of you, after focussing on only you for so long?) 

What can he do but endeavour to influence this great boundless titan- of life- that he sees? What pleasure it must give him to cause you to think or feel or do things based on his disjointed ramblings! He is but a lifeless voice causing you to think- causing you to defend yourself to a malevolent echo of yourself or create mazes in your mind to avoid crossing a path of thought that might feed him or because, in crossing that path, he would be right about you that you wanted to cross it all along; causing fear and panic, sorrow and regret, pride and ignorance- emotions- all because *you end up bouncing off his echoed perception of you!*; causing you to do things you would not do if not for his influence, just to avoid his opinion. 

And he succeeds. You create the mazes and avoid those thoughts because you fear that, unlike so many other thoughts or images so easily examined and set free, those will end up defining you. Yet by not being able to set them free, they already do. He is defining you- this ghost with no power but for that of a scrambled echo of your perception is defining you, leashing you, restricting you from being able to define yourself. He cannot achieve this without your willingness- it is like a scar causing you to face another way, except only you and the scar can see the scar. Others may see you face away, or see you act a certain way that is confusing to them, but they do not see the scar. They may see some anomalous behaviour and blame it on some intellectual or perceptual or character flaws. But they cannot see the scar- much less feel it. 

He makes you speak things aloud that before you would have swiftly thought and released and moved on. Why? If you are under surveillance, then is it not wise to restrict your verbal confirmations? Let them guess, let them assume. Do not defend yourself- you have no need to. It will lead to you saying things you do not mean, which will cause you more anxiety. If they are there, watching you, let them guess at your motives. Let them guess. It will speed your thought processes up by a large factor- not having to take time to deny plausible (or spoken) allegations, not having to devise plans of action that will prove these allegations wrong, not trying to *entertain* them or build yourself to be a certain kind of person. Do not put effort into deceiving them or attempting to hide untruths; put effort into ignoring them- they are a sad, pathetic thing with no life other than what you lend them and no stimuli other than what you feed them, whether they are only internal or not. They and their opinions are inconsequential unless you act on them- then you are a direct consequence of their opinion, and they are defining you, whether you think you’re succeeding at deceiving them or not.

Back then I struggled a lot with thinking people were talking about me. Looking back on it now I realize most of it was paranoia, which can occur with social anxiety, but I believe it was more paranoia than social anxiety.

Flash forward to the present and now I'm struggling with the same thing only I'm not sure if its all in my head or not. Like I know for a fact that people do talk about others, its just a reality of the world we live in but I'm no longer sure how much of it my brain is making up.

Sometimes I hear bits of conversations and think I'm being talked about but after listening intently realize it has nothing to do with me. What really messes with me is when I hear a snippet of a conversation and can't really make out the rest. When that happens my brain sort of makes up things they're saying even though I can't really hear anything.

Combine that with my social anxiety and feeling uncomfortable in public while thinking people are looking at me and the world becomes a very uncomfortable place for me. 

So essentially I can't really be sure if someone is talking about me or not. Which makes it hard for me to emotionally process. I mean if its all in my head then its not real I can ignore it. But if it is really happening I feel like I should do something or at least be aware of what's being said. I'm not sure how to feel at all since I can't tell. I'm on medication but this symptom seems to have not gone away.

The ANRP (going to just say nurse from now on) thought that I had bipolar along with anxiety and depression. Well, that nurse ended up not being able to see me any more so today was the first day I seen someone new. I actually seen the MD this time along with his nurse. Before he left I asked him straight up what he thinks and he said I have anxiety and depression with psychotic tendencies.

I wasn't really shocked as I've recently became more and more aware that my worries are definitely out there but it's still really new to me.

I'm also still really confused how one doctor can say Bipolar, which is what I was originally being treated for. I was put on Risperdal because I had an allergic reaction to the other common medicine (the name slips my mind) and I have other factors that made it impossible to take the other non-psychotic related ones. Then today nothing is said about my Bipolar and I am told I just have psychotic tendencies.

I'm really confused and am afraid of that diagnosis. I'm afraid to tell my family if they ask as there's such a stigma surrounding it. I also feel confused because do I have Bipolar or psychosis or both? The doctor barely spent any time with me but it does make sense.

I've never heard voices or what have you but I do always think people are judging me and listening to what I am doing all the time. I also see stuff out of the corner of my eye ALL-THE-TIME. Like, to the point I get mad when it happens because it causes me to get extremely anxious for no reason. I just feel like I can't trust anyone. Like everyone is out to do harm to me. If I say something a little out of line they might be recording it and use it against me. Stuff like that. How can you start to recognize it's ""weird"" but at the same time feel it's 100% factual? That makes absolutely no sense to me.

I don't know. Maybe I'm just trying to grasp at straws here so I can feel like maybe he's wrong because I don't want it to be true.

While they have a mood disorder clinic, I found it peculiar that they focus on inflammation as a contribution to whatnot psychiatric illness.

&gt; Exceptional psychiatric care means staying at the forefront of new therapeutic options. Tufts Medical Center’s Psychopharmacology Program offers a unique approach to mental health not found at most other hospitals. Led by Gregory Oxenkrug, MD, PhD, the program has a special focus on the role inflammation can play in psychiatric disorders.

&gt; Our research, often performed by Dr. Oxenkrug, suggests that inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, hepatitis C, inflammatory bowel disease and acne — as well as the aging process itself — can influence mental health. Working with your primary-care physician and our colleagues in specialties like dermatology and gastroenterology, we determine if your psychiatric condition has an inflammatory component. Based on the results, we may recommend adding an anti-inflammatory medication to increase the effectiveness of your psycho-pharmacological treatment plan.

As someone with a past semi-severe case of acne, year-long chemotherapy for Ewing's Sarcoma, as well as a decade-long sleeping problem.. which Dr. Oxenkrug specializes in circadian rhythm disorders... separately, I may have a mood disorder with a psychotic component rather than full-fledged schizophrenia that can be related to so this sounds interesting to me. I may have to report back myself, especially since it seems like this is a specialized/niche research at its forefront. **But does anyone have idea of inflammation and its role to schizophrenia psychiatric illness - mental health in general?**",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

I'm a 21 year old student with a long history of depression. I see a psychiatrist regularly for ADD and depression mostly, but I haven't told my pdoc much of the following for fear that my Vyvanse (amphetamine) prescription will be taken away. Stupid I know, but I really need it to function on a daily basis and to do well (or even get by) in college, which I care(d) about greatly.


Over the past month or two, my general cognitive ability has declined. Normally I could learn a lot of very technical information in a short space of time, but now I struggle to remember basic things. My short term memory has turned to shit and my long term memory isn't great. I find myself getting confused over basic, everyday things, not to mention misplacing everything and not remembering things that just happened/that I just did.


My ability to communicate has declined pretty sharply too. I've never been all that great at verbal communication but recently I've been struggling to communicate some basic things to even my family members. I just can't organize my thoughts and form words properly. 


I feel much less social. Even though I was never that social, I'm shying away from any and all social activity now, pretty much. Even with talking to people in my family who I actually like talking to, I just can't. I feel dead inside most of the time. Not good or bad, just nothing.


My motivation is *completely* gone. I'm in a competitive STEM major at a pretty good university, and I haven't met anybody in my major who gets better grades than me, so obviously I'm usually very hardworking and motivated (I really do love what I study). Now with this lack of motivation I can't get anything done, even my precious amphetamine does little to nothing. This is very pronounced and pretty upsetting for me. Between this and the memory/cognitive difficulties I can barely read a body of text.


My perception of time is way off lately. Normally I'm very aware of time, always being able to guess what time it is before checking, or knowing exactly when the alarm I set (eg if I had something in the ovan) is about to go off. This is so very unlike me that it has me weirded out. Remembering what happened in the day that has just passed can be difficult too, sometimes I think its been two days since the stuff that happened that morning happened. 


The above is what the psychiatrist knows, the following is what I've kept to myself.


Since I started on ADHD medication at the start of college, I've seen people's faces morph into other faces while they're walking towards me from a distance. I would always ""recognize"" the person walking towards me, but then they would change and I would realize they were just a random person I didn't know. This happens multiple times per day and seems to be getting worse, every person not directly in-front of me I think is somebody I know.


When I'm in a group situation like a lecture or the library, I'm really paranoid that I'm saying my thoughts out loud which people could therefor hear. After I think I said something out loud I'd start looking around a little bit and interpreting simple things that people do as signs that I did just say it out loud.  


When I'm alone or by myself in public and hear people taking in the distance or in another room, I always perceive they're talking about me: hearing them reference something that I just did, etc, sometimes even hear my name or them pointing, even though I definitely don't know them (and I'm not in any way a notable person). 


Out of the corner of my vision I've been seeing some weird things. Like people standing/walking in front of a frosted glass door when it was me and one other person in the house. There was a bit of the duvet of my bed sticking up while I was sitting on the floor at the bottom of my bed looking for something, I saw this as a decomposing body-like head/neck.. 


Coming up to exams last semester I was taking a Vyvanse dose in the afternoon in addition to the one in the morning, so 100mg Vyvanse per day roughly (21mg d-amphetamine). After a few days my visual snow (which I always have) got much worse, with TV-static-like particles floating around everywhere, even in the light. I was able to interact with them by moving them with my fingers/hands, moving them. Some lighter colored particles stayed around my finger tips in the shape of flames, and behaved like flames would when I moved my hands around. Also when I looked at any fixed point, I could see everything in my visual field moving around/flowing.


Very recently I smoked about 4 joints in the space of like 3 hours with a few of my friends who I don't see very often, I was having proper visual and auditory hallucinations at that time, but my friends were barely stoned. All the ""corner of the eye"" stuff was magnified by a lot, seeing people setting on the couch with only a sheet of paper actually being there. I heard somebody walk in the front door and run upstairs even though the front door was locked, a clear and loud voice come from outside the room we were sitting in, things like that. It was so very creepy and I've never had a response to weed anything close to that before. 


The majority of the stuff my doctor knows about is predated by the stuff that I kept to myself by the way, so the cognitive stuff (that I've noticed) is newer. I'm thinking about coming clean on a few points though next visit (which is in a couple of weeks).


So if any of you have made it though this wall of text, do you have any opinions and/or advice for me? Does this sound like schizophrenia?

Everything keeps getting connected. I was just researching ""Alogia"" yesterday and today I saw a post about it here. It makes me more certain that he universe is 'rigged and that everything I see is props and sometimes they're reused.

I know that doesn't sound true, but there are SO many coincidences. 

The girl from my doctors office got on the public bus with me and got off at the same stop today.

It's so hard to focus and I have no idea what anyone is talking about unless they say something that triggers my memory. Because I keep drawing blanks so often. Sucks, especially at work when I have to remember a lot.

I always used to think aripripazole was the worst for stiffening my muscles so much I wasn't able to walk normally, but amisulpride is much more horrifying, in that I had muscle contractions in my neck for hours that made my entire face and upper body distort and I couldn't do anything but cry in agony. 

I have tried olanzapine which made me twitch, and quetiapine which just made me sleep a lot. Some I'm unwilling to take for their extreme appetite stimulation and I struggle with weight gain as it is. In just 6 hours I will have another appointment with my psychiatrist and I will have to tell her that amisulpride wasn't the saviour I was hoping for, and please I need something else again... But I don't really want to keep trying new stuff and be in agonising pain again or just have my body stiffened again. Is there nothing else that could be tried?

A bit of background: I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder one and a half years ago, and I've been taking Olanzapina for almost a year now. My hallucinations became slightly less, and it helps a bit with my mood disorder. 

Lately, my sense of taste has changed. For example: today I opened a beer, the brand I always drink, but now it tastes like white wine (and I don't like wine, so I never drink it). 

Also sometimes chocolate tastes like orange, or other weird changes happen.

My questions are: do/did you also experience something like this as well? Could it be a side effect of my meds, or is it a symptom? 

Thanks!",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

I can hear them through music, through books and tv. Nothing stops it.

I don't have sz but I do have some bizzare psychotic disorder that they really haven't been able to pinpoint what it is, so they just call it drug induced, and I figured this would be the best place to ask.

I've been on Latuda for the year and a half that I've had this disorder and it has worked perfectly up until a few weeks ago. I currently take 140mg a day with at least 350 calories of food. But my voices have been coming back. Some days I hear voices and other days I don't. I just had the dose upped from 120mg and I'm seeing my psychiatrist again tonight. Max dose is 160mg so if that doesn't work I may have to either switch meds or add another one.

The voices are really distracting and bring about certain delusions, and I can't really sleep at night when I'm hearing them, so I'm hoping to figure this out soon. 

So what I'm wondering is, is there any way an antipsychotic can just stop working, or start to only work sometimes? I was under the impression that they didn't ""poop out"" like ADs.

Other things, too. Memories of hallucinations in college, despite that my symptoms were not to do with hallucinations (disorganized type means delusions are secondary to other symptoms), and other inexplicable events, an offer of sex from my high school teacher.

I've been taking Risperidone 3.5 mg for a couple weeks now and most of the drowsiness has worn off to the point where I can stay awake for a good part of the day.

My problem is in three parts:

First, the ""mind fog"" hasn't worn off... I feel like my memory and higher-level thinking is half of what it once was.

Second, my motivation and ability to derive pleasure from things is basically zero (I don't have any desire to partake in my once-hobbies).

Third, I have pain in my left breast, and after looking up the relationship between this and Risperidone, I am very concerned about growing breasts (I am a male).

I was wondering if anyone else has experienced these problems with similar medications (atypical antipsychotics) and how they have coped with the problems. I am honestly terrified that the rest of my life will be like it is now, not to mention that I will have large man-breasts.

Her diagnoses went from PTSD to BI-Polar Disorder and PTSD to finally schizophrenia and PTSD. She rarely experiences complete psychosis to the point where she is seemingly another person meaning she has a blank expression on her face and does not say anything however she will do thing that would be considered socially abnormal. In college she climbed a tree for 4 hours and was convinced that everyone was trying to kill her. things got better as she started to take her meds consistently. 
     
During  this time or shortly after she started experimenting with lucid dreaming and trying to achieve astral projection. Instead she has created an alternate reality when she sleeps and she is ""transported"" back to the time she was 14 and basically reliving her life all the people aside from me that were in her life at the time (i wasnt) are in this ""reality"" and they try to convince her that her dream world is reality. she says that when she goes to this place she can feel like she has been there for weeks living her life as a normal 14 year old. Then that world took a turn for the worse and their was a nuclear holocaust and she has become some sort of freedom fighter for a rebel army and all of her family is gone (not irl). she says in this state she experiences all five senses and pain and it feels real. 

Her family in real life is little to no help and just ignores the fact that she has this disorder and they are extremely manipulative and passive aggressive. she told them she heard voices when she was 12 and they didn't or refused to believe her. Her brothers only advice was to ""think her way out of it"" when she told him what she experienced. Gee thanks, the next time i contract a disease like cancer ill just think my way out of it.

Anyways My questions are as follows. i love her unconditionally and and she refuses to see a therapist. i am her only anchor in reality and i want to know some ways i can help her and better understand what she is going through. How can i help her become grounded in this reality? what can i do when she is in a sever state of psychosis? she also says that sometimes she thinks schizophrenia is a ""super power"" of sorts allowing her to exist in multiple dimensions at once Ie dream world. What can i do to help?

I've had horrible night terrors since I was younger. People eating me, me killing other people. My teeth falling out was one from recently. Last night I had one that I fell into a bed of cactus..then became a cactus. Weird things. I've had so many dreams. At least three a night,sometimes.
 I've been told I talk in my sleep... All the time. I sleep walk as well.  I can't sleep. I wake up at weird times of the night with volts of energy. I'm so awake, but my eyes hurt so badly. 

Here's a little bit about me:
I'm an artist . I've been drawing since I was younger. I'm now 20 years old. 
Over the past couple of years, I've began to see colors floating around. Patterns in everything. My head is racing constantly. I can rant on and on, and given the opportunity to discuss with another intellectual, our conversation can last for hours. 
I feel.. So many people are ignorant and intolerable. Human interaction has been difficult. I'm quite sociable, you see, but if it's one on one companionship, I tend to become intolerable. My brain thinks too much.
Too much about colors, things I see past this reality.
 
My last doctor diagnosed me with anxiety, social anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies. I've even stayed at a facility for a couple of weeks. All of the staff told me I didn't belong there because I was so happy and cheerful. 
But I had dreams while there. So many dreams. Sometimes I just sat and drew. Filled up a few sketchbooks while there, too. People paid me quite a bit for my drawings, because most of them I just threw away. 
 
Maybe I just have an overactive imagination? I don't know anymore. 

My insurance is going out at the end of this year, so I dont know how much time I have left. 
I've been to a couple psychiatric doctors, who have not helped. I feel like they waste my time, only to subscribe me medications that only allow temporary to no relief. My last doctor put me on ambien, which was horrible. I've used other medications since, to help my sleeping habits, and none of them help. 
I have such a difficult time sleeping. During the day, all I see are small fractals of my dreams, colors, words. I've gotten so much skinnier, because food doesn't feel appetizing. It's just colors, weird smells that make my mind imagine weird things. Like creatures that forms out of the aroma. I try to eat things with no smell. 

I feel like my imagination is taking over my life. Like I'm becoming unbearable to others.

I don't know what this is, if it's an overactive imagination, a case of paranoia, or some form of schizophrenia from my anxiety.

I have videos with this guy that our folks took of us riding trikes and one where he kissed me and stole my trike. We were little kids. 

So I ran into him. We talked and figured out we used to live in the same building and play together as kids. It's been... 18 years. We're both 22 now. 

Found out he's schizophrenic. Told him I am, too. He told me he's been sick since he was 16, and I've been sick since the end of last year. 

We hung out a couple nights ago. He said he was going to this bar, and invited me. So I agreed to go, I went there and he wasn't there, so I called, and he wanted me to meet him outside. This is where he proceeded to talk about getting weed and asked if I had anything red to wear because it was his favorite color. That was odd, but whatever, I just wanted to go get something non-alcoholic to drink and catch up with this guy. We never went into that bar together. 

We walked around the parking lot back and forth for a while. He couldn't stay in one place. We went to the liquor store and he bought a six pack of beer, he drank a bit of one and left it on the ground by the store. 

He was all over the place. He told me that I'm a sloth and he's a lion. He got religious on me and asked if I was a ""friend or foe"" in regards to my believing in God like he did. He opened the cans of beer one at a time on the long walk back to his house(I stupidly agreed to go, even though I don't know him well, I just said yes)and dumped the beer on the floor then throw the can there saying it was all bad beer when the one he drank he said was good. On the walk to his place he said people were following us. We were going there to listen to music and hangout there. It was a long walk. I wish we'd stayed at the bar, and actually went in. 

Anyways. He did some odd things. And I get it. We're both sick. I don't know if he's on meds, though, I know he sees a psychiatrist but not sure if he's taking his meds. 

My point is, I want to communicate better with him, but I feel uncomfortable talking to him. I know he has a history of violence against his family and his mother seemed afraid of him when I was with the both of them. I just.. I want to be his friend but I almost feel afraid. I don't want to encourage delusional thinking or anything but what do I say when he says he wants to ""kill someone spiritually"" or that people are following us? That people are tricking us? 

It was a tough night. I didn't feel closer to him or like I knew him more, I just knew his schizophrenia more. He was a bit controlling. Telling me not to look down when walking and to walk faster. It was concerning.

He seems so far away. And I remember being far away earlier this year. Being just like him. I was talking to myself and people were watching me on the bus and recording my life and I was really sick. 

I want to be able to help him, but is that even my place? I want to be a good friend, but I guess I need to know more about him first. 

Do you guys know other schizophrenics? How do you talk to them when they're experiencing delusions or hallucinations, since you know what they're going through? How can I help him?

Job before that pub manager and before that an accountant for a big company, after getting sacked from the pub job (drugs) decided to give up completely and listen to the voices and jumped in front of a bus, obviously survived that but ended up in rehab on 24th birthday.  

Now 35, still drug free but that includes any medication!  Signed off sick indefinitely but passed a fit to work test 5 years ago and had all benefits stopped.  Ended up on the work programme and because I still seem ok to other people I ended up volunteering with a work programme provider spending two days a week in an office phoning long term unemployed and sick people to find out why they could not work or what they were doing to find work.  Each successful assessment earned the company £300-600 depending on the benefits the person was getting.  Had a very bad week there when I looked up my own name on the system and could see what the job centre had written about me, nothing about schizophrenia, suicide, self harm just drugs and alcohol mentioned as a barrier to work, I thought I would be able to get some help from the people that I was working for, to get my problems added to my file,  really big mistake.  Volunteered for a year exactly there, asked job centre for help and after 4 years they decided that I was disabled, cheers for that, needed a new label.  

I had only been applying for office work for all this time, can get interviews but can't actually do them.  Attended an open day for a sandwich chain that wants happy touchy people working for them and got the job.  35 hrs a week, making sandwiches.  Did not work out the way I thought and have been serving customers for over a year, technically the conditions that I work under should have blown my brain but actually ended up being good at the job, even though I am still at the beginner stage at the company I get paid more than all the rest because I am good but different.  My dad had cancer and died during this time, I had a really good manager but he got moved on.  

The replacement manager I didn't like so got the same job pay and conditions at another shop but no one was allowed to transfer.  I then got a transfer but not the one I wanted and in the last 3 days I have never been so sick in public, I was talked into signing something that said that I had received training that I had not had.  Not had any training in old shop because I signed something and even when I say I have never done it no one has ever tried to listen.  

I was saying no for the first time in years but she wouldn't listen and then everything got louder.  My MOD for the day ignored me when I said ""help, don't know what's going"" since then I've been a bit out of control and nobody has done or said anything to stop me.  I don't know how I am going to keep my job now, the actual manager was going to talk to me about it after lunch today but that didn't happen.  

Do I try to get help from the company or just leave?  I can do the job better than most as long as I know that people will follow all of the rules of the company and working with someone to say no for me.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

I need to help educate my brother as he's only done a little research and says things like "" I never feel like the medication is really working"" and ""I don't believe they really know what they are talking about, they don't understand what it even is"" he is very sceptical of the medical community and doesn't trust their advice. 

My brother (25) almost certainly has a drug problem. Despite understanding talks from his family about the dangers and consequences has been using and relapsing anyway even after telling us he feels drugs aren't good for him. He has been hospitalized once and since getting somewhat better through medication and therapy has had some relapses brought on by the persistent drug use (has admitted to taking ecstasy and pot a number of times and raving/clubbing a lot). He also lives at home with my bipolar mother who is currently in the midst of a deep long lasting depression (hers lasts months, not eating much, washing, very paranoid and history of self harm) the pressure of looking after her and being her carer is obviously a big contributor to the drug taking and relapses.

I'm worried that one or both of them will end up dead. My brother once ran out in the road during an episode and nearly got run over by a car and then proceeded to jump on top of the car, totalling it - this was about a year ago.  My mother has taken overdoses during past depressive episodes.

I don't really know what on earth to do to help them. We live in the UK and the NHS doesn't have much resources, I took him to the Emergency room yesterday after being worried about his erratic and aggressive behaviour towards my mother but they just gave him a lecture about drug taking and sent him home with 2 tranquilliser type pills to calm him down.

What I've been told is that it was a delusion to think that the voices were people in another dimension talking to me to get my help, and that the only way to help them was to kill myself so I could go there and save them. Only I could hear them so I was their only chance.

Anyways, got hospitalized, got out, was off meds for a month or so, a little more, and have been on meds since. I'm on Latuda and Prozac. Liking both, not noticing any side effects besides feeling nauseous after taking them and being tired during the day.

But this past week or so, I've been thinking more and more about that other dimension, about what it means, what it holds. And I just KNOW there is something bigger than me going on.

My doctor is concerned about a particular issue I have (perhaps more concerned than I am) and seems to be wanting to press for medication as that seems to be the only thing available to treat that symptom. 

However, the risks of anti-psychotics for something which affects me sporadically (a couple times a week at most most of the time) seems excessive, especially since the terror and paranoia I had before has become quite mild that in comparison I do not notice it, and the issues which do cause me concern are more of a concern for me personally, rather than something which affects my interactions with anybody else.

Considering I have gone 26 years without any drugs and that the worst hallucinations and delusions (which, at the time, I was unaware were not real) are in my past, and that if I am not stressed, the symptoms are only a personal irritation, I do not think introducing drugs now of this nature would do me good in the long run.

If they do not help, then I risk the side effects, expense, and personal aversion to drugs. 

If they do happen to help, then I'll like want to keep taking them and be unable to stop (I fear going back to the way it was, so I expect that if I changed, I'd fear going back to the way I am). If taking them caused weight gain or other problems, I'd be torn.

She has not been diagnosed with anti social disorder or narcissisms, but everyone knows she is manipulative and without empathy. The 16M has a bucketload of mental problems that recently surfaced at the beginning of this year, and has been in a mental hospital facility for about ~2 months now.  People in our family have a long history of mental disorders. However everyone thought my cousin, let's call her R, would be fine. She seemed confident and oh so very sane. She was always stubborn as a mule, but she had to be with her mother. 

She got a boyfriend recently that she met online(when she was 18?). A 23/24 year old living with his mother and not going to school. She went to visit him in Canada and told me that not only did she lose that virginity she had always talked about saving for marriage, but she had also taken it in the back door, tried MJ for the first time, and drank for the first time (though I asked and she was not inebrated the first time she did it). This was unlike her, and honestly even though the idea of the guy annoyed me, I was happy that she loosened up and I thought this meant she might be able to get out there and meet sane people and make friends. Her father was always a very religious man, in a sick way. She adopted his ideals and it had always worried me. 

My cousin talked about moving to Canada when her two years at community college were up. Another family member and I had been trying to convince her to go to a university straight out of high school, as we wanted to get her away from her mom and in a place where she could concentrate on herself. I didn't like the idea of her going to another country for a boy she met online, but I thought ""at least this will get her that much closer to a Uni."" It might be worth noting that when I talked about visiting her at a Uni she told me she didn't want me to, that she didn't want any family to visit her. It hurt, a lot. It felt like she was lumping me in with the rest of the family. However I knew her mother never put my cousin's wants before her own, so I felt like maybe this was something necessary to show her she could trust me to put her own needs before my desires. Also, I went no contact with her mother after she crossed the line and I realized she was abusing me, and her mother is the kind of person that constantly lies and talks bad about anyone who holds her accountable for her own actions. Like, all the time. The woman will not shut up and will get super mad at you if you don't constantly pay attention to her. 

Then she started posting weird messages on Facebook. When I talked to her, she seemed more stubborn than usual, and I felt like I had to watch my words with her, which I had never done before. I didn't think it was anything besides her just growing up and discovering herself. 

I don't want to post the messages she did on Facebook directly, but here is the gist of some of them: ""I am an old soul. Can I grow up now? I never wanted to be a child. Being a child made my head hurt."" She talked about how life was a popularity game and how she gets along with the older generation, how it's unfair that she has to do things she doesn't want to like work for a living. 

And then came the day when a family member (our aunt. Not her mother. I have two aunts) told me that my cousin was in the hospital. Apparently she freaked out and became paranoid. She called the cops and told them that they better stop spying on her or she will get very mad. Apparently she then went and yelled at the neighbors. She also apparently tried to ""steal"" her grandma's (who she lived with) car and drive up to Canada. The cops came, and she was dropped off in a mental health facility four days ago. She is still there. My family tells me she is ""heavily doped up.""

No one saw this coming. My cousin is the responsible, sane, confident one. I thought, even when I heard this, that she would be fine. Then I talked to my grandma, who spread misinformation given to her by my cousins mother that R had been threatening the cops. I'm beyond pissed that my grandma is just listening to what her sociopathic daughter is telling her and believing it willy nilly AND spreading the information to others like it is fact. I had already been told by our sane aunt that R's grandma had dropped off her stuff at her mom's house, kicking her out. Anyone who would have been looking at both of our faces when she told me this news would know how horrible this is. I can imagine very little worse for my cousin than to go back and live with her manipulative, selfish, sociopathic, bipolar who skips her meds and sometimes attacks people, horrible mother. My grandma (not the one who kicked my cousin out) informed me that my cousin was planning to move in with her boyfriend. As shady as that sounds, I was elated. I already planned to offer to let my cousin stay with me when I get a studio, but I doubt I could support two people. The guy might not be good for her, but there is very little that can be worse for a person than living with my sociopathic aunt. My grandma asked me to find out the boyfriend's last name (I do have his Facebook, so that would be easy enough) so that she could do a background check on him. There is no way in hell I am violating R's trust like that. Even if the boy turns out to be bad for her, she is an adult and that is an invasion of privacy. I sincerely doubt that will make her feel in control of her life. 

I talked to my cousin. Her voice sounded loopy, presumably from the drugs that my family told me she is on. It scares the ever loving fuck out of me. Logically, I know most people don't go from sane to permanently insane. However my mom had drug induced psychosis. When her mind snapped, it was gone. There was never a truly lucid moment again, where I felt like I was speaking to the same woman who raised me. I know this isn't the norm, but why is my cousin still on drugs? Why is she still in the mental hospital, when her mother often got released after only a day? I am terrified that she'll never be the same person again. 

My cousin asked me if there was anything weird on her Facebook. I hadn't been on in awhile so I told her I didn't know. I have no idea what to say when I speak to her again. Yes, they do not indicate a mentally sane state, however I feel like it isn't anything you wouldn't see on a teenager's Facebook. I do remember my Uncle saying that R had been sounding like her mother recently on Facebook. He is not close to her at all, and it's a little galling that no one who was close to her saw this coming, but he did. I plan to not bring it up the next time I speak with her, and I don't know what I'll say if she asks. 

I referred to what happened as her ""psychotic break"" while on the phone. She got very upset. Her first words were ""I didn't have a- that's not- I didn't hurt anyone!"" How heartbreaking is that? I explained to her that no one said she did,  and I was rushing and speaking so much that for some reason I cannot fathom I accidentally let slip that our grandma had said she made threats, and grandma heard it from R's mom. I explained quickly that our aunt had talked to her mom before anyone else, before her mom had been given a chance to inflate the story, and the worse she had said to the cops was ""I will be mad!"" She calmed down, and I feel like there is a decent chance she won't remember that part of the conversation, since it was so quick and she is so drugged up. 

Our grandma and our aunt both told me ""I told her maybe she isn't even mentally ill. She always has to be so strong, and anyone, even a normal person would go crazy if they grew up with R's mom."" 

When I talked to R she said **""the doctors are saying that they want to put my on schizophrenic medications. I don't want to be on medication I don't need.""**

Now, I will admit that this last year I have made sure to tell my cousin ""a lot has been happening lately, make sure you take care of your mental health."" I do wonder a bit now if maybe this contributed to her breakdown. She always seemed to take things in stride like they weren't a big deal, and maybe my words made everything seem heavier to her. And yes, a lot has been happening.

But I cannot help but worry that my family has made a big mistake in telling her ""maybe this was just a fluke."" Nearly every person in our family has some kind of mental disorder. I've seen what happens when people whose disorders include a warped perception of reality do not take their meds. It is not pretty. 

I told her, ""I would listen to the doctors, just tell them everything you experience, and ask for more information and what they want to diagnose you with.""

She got upset again, ""What do you think I've been doing all this time I've been here!"" 

She would act happy to talk to me, but when I brought up things to do with what happened, I often got the feeling from her responses that she felt attacked and like she had to defend herself. 

When we first started talking I asked her if she wanted to talk about what happened or just chat. I didn't really get a straight answer since she was loopy, but I wanted to hear it from her. When I asked her what she remembered and she mentioned the neighbor she said, ""I also yelled at the neighbor a bit. He was looking at me again. I don't like him, he's pervy."" I asked her what he did that made her think he is pervy and she didn't respond for a second and said, ""I don't want to talk about it."" I'd like to think he just leered at her or made some inappropriate jokes, but that does seem significant so I figure I should message it.

Overall she was very happy and loopy on the phone call. She said that she got to talk to me, her boyfriend, and her mom (who is also in a psych hospital as of two days ago). She is very fixated on the boyfriend, and it worries me. I asked her if he has any experience with mental illness or mentally ill people and she said yes. That's- good?


**Well, if anyone actually made it this far, thank you. Now my problem is I don't know how I should talk to her, what I should avoid saying, ect. I would also like to know if she will ever be her normal self again. My mom, who had drug induced psychosis, often hallucinated and talked to things that weren't there. Our family kind of assumed she was schizophrenic, and I cannot remember if she was ever diagnosed with that or not. People on reddit have told me that doesn't sound like she had schizophrenia. Nonetheless this really freaks me out, since (like I said) when my mom snapped her mind was gone for good.**

I'm gay so my only options are either in vitro-fertilization (which I'd rather use my partners DNA if he were to have healthier genes or at least less probability of passing abnormal genes on) or adoption. I'd prefer adoption because I'm a big advocate against reproduction in an over populated world when there are so many unwanted kids. Anyway I just wanted to know how an adoptive agency would react to something like this. I realize it's almost futile for a gay dude with schizophrenia to even dream of adopting in America but just wanted to know.

Could my partner even adopt as a single man with me in the picture?

I guess while I'm at it. How would an in vetro-fertilization go over for someone in my shoes? I mean would a doctor be willing to do such a thing for me?

Little history if it helps. Been committed 5 times, most recently this last March but this is a question for the future. I'm on good meds now and I have a good job working with disabled people. I only have one year left of college (majoring in biology and philosophy). I am also planning on taking EMT/paramedic courses as a fall back plan. I also plan on going to grad school for biology wishing to do research on cave ecology. 

I live in Nebraska on the border of Iowa by the way but it's not a karst area so I doubt I will call it home post grad school because I plan on doing a lot of spelunking later in life.

Any advice, relevant experiences, or just any type of knowledge on the subject would be much appreciated.",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

If you want the vid link mention it and I can find it again and link it but just writing my thoughts right now. 

He saw a random video on reddit and afterward he was really freaked out in a way I have never seen before. We've been together for 7 years, married for a little over 3 of them. I always knew he was ""quirky"" and ""imaginative"", but when he showed me the video it really unnerved me that this had been happening to him for years and years. In his words and my poor memory he basically said, ""I thought everyone had this happen but this tells me they don't."" I watched it a few times and started to ask him questions. He was very uncomfortable and was as open with me as he could be and that is when it all started. This was in December 2012. I started doing research and found schizophrenia to have the most common denominator, with possible schizoaffective being more accurate. He has not been diagnosed yet because it has taken some time to encourage him to get help without making him feel pushed into it. He is a very private person and does not like the idea of telling a stranger about his experiences.

I've never done a post here before so I am sorry if it is too long, I asked him if he wanted to do one and he said he is not ready yet. I said, ""Well maybe I should do my own."" and he said that was ok with him so here I am.

He is very apprehensive about seeking help and I have had a horrible time trying to get him an appointment. I have major depressive disorder and have my own psychiatrist so I reached out to him first and emailed him the video. His reply was that he does not treat his patients' spouses but there were others at his practice. My husband has very clear feelings now about who he may or may not want to talk to so I didn't pursue it a lot. I did reach out to a family member he trusts that is bi-polar to see if she could direct us in any way. She tried to get him an appointment as a new patient that would not be 2-3 months from now but it didn't work out well. He would have had to call to confirm it and in Dec. he wasn't comfortable to do that so I didn't push it. 

Last week I saw my doc and in my 15 minute check in for meds and such I couldn't help talking about this which he understood. He then told me that if my husband would not get help, this would likely progress and he recommended I leave him for my own well being and even safety. I told him my spouse is not violent nor aggressive to me but he said if it progresses, his frustration with his own perception vs. everyone else's, he could become dangerous. I am in no way ever going to abandon my sweet man in what has presented itself to be his highest time of need. I have two children from a previous marriage so I am vigilant toward any ""behaviors"" and I am not worried for my kids at this time. I did tell him about my convo with my doc because it bothered me, it was so serious of him to say with not a lot of information and I respect him after seeing him for over 3 years. 

Idk, I guess I am here because I have gotten him an appt in a week but he has read all about the doctor and says he went to a diploma mill and he doesn't think he can trust him. He wants to question his credentials after the appt but is also freaked out about opening up to a stranger that doesn't look ""good"" on the web. I asked him if I should ask my doc what he thinks since the guy is his affiliate and he said I could. My doc replied that he doesn't know the doc well and is unfamiliar with his work. I asked if I should try for someone else at the facility and he recommended another person he said he thought would be a better fit. My husband wanted to talk to a woman, this woman is also a PA which he didn't like but after I gave him more info on a PA he is more willing and does like that she is female as the doc set for next week is male.

He isn't ""in crisis"", from what I read online and talked to my cousin about, but I have learned some pretty scary things in the last couple of weeks that make me worried. I don't think he is in danger of hurting himself or others, he does not want to go to ER and is very worried about being ""locked up"". I am not a professional though and I do not want to make a mistake that could affect my husband in a seriously negative way. 

His symptoms do not seem to be very severe from what he is able to tell me about. We have spent many nights since my doctor appt discussing what he has experienced, how long it has been happening and what he can recall has happened. It's so hard for him because he can't tell if things were ""real"" or not. He also feels that there may be a plot against him involving all of this in which I am involved. He knows me through and through and doesn't believe this truly, but he still thinks it could be happening. From what he has been able to say, he has had auditory hallucinations, has delusions, and he does have trouble communicating what he experiences. 

One delusion that I found very shocking for myself, not in a negative way, more of a concerned way, is that he does not believe a bullet can kill him. He was also involved in a serious car accident over 10 years ago and he thinks he may have died or is living in an alternate version of reality since...not different much from the one he was in but it feels ""off"". He has also mentioned he is afraid to ever own a gun because of what he might do. I am guessing he might try to ""prove"" if it can kill him which honestly does frighten me. We don't own one though so it's not an imminent threat.

He is so afraid of seeing a professional, he is afraid he is making this up because it is interesting to do. I have told him that isn't something people would usually do and that his personality is not attention seeking so I rule that out. I suppose I just would like any thoughts for us dealing with this very new thing. I can't believe I never noticed, I have always said Oh if someone needs help those close to them should be able to recognize it and here I am after 7 years realizing that different things I just chalked up to his personality may be a serious illness. 

I guess I can say more later in comments, I'm sure this is incredibly long. Any words of encouragement are very welcome, he is just so scared of the realization that things are not ""normal"" as he perceived his entire life. His earliest memories of when things may have been odd go back to age 8 or 9. He is now in his mid-30's and has never told anyone the things he has told me that he can remember.

Here's my story:

About 3 years and 3 months ago, I had my first psychosis. I heard voices, people were talking to me, despite being an atheist I got hyper religious and was convinced of being the Messiahs, and I was convinced that I fell in love with a woman I haven't seen for years and was never interested in, and that I was in fact in love with nearly every woman I ever got to know. I behaved really strange, really insane, all my friends knew that something was going on.

Then I got institutionalized, given anti-psychotics and released after two weeks when I was better. 
So I thought, well that's it. I had one psychosis, about two months long, and now I'm fine again. Well I got incredibly lazy, couldn't pay my bills on time or keep my flat clean or brush my teeth regularly or leave the house when not absolutely necessary, but surely, no positive symptoms anymore, no hallucinations or delusions.

I went down with my meds, three years after this incident, slowly reducing them together with my psychiatrist.

And then, two weeks ago, I had another psychosis.

But this time it was different. It started with a woman from high school writing me on facebook. Haven't seen her for years, and she wrote a bit about herself and what she was doing and asked what I was up to. Instead of writing just a few paragraphs back, in total, I wrote about 68 pages full with text about myself. I was forced to. I couldn't help it. I had to write, and I had to send it to her. I knew she wasn't that interested in my life, and I kept apologizing for the flood in every letter. But I couldn't stop. Also I wouldn't sleep anymore, or drink or eat much. Only writing. 
This went on for 7 days straight, then I realized that I was most probably in a psychosis, as what I was writing was pretty insane, I got a terrible fear attack and the next three days I spent writing myself out of madness, if that makes any sense. I just corrected myself and my insane writings with every letter I sent, and the letters started to make sense again.

And now, for the biggest twist of my life, sixth sense is nothing in comparison:

On the last day, that was two weeks ago, I realized that I was psychotic (or at least exhibiting strong positive symptoms) all the time. Not only for the past three years, even before that I had strong symptoms. I haven't felt as sane as the last two weeks, for at least six years, but probably even longer, I can't honestly say when things started to get weird, maybe even as early as in high school, up to 12 years ago.


So yeah, I was like, ""oh, I WAS PSYCHOTIC ALL THE TIME, now that explains a lot really...""


Now I'm an atheist again, and can't belive I've spent the last three years constantly on pseudo-philosophic, esoteric, paranormal, and religious boards on the internet.

I can't believe I sent unwelcomed love letters to women in the past three years, that I thought I was in love with, when clearly, I'm not.

I can't believe I still heard voices, it just didn't hit me as strange enough when people were talking about me on the bus or on the streets,  only now that it suddenly stopped I go oh.. yeah.

I stopped arguing with myself in my head, I stopped speaking things out loud, I stopped thinking things loud all the time. It's just so beautifully calm in my head right now, and I can think logically, rationally and clearly again. It's like night/day in my head.

So now I already cleaned my whole flat, payed all my bills, ordered some new clothes, went outside a few times to meet with friends outdoors, I have the urge to exercise and leave the house again, and I feel something like a drive again, something like optimism, I now have an outlook on life again, and could imagine that in about half a year, if things stay like that with me, I'd start working again or go back to university.


Tl;Dr: First psychosis made things go from bad to worse, stayed this way for over three years, second psychosis made things go from worse to excellent, like years before the first psychosis, I can't even remember anymore having ever been this sane.


My psychiatrist doesn't say much about it, only that I have to be careful now and see that I sleep enough and so on, but he doesn't really have an explanation or a prognosis for me. 

Now I only have two real questions left: How long am I going to stay in this sane state of mind, and what can I do for it?",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

Moscow Psychiatric Institute- fasting reported to be a successful treatment for various mental disorders

A) Although psychological drugs only temporarily alter the mental states by affecting the brain, fasting may free the brain forever (Bragg &amp;amp; Bragg, 1999).

The useful book on immense health benefits of fasting- The Miracle Of Fasting, 51th Edition: Proven Throughout History For Physical, Mental, &amp;amp; Spiritual Rejuvenation by Paul C. Bragg, Patricia Bragg 

B) Since the last 50 years therapeutic fasting has been found to be the most effective treatment for schizophrenia in Russia.

Beginning in the 1970s, researchers recorded success treating some psychiatric conditions with therapeutic fasting, most notably schizophrenia (Cott, 1974).

Fasting Helped in Schizophrenia



In the field of psychiatry, Yuri Nikoliav of the Moscow Psychiatric Institute, fasted ten thousand patients diagnosed with chronic refractory schizophrenia, a recurring condition characterized by gross distortions of reality, which is resistant to treatment. The patients, who had been treated with more conventional types of psychiatry and had not responded, were placed on water fasts lasting from twenty-five to thirty days. Nikoliav's fasting regimen was successful in more than 70% of all cases. The results were so impressive that the large majority of the schizophrenic patients at the 3,000-bed research center requested admission to the unit.

New York Psychiatrist Alan Cott spent two weeks observing Nikoliav's fasting treatments. Cott then undertook an experimental controlled fasting program as part of a research project at the Gracie Square Hospital in New York. The patients in Cott’s study had been previously diagnosed as schizophrenic for at least five years and had failed to improve under previous forms of treatment. After treating 28 schizophrenics, Cott reported that over 70% of those who completed the fast remained well, providing they stayed on a special low-fat diet.

In his book What Really Causes Schizophrenia?, Harold Foster calls the therapeutic fasting of schizophrenics as one of the ""five most effective unconventional approaches to the treatment of schizophrenia."" Foster subscribes to a branch of medicine called ""orthomolecular medicine."" Orthomolecular psychiatry is a type of orthomolecular medicine whose proponents argue that dietary supplements and other treatments can be effective in treating mental illness. Linus Pauling, winner of two Nobel prizes, coined the term ""orthomolecular psychiatry"" in 1968 to refer to the treatment of psychiatric illnesses with substances (such as vitamins, minerals, enzymes, trace elements, co-enzymes) that are normally present in the body. In orthomolecular psychiatry, high amounts of vitamins are sometimes used, not to correct a deficiency per se, but to create a more optimal biochemical environment. Fasting is another method used in orthomolecular psychiatry.

Hey, everybody. I've lurked on this sub for a long time because my partner (who I'll call ""G"") is schizophrenic and has OCD. I've tried very hard to understand her and her illnesses. 

I'm here because I need help as a partner, friend, and lover. Please know that I really love G, and I'm sharing my experiences to hopefully connect with someone out there who knows where I'm coming from. 

--Quick History--
G was officially diagnosed with schizophrenia about two years ago. A year before that, when she got unfairly terminated from a job she loved, she had a psychotic break immediately after. Ever since then, it's been a struggle for her, her parents, and me to find a steady sense of normalcy. 

--The Good Stuff--
G is very caring and sweet. She takes care of me when I'm sick, and she has a lot of love to give. She regularly takes her medication and goes to therapy and RI meetings. I'm very proud of her for sticking to all of that.

--The Problems--
At times, it's difficult to feel that partner-to-partner connection both emotionally and physically. I'm the one who goes to work (she's on SSI) and drives everywhere. I'm the one who cleans most of the house and makes sure we're fed. 

And even though sex isn't everything in a relationship, it used to be great. Now it's almost nonexistent because of:
- Medication 
We're both on meds; I've been on antidepressants for about two years. I feel numb most of the time and my libido has plummeted from 60 to 0. 
- Weight gain
When G was on Saphris, she put on approximately 60lbs in two months. I was all-too-willing to dive into comfort foods, and over the past two years, I've put on at least 70lbs myself. If I cared more and actually felt a sense of pride, I would lose the weight. Right now my best friend is ice cream. 
- Hygiene
G doesn't want to shower more than a couple times a week and she doesn't like to wear deodorant. It makes it very difficult to want to cuddle or get intimate. 
- Immaturity
After everything, this has been the biggest turnoff. 

Over the past three years, G has seemed to steadily regress emotionally and behaviorally. If she doesn't get her way, she'll throw (what I can only describe as) a tantrum. Sometimes she'll lose her lucidity and it turns into a full-blown psychotic episode; sometimes she stays lucid for the whole thing. Note: I'm not trying to belittle schizophrenia, and I do know a psychotic episode is different than a tantrum. 

I'm worried that the tantrums are fueled by an underlying sense of entitlement, which is ultimately hindering G's ability to get better. Her mother--who really is a wonderful, loving person--has always been willing to give G whatever she's wanted, especially if G has begged, yelled loud enough, and/or threatened to kill herself. G's mother hasn't known what else to do, and she thinks she's helping. I don't give in that easily to G's demands, and sometimes that makes me a ""bad person."" She gets upset and insists that I comfort her because she doesn't know ways to soothe herself. 

During G's rages (and even when she mildly disagrees with something), she immediately hits low below the belt. She calls me names and waves any and all of my failures in my face. She'll apologize later, but then she'll say something like, ""If you had just done what I wanted, I wouldn't have gotten so mad."" And it's next-to-impossible for me to feel affectionate, let alone be in the mood for sex, after seeing her acting that way. Then she makes me feel guilty about not wanting sex. 

I don't want it to seem like I've been an angel through all of this. Although, I've made a point particularly over the past few months to not insult her when we argue, in the past, I've screamed at her, too. I've called her lazy and selfish and other really horrible things. On occasion, things have even gotten a little physical on both sides. Until all of this began unraveling, I didn't even know I was capable of anything close to how I've behaved, and it makes me feel like an ugly, horrible person.

G also lashes out in public if she's bored or not getting enough attention from her family or me. At times, she'll also have a mini break from reality and forget where she is and how to behave. Just the other night, her parents, she, and I were at a restaurant, and she burped and farted right there at the table. I was mortified. I'm not completely comfortable going out in public because I don't know what will happen. 

--Longer History--
When G had her psychotic break, I took on a second full-time job so she could have time to start healing. I also took on most of the meal prep and house upkeep. Needless to say, it wasn't an easy adjustment, and I wish I had handled things better emotionally for both her and me. Tensions started running high because I felt abandoned in our relationship. 

That summer, her parents and I organized an expensive trip to a specialized treatment center in California. I even borrowed money from a couple of my incredible friends to make it all work. The process killed me financially, but I didn't care because it was only money; I was willing to sacrifice anything to help G get started on the road to recovery. Unfortunately, the treatment wasn't as effective as we'd hoped. 

About a year and a half after working two jobs, I broke. I had a mental breakdown and lost both jobs in the process. One was my dream job, and it still hurts not to be there because it felt like home. 

I'm still not entirely back on my feet. I have a job that keeps us going, but I'm in the process of declaring bankruptcy. I'd hardly ever been late on a payment before this whole thing, and now my credit score is shit. 

Every day, I know I love G. I know that I'm on her side, and that she's fighting to get back to where she was before her break. I'm just so tired. It's exhausting having two worlds on my shoulders while I constantly worry about the future. She keeps trying to encourage marriage and babies because we're not getting any younger, but I can barely handle everything we have going right now. And honestly, I already feel like a parent sometimes. It makes my heart ache. 

Is this it? Is this what life will always be like? Am I an idiot for not giving up hope? Someone please tell me this is just a rough patch and it'll get better.

For several weeks (or months) at a time, she'll be able to hold on decent conversations, feed herself, clothe herself, and basically live autonomously (although she doesn't have the follow through to hold down a job). But on her down swings, she has audio hallucinations, she screams at the top of her lungs, and can even get violent towards anybody nearby (my parents have had flesh bit off of them). But even on her up-swings, she still needs to be kept under watchful eye, since her worst down-swings can happen within hours.

She is currently 30 years old and living with our parents, who are both in their sixties and are aging quite quickly, and who have spent all of their savings and have gone deeply into debt trying to treat her and manage her symptoms (using both conventional and alternative medicine). 

Right now, my wife and I deeply stressed by what seems to be a spiraling train wreck waiting to happen. My dad is working himself into the ground with no prospects of retirement, and any day will collapse from sheer exhaustion or heart attack. My mother has worsening health problems of her own. And even if they survive the next twenty years, their steady income will not — within 5-10 years, I do not believe my dad will be able to work anymore.

My wife and I are currently students starting a family of our own. And quite frankly, we cannot allow my sister to live with us — it is not an environment in which we want to raise young children in (even if it were safe to do so, which it very possibly is not). My other sister and her husband also have young children. And none of us have incomes that will fund the live-in care she really needs. At the very best, we could supplement or assist with rent — but she can't make do with rent, she needs supervisory care.

In Utah, there are simply no options for long-term live-in care. Even the state hospital has a policy and history of simply discharging patients on their up-swings. We've been assured by those in-the-know and first-hand experience that if my sister goes to the state hospital she will not likely get the care she needs, and will likely be discharged after a month or two of improvement (which she regularly shows just before her subsequent down-swings).

What she needs is a long-term live-in facility where she can stay as long as needed to *truly* be stabilized (instead of just a two-three month up-swing), who will not release her to the streets until she demonstrates that she can hold a long-term job and provide for herself (for a year or more — she's had her worst down-swings after 7-8 months of near-normality). Utah has no such facility (private or public), and any state that does, such facilities are prohibitively expensive (based on our research, in the hundreds of thousands a year).

In short, unless a super-rich benefactor comes along, in every imaginable scenario (at least in the state where we live), my sister ends up homeless on the streets. It's causing me and my wife sleepless nights (such as tonight), thinking about the responsibility that will very soon be ours, but which we cannot take on (for both family and financial reasons). But we love our sister, and I've soaked my pillow at night at the thought of her living on the streets — we will not let that happen if we can avoid it. But short of a miracle, how can we avoid it?

There's support groups (like NAMI), but they haven't offered much in the way of tangible options (at least for Utah and the surrounding states). There's state insurance (medicare? medicaid?), but due to some quirk in Utah law, she doesn't qualify, and just what good would that do if Utah doesn't offer the needed facilities in the first place?

I just need to vent, I guess. I welcome suggestions. Simultaneously, over the years, I've been told there's just not a lot of options, and the very thought of it hurts. ",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

I am male (27), sister is female (32). She has two children, one of which lives with her (6 year old boy lives with her, the 11 year old lives with his father). She lives with my parents and aunt. She was diagnosed with anxiety disorder about five years ago, then reassessed and diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia about a year and a half ago.

She has been placed on several different medications, some of which worked better than others. She has some good days, but many bad days. She has problems with taking the medication consistently. She becomes quite paranoid about where the medication came from, the people who are giving it to her (my parents), how the medication was presented to her (e.g. a purple cup is a bad idea), and the like. She sometimes has delusions that her loved ones are out to get her, evil, or supernatural creatures in human skin, so she has a lot of trouble trusting those who are close to her.

Some of these episodes are so severe that she leaves the house, is picked up by local police, brought to the hospital, and has a 1-2 week-long stay at a local hospital. This has happened five times since she was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, but it is becoming much more frequent lately.

It is difficult to track, because they do not deem her unfit to make her own medical decisions. However, she is paranoid/delusional enough of our parents that she won't allow them to have access to any of her PHI, including where she is staying, further medication and diagnoses, etc.

I do not live close to home (about a day's car ride away), but I would still like to help. Especially when I am visiting. It seems that she is less delusional or paranoid about me (it still happens), most likely because she has less regular contact with me. Growing up, she always relied on me as an emotional touchstone, even with the age difference. However, I have always been rather independent of my family, both emotionally and financially, so I only visit once every three or four months (mostly holidays).

My mother is frustrated that she is powerless to help her daughter, along with the emotional toll this disorder has caused her, such as changing my sister's personality entirely into an oftentimes hateful, distrustful woman.

About me: I have an educational and professional background in Psychology. Though it is not related Schizophrenia, I do have a decent understanding of how the disorder progresses, prognosis, recommended cognitive/behavioral/medication treatment, and the like. I still feel stuck, however. There is only so much a doctor can recommend without first-hand.

My question is rather simple: From your own experience, how do you think I (or my mother) could best help her? How can we best encourage her to take her medication short of shoving it down her throat, which obviously will only reinforce her paranoia and delusions, despite the medication? When she is having an especially paranoid or delusional episode, how can we best help her ride it out? She is generally not perceptive to our advice, and when having an episode, sitting calmly and eliminating excessive external stimuli hasn't really helped. She is naturally manipulative, so she is generally able to convince my mother (but not myself) that she is better, even if she is not. This leads to behaviors that are dangerous to her well-being, like taking a long walk (hours) late at night (past midnight), which can't be stopped without physically restraining her.

Personal experience with how your family helped you is more than welcome.

As a note: Putting her in a residential program, though probably for the best, is not an option. She still has been deemed mentally capable, so we are unable to force her into one against her will. She is not willing to go, even on her most lucid days. Finally, my mother is unreceptive to the idea, and I can't compel her to change her mind, even if I believe it is the best thing to do for my sister.","['pobj', 'pobj', 'compound']",-1,neu_vader

I was denied on my initial application (applied without the lawyer's help) and was told that nearly all cases are denied at first.

My lawyer used to work with the judges who look over the appeals of whether or not someone is eligible for benefits. So, the judges know him personally.

Also, the law firm I chose rejects 9 out of every 10 people who come to it because they only want to put forward the strongest cases. They told me they were certain that I would get benefits.

However, my lawyer told me that to get a hearing for the appeals process, I will have to wait 12-18 months from when the appeal is put in.

This is quite a while. However, I do get back payment of up to 12 months from date of application.

The lawyer will take 25% of these back benefits as payment if I receive benefits and will take nothing if I do not receive benefits.

So, now it is just a game of waiting...

Another piece of advice. My lawyer told me to get an individual therapist (I go to group therapy and have a psychiatrist who prescribes medication). He says that having an individual therapist looks good because the courts want to award benefits to individuals who are striving to ""get better"". They do not like to give benefits to those who look like they have given up.

So, it looks like I will be getting an individual therapist again even though I feel they are not worth the money. My last one was $200 per session for cognitive behavioral therapy. After a few sessions, I could do it on my own and didn't need the therapist.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

After a year of court hearings and rejecting plea offers, the prosecutors offered me a ""no contest plea"" and dropped the felonies. My sentencing will be on 5/29 for misdemeanors of stalking, criminal mischief, and institutional vandalism. I believe I was wrongfully arrested and should have initially been taken to a hospital for treatment. Please read the entire story for perspective as this is a strange case.

#Prior to incident:  
This happened over a year ago, in 2014. It was during my last year of graduate school. A few months before, I was diagnosed with ADHD and started Adderall to treat my symptoms. My mental health started deteriorating as I started to develop insomnia, paranoia, delusional thoughts, and auditory hallucinations. I began to believe that a close friend of mine was in town, and looking for me. I spent several days walking around town looking for clues. I bought 2 bus tickets to go home to NYC on Saturday for my birthday. On Friday night, I walked 3 miles across town to a McDonald's where I stayed awake the whole night. I threw out my smartphone, tablet, and jewelry out of paranoia. The next morning, I walked back to my apartment, stopping in a campus bathroom where I cut my wrist using my keys. For perspective, I am a tall male with a wide body frame. I also happen to have brown skin so I'm not the most amicable-looking person. I have no previous criminal record.

#Day of incident:  
It was my 24th birthday, on a Saturday. During my manic state, I posted a handwritten note in the elevator that read ""You're beautiful"" as a sort of motivational/inspirational quote. Around 4pm, my delusional thoughts led me to believe that my friend was in the apartment above me. I had never been to that apartment before and didn't know who lived there. I grabbed a box of chocolates I had previously bought for Valentine's Day, and headed to the apartment without my glasses. The box had the words ""Where из она?"" and ""She's beautiful"" handwritten on it. A girl answered the door, I gave her the box, and said something like, ""Give this to her"", then walked back to my apartment.

A short while later, I had more delusions that maybe my friend wanted me to go into the apartment to see her. I went back upstairs and entered the apartment. I couldn't see very well without my glasses but I assumed the first girl I saw was my friend. I called out my friend's name to her, but she seemed hysterical and I couldn't really understand what she was saying. While the other girls were hysterically shouting at me, the first girl walked to her room and locked herself in. I followed her because I thought she was my friend and couldn't understand why she wasn't talking to me. When I realized the door was locked, I went to sit on their couch and turned on the TV.

I believe the girls were telling me to leave, and that they didn't know me. The state of mind I was in couldn't comprehend why my friends would be kicking me out, so I thought they were sarcastically joking. I assumed everyone in the apartment knew me so I stayed on the couch. I sniffed some items like potpourri and the chocolates I brought before eating one.

It didn't feel like a long time passed, but the cops showed up while I was sitting on the couch with my feet propped up on the table. I then realized that something must be wrong so I cooperated with the officers. I believe they explained that I was trespassing and asked me if I knew that what I was doing is wrong and I think I agreed with them. They gave me a breathalyzer and asked me if I took any drugs. I didn't take Adderall in a few days so I said no. I was arrested and charged with a ""criminal trespassing"" felony. They did not tell me my Miranda rights until later. According to the police report, I stated that ""I knew I was trespassing"" which was a huge misunderstanding (I did not premeditatedly walk into the apartment knowing I was trespassing, and I did not comprehend requests to leave). The report also stated that one of the girls found my note in the elevator, recognized my handwriting, and started ""hysterically crying"" because she apparently thought it was targeting her. It also states that I wrote the word ""Whore"" on the chocolate box (it was actually ""Where""). 

The way the report was worded makes it seem like I was antagonizing the girls and holding them hostage in the apartment while I menacingly pranced around, walking on their furniture and trying to enter their locked rooms. In reality, I spent most of the time sitting on the couch. To make matters worse, several local media outlets published public articles about my arrest with information from the police report. I was also suspended from my university.

#During incarceration:  
I was processed, spoke to some kind of counselor, then placed in a holding cell for the night. I don't think I said anything sensible to the counselor. My paranoia, delusional thoughts, and hallucinations were exacerbated and I thought I was part of some big prank show that the whole town was in on. I didn't think I could possibly be arrested just for walking into my friend's apartment. I started making art with the toilet paper, which led them to place me in another cell without toilet paper or a sleeping pad (which confused me more). I thought that I was meant to escape the cell like a game in the Saw movies, so I looked around and found the only tangible object: a vent cap. I bent it and broke it off, causing $190 in damages. I also did many nonsensical things like talking to the voices in my head, yelling, ripping my sleeves off, and putting all my clothes in the toilet among other things. I was reported as behaving erratically. It was also reported that I later told an officer that I ""broke the vent cap for fun"", which I do not recall saying but is very possible given the state of mind I was in. The misdemeanors of ""institutional vandalism"" and ""criminal mischief"" were added to my charges.

The next morning, they removed me from the cell. I was naked so they put a velcro vest on me and strapped me to a wheelchair. I still didn't understand what was going on. A nurse spoke to me and eventually a judge (via video) but I wasn't able to think rationally as I was still delusional/psychotic after not sleeping for two nights. The nurse asked me if I took any drugs and I said no. I was then placed in a solitary confinement cell which they called ""suicide watch"" because of the visible cut on my wrist.

I was given a sleeping pad and the velcro vest to wear. The lights were kept on 24/7 which made it difficult to sleep. I was confused and still psychotic for several days. I didn't fully understand why I was arrested. I was assigned a public defender and was able to speak to her a few days after. She showed me the police report and explained to me that the girls in the apartment didn't know me, to which I was still a little confused. She told me the ""victims were traumatized"" by the incident. She encouraged me to plead ""not guilty"" at my first hearing. After about 9 days in solitary, my family was finally able to make the 5 hour drive from NYC to bail me out (the bond was 10% of $80,000). The entire time I spent in jail, I was never given a single phone call.

#Post-Incarceration:  
After being released and going home to NYC, I admitted myself to the ER of a local hospital as I still felt symptoms of Schizophrenia/Psychosis and I was traumatized from being in solitary. I was treated for a week and diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive Type. I was admitted to the ER again a few weeks later after an anxiety attack and received another week of treatment. I was assigned a monthly psychiatrist and medicated with anti-psychotics, along with a weekly therapist which I have been compliant with for over a year. I gained about 50 lbs since using the meds so my psychiatrist discontinued them as I haven't had any symptoms since using them.

Throughout the year, I've had to drive back and forth to PA to attend monthly/bi-monthly court hearings to avoid breaking my bail bond and going back to jail. The prosecutors originally wanted me to serve more time in jail and offered me unreasonable plea deals. My lawyer (public defender) was pretty pessimistic at the time and didn't think I would get off with probation. The prosecutors added an additional misdemeanor of ""stalking"" (intent to cause emotional distress during multiple encounters) and a felony of ""burglary"" (trespassing with intent to commit a crime). During the summer of 2014, they eventually offered to drop some of the charges if I accepted a plea offer for 6 months of house arrest, but I would have had to serve it in PA instead of NYC. I rejected the plea deals because I didn't think I should be punished for having a mental disorder.

My lawyer was later able to have a forensic psychologist evaluate me. He confirmed that I had Schizoaffective Disorder triggered by the Adderall. The prosecutors still wanted me to serve house arrest, then they wanted to have their own psychologist evaluate me. At this point, I wanted to take the case to a jury trial and plead insanity, but my lawyer warned me that I could face several years of jail for the felony/misdemeanor charges if I was found ""Guilty but Mentally Ill"" under PA law. After filing for a continuance several times, the prosecutors never got a psychologist to evaluate me. Instead, they hired one to review the report from the forensic psych that previously evaluated me, and decided to offer me a plea deal for probation. My lawyer said they wanted me to serve several years of probation, which I thought was unreasonable. They then offered me a ""no contest plea"" for only the misdemeanor charges. My lawyer was optimistic about the no contest plea so I went along with it because the other best option was a risky jury trial.

#To recap: 
 I was originally arrested for criminal trespassing (felony). Burglary (felony) and stalking (misdemeanor) were later added to that incident. Trespassing and burglary were eventually dropped for the no contest plea. I am still facing charges for the broken vent cap. In total, I am facing misdemeanors of 1) stalking, 2) institutional vandalism, and 3) criminal mischief.

My final sentencing will be on Friday, May 29 -- over 15 months after the incident took place. I was able to conjure 15+ character reference letters from friends/family along with a progress report from my psychiatrist/therapist. My lawyer is optimistic that I'll only face a short amount of probation. The worst I can receive is a few months in jail with several years of probation.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

Specifically schizo-affective w/ depression. I can give more info if needed but here is what currently is going on. It's killing me to watch her suffer. I feel like there is nothing I can do.

She was in the hospital from 8-21 Aug in the behavior health facility at our local hospital. That was her 3rd time there in the past 4 months. While she was there they increased her geodon from 20 to 40 twice a day. She also takes cymbalta as well as cogentin. She has also been taking thyroid meds for the past 4 yrs because she had cancer in her thyroid and she had surgery to remove the thyroid. A year after her thyroid surgery she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia..none of the meds they gave her brought any relief at all. 


Since she came home on the 21st of Aug she was doing fine. No problems at all. It seemed that this go round every thing to be stabilized. Even her back pain from the fibro eased up. She has been taking her meds as usual and getting good nights sleep. All through the weekend she was doing well, but eating less and less. 

On Monday morning her hands &amp; fingers started to swell up causing pain and discomfort. At the same time she started feeling unstable and confused, just like when she was experiencing a psychosis. I took her to the ER and than drew blood and tested for everything. The results came back fine. The doctors couldn't figure out what the cause was. As far as we know there are no drug interactions with any of the meds she's taking. I've searched all over the internet and found nothing. After a few hours the symptoms started to fade. The swelling went down and she was feeling less confused. By the time we got home she was fine..tired but fine.

Tuesday morning came and it started again, except not as intense as the day before. She toughed it out through out the day, but was still struggling. She didn't eat much of anything that day but did drink an ensure drink and a few bites of a burger. By 730pm she felt much better.

Wednesday morning it happens again. For most of the morning she toughed it out again. Not really eating and by 3pm I took her back to the ER. Same results as before; they don't have a clue to what is causing this. The symptoms were still present when we went home, just not as intense.

Thursday same thing all over again. Not as intense but she toughed it out. Once again not really eating but did drink an ensure. By 9pm she felt much better, just drained.


Friday (today) the morning started as expected. She drank an ensure, but that's all she's had today. She toughed it out once again even though today was pretty intense. She is in bed as of writing this post. She doesn't want to go back to the ER because there is nothing they can do. Our family doctor can't do anything either.

But yet she continues to suffer. This is tearing me apart. I am out of ideas. She doesn't have an appointment with a psychiatrist until next Friday to discuss management of meds , but that's still not going to address what happening now.

Does anyone have any ideas on what to do because I am at a loss for words. Thank you all for any responses.",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

Some days, taking the medicine is much too terrifying of a task for me to handle :( Before I was ill, I wondered why some people struggled with such a simple task.

Ok, I have been looking to get opinions on this for some time and have not found the outlet. This is fairly unique, but I'll keep it as brief as possible.
I'm on disability for a mental illness, Schizophrenia that has manifested a few years ago around the age symptoms generally first show in a male. This episode culminated to the point that my parents called the police on me because they worried about me.
I was arrested for making a false statement to the police, resisting arrest and vandalism for throwing eggs at my neighbors house because I was hearing him talk about me. On three separate occasions I was arrested.
At this point I was locked up and no one would take my call. My Dad would hang up when I insisted someone was sneaking into my house and I heard people talking or saw lights and objects moving when no one else was there. I lost my 2 bedroom place and thankfully my father and brother put my stuff in storage (pulling out the valuable stuff to use or in their words keep safe). I was already on rocky footing with my girlfriend of the time and that went sour once I didn't call back because I was in Jail. Basically I was on an involuntary hold without being on one since I was in Jail and I couldn't get Bail because the Judge refused to set one. The doctor took my parents word that I was acting strange and this kept me locked up longer because I was unfit for trial. Eventually the bail was set at $35,000. Something I couldn't afford and no one would help me with. So I stayed in lockup/solitary to be precise for around 2 and a half months. I ran my own business and most of my clientele dried up during this time too.
Finally the judge agreed to let me go to a halfway style home where I couldn't be during the day time and was basically a bed in a room with one roommate. I couldn't stay there during the day time so I was miserable. After a month and a half here I was permitted by the judge to go to care facility while my trial was pending. I ""GOT LUCKY"" and found a room at old ladies house with kids there and another roommate in a different room. I got a TV at least. Overpaid, but my dad was helping out since i was out of cash at this point. He paid for a couple of months 3 at the most and then my SSI kicked in. Eventually I ended up with 3 years probation unsupervised. I continued to stay at this home for another year about or 1.5 years in total before I convinced my parents to stay in the room at their house. They let me use my money for something other than rent and I paid for my storage, food and few other essentials. During this time I was able to make some traction. I am on better medication and am trying to figure out ways to earn more income by going to school. I need to get a grant or financial aid and am looking at my resources.
Now to the Point. Staying at my parents I get called names by them and they don't look into my condition nor accept that it's a debilitating disorder that thrives with support. I smoke marijuana with a medical license and they constantly yell at me for going outside to smoke since I can't indoors. There are kids in the house that they watch from my brother who has two young boys. Fair.
Well, I had feelings that something was being grown in a shed in the back yard, very corner, but it was locked and the few times I asked they said that is just had stuff that they didn't want ruined in there. I ignored it and minded my own business.
Febuary or March of last year I asked them to help me build a Bitcoin/LiteCoin mining rig so I could earn some extra money since I couldn't survive on my own with what I get. Nor can I save money according to them, I have to spend it all every month basically. Doesn't make any sense. Regardless, I thought it was a good idea because I could have installed it at my dad's office and remotely controlled the rig. He get's free power so I would be saving there. He was worried about how I would make any money and didn't have the fund to help out. No big deal I thought at the time too.
Months pass and I am told I can't smoke in the garage at night or morning anymore when it's 10 degrees out because the Grandkids they watch for free for my brother makes them sick. I go outside, to the corner and find an overhang to lean on and use this.
Now I start noticing the shed more. I spend about 200 a month on marijuana to help me and that eats up a lot of my income I get.
I discover a way inside the shed and it is a FULLY BUILT GROWHOUSE!!! (NOTE TO BE CLEAR: THIS IS MY BROTHERS he sold weed earlier in life and had people break into the home where he was living with our parents and they hit him over the head, stole his money and weed)
Bags of weed and lights, dirt, etc.
I take pictures and grab a bit of weed for myself then close up the place.
I couldn't get in the building for awhile and assumed it was what it turned out to be due to freshly run water pipe and electrical as well as the fully insulated building. I considering forcing my way in, but decided to wait. Now no one knows I know it's there and I have loads of evidence.
Here is the issue I'm having.
I feel a bit betrayed by the fact that they know I spend my little bit of money on marijuana and am constantly scolded by them for it being dangerous and bad for you. They threaten to kick me out if I use it around the kids, the normal stuff.
So obviously they know I spend my money on it and they know my brother is doing that. He pays them $0 to watch the two kids and drops them off most weekends too. He always complains about not having money and yet he and his wife got a new house, got two new cars, send their kid to preschool and pay to travel often.
I am assuming they presumed if anything happened they could just say that they are growing for me since I have a prescription. But he doesn't smoke it so the only thing to do is to sell or give to me. There is too much for just me so it's being sold.
This is far too long already and I'm ending it with a question. I'll edit the story with more detail and anecdotes if anyone cares.
My question is that considering I was not supported nor helped when needed and instead got ratted on for nothing really since it was in my head. Do you think I should say anything to anyone?
Maybe if they worked with me and helped me when I asked about getting help on a mining rig more than once with a plan to get the money back I would be turned down. Reminder this was when the coins were worth $30 or something.
If I say something I will get kicked out of the place I live and can't afford better. I am hoping to build myself up and get repaired so I can work with others properly.
I'm leaning towards MYOB and getting free weed, but I can see that not lasting. I just feel like I'm being marginalized when I'm the one who needs some support.
Thanks for reading.
tl;dr I am sent to jail for psychic break and made fun of for it, not treated as problem, the same parents help my brother use their yard for a shed to grow weed to sell. I am left buying my own weed while disabled with no help taking most of my income. Refuse to help me when asked.

I posted this earlier in r/offmychest and I don't think anyone looked. Could you upvote that one if you think this is interesting. Maybe I can get opinions of people not so supportive. Thanks.

My grandma drives my aunt around to do errands at least twice a week and also makes sure she is taking her medication regularly. 

Recently, my aunt was evicted from her apartment because she kept making threats that she was going to leave so the apartment management decided they had had enough. My grandma has been trying to help her find a new place but in the meantime, my aunt has been staying in homeless shelters. She can't stay with my grandma because  my grandma doesn't feel safe having her in the house (something happened a while back... I don't know the details). 

This is a lot of work for my grandma and she's already strapped for money so she can only help so much. Furthermore, my grandma isn't going to live forever. 

To be honest, I don't know much about schizophrenia, so I don't know how independent one can be. Part of me wonders if my aunt is taking advantage of my grandma, and how much my grandma is enabling her. My aunt can take public transportation to get her medicine, go to the doctor, to buy and return things from the store, and to go to the food bank, but she relies on my grandma to drive her around. I'm sure my grandma does it because she wants to make sure her daughter is taking care of herself, but there are ways for her to get around without my grandma. My aunt refuses to take the city's public transportation because it is called ""The Wizard"" and she is extremely religious.

Anyway, to the point, I'm wondering if there is some sort of government assistance that provides a caretaker to do what my grandmother is doing that might be covered or subsidized by the government. 
Also, I read somewhere that sometimes family members who take care of loved ones who aren't well can sometimes get paid by the government to do this. Does this apply to family members with schizophrenia, or is it for aging family members?

We grew up with her going through episodes, and going berserk.  So much and so frequently that I don't know how we all turned out pretty normal.

I cringe when my mom starts to act up in front of my very young nephews.  I wouldn't want my own future children to witness anything like it, or hear anything like the things she says.  I will do what I can to make sure she doesn't get my girlfriend's phone number, because she texts very rude and crazy things, things nobody should ever say to or about another human being.  She says terrible things about my dad, about my siblings, about me and to me.

I've always told myself that it's her illness, and that's why she says these things, and that if she wasn't mentally ill, she wouldn't be saying these things.  But the thought keeps creeping up that I think she has control over some of these things, that she knows what she's doing.

I don't know what to do.  My parents still live together, but pretty much hate each other.  My dad is getting pretty old, and his health isn't great.  It's getting to the point where I am getting nervous for him.  All it would take is for my mom to give him a push in a heated argument, or just flat out do nothing if he has a heart attack.  If my dad were to have a serious health incident, it wouldn't surprise me if I found out after the fact that my mom would refuse to help him, or even heckle him while it happens.

The thing is that there definitely are times where she seems like a completely normal person.  She's funny, she can be super nice, and she'll say nice things to me and about me.  She'll text me out of the blue to say she's proud of me.

I don't know what to do about my mom.  I don't know how to help her.  I don't know how to tell if she says these things because she is ill, or if she says them because she is a terrible person.  It breaks my heart.

What I have learned is that you can't win in an argument against her.  If she tells me the sky is green, I just need to let her roll with it.  I've also learned that it doesn't take two to fight.  She's very capable of carrying on a fight for an hour or more without the other person saying a single word.

Honestly, I'm not sure what exactly it is I'm asking, but any advice or insight that I can get in this whole situation, and about my mom, would be much appreciated.  I just want to help my mom, and even after 25 years, I still don't quite get what goes on through her head during these episodes.  I want to help her, I just don't know how.

quick notes: as far as I know she does have a person to talk to, and I believe she does take her medication regularly.

""they have been torturing my body for almost five years now. Militarized levels of research of my body and near unending forms of torture. Feels like they try to direct my body with video game technology? Feels similar to how the military uses video games to navigate drones? Tracking my body everywhere I go, even when I have not owned a cell phone or a computer and had minimal on-line activity. Let me say, the torture has been beyond words. Censoring things I read, lifting me high and dropping me low, and then high and low, attempting to make me go blind by squeezing my eyes together, then with electricity or some other force trying to pry them far apart so I am made vulnerable for various other things they do, I can't write more eloquently at the moment because they have done the brain suspension thing where clear thoughts don't go through, like paralysis of the brain though I can still feel all sorts of pain, moving my body around without my consent is one of the things. I would say more however I felt like I might not live to the morning, I have gone to the hospital numerous times, I thought if I were quiet they would stop monitoring me and using my body, however they did not stop and I am asking for a thorough hearing of these war crimes. I know that there are others who have undergone some of the same forms of torture and monitoring and dare I say attempts at cloning of their bodies, minds, etc... again, I tried to suffer the various losses in silence, though the tortures increased and were often done in secret without witness, to the point that I firmly believe a few murder attempts have been made beyond sheer torture. I am writing this before they either make me go blind, or hurt me in a fake accident, or fry my brain any more so it looks like a neurological disorder. They can photo copy emotional reactions you have and later try to play them on your face when you aren't feeling those emotions to try to convince you that you are feeling a particular emotion. Sometimes the radio static comes through and they give various levels of threats that I am not to say anything, or they try to steer the decisions I make in a day. I first thought they were monitoring and hurting me through my cell phone, which computer I used and a dental implant, I am now convinced after getting rid of those things and going for lengths of time using various products etc, and having them take me up and down all the time on the electricity wave things in the air, that well, what the hell is the system they are using to deny people of their humanity, not murder, it has been constant torture and research I believe so they could perfect their system so people are always directed no matter if they have devices or not. It's the unending bodily pain they have put me through when I don't ""comply"" that has lead me to write this. I am not sure how all of these words will be interpreted, I'm in a severe state of pain at the moment with the threat of possible blindness and severe threats to my loved ones if I write these things, however I am compelled to before I am either killed or damaged beyond repair.""

4 Years ago she had her first major breakdown.  Rachel had just moved to CA for school and disappeared one night.  After a few days she was found, but ""blacked out"" her memories of the experience.  All we knew was that she had been arrested for erratic driving and was released 2 days before we found her.  She claims that the cop who pulled her over pulled his gun and said he was sent by ""them"" to kill her for knowing too much, but he couldn't bring himself to do it.  Then when we found her and she was in the hospital for 3 days, she claims that the nurses tied her down and started chanting gibberish and demonic things in victory of capturing her.  Similar to the complex delusions /u/TrAway321 described.  After being released things went back to normal, and other than a few passing remarks seemed like she wasn't seeing/hearing anything disturbing.

She hadn't been on facebook in over a year after she was afraid that ""they"" were watching her.  She made this public, claiming that it was going to be her ""legacy"" so that ""everyone could know the truth"" after she was hurt.  After a week of her flipping the f*** out, my husband, FIL, and her boyfriend had an intervention to try and convince her to see a doctor.  She locked herself in her room and claimed that ""they won't let me go to a doctor"" and that there were ""forces beyond our comprehension that they won't let me explain"".  She had the dental implant removed, no change in behavior.

My in-laws immediately contacted a psychiatrist for help and showed him the facebook post.  He said that since she is not a patient of his, the only way he can get her treatment is if she voluntarily visits him or is hospitalized for another reason.  But she adamantly refuses out of fear.  She was diagnosed as bipolar after the CA episode, but the new psychiatrist and all of us are now aware that it is schizophrenia.  She refuses to take any meds, other than sleeping pills.  She won't even go to a doctor for the ""headaches"". Is the pain she described comman with schizophrenia?  She had multiple MRIs and blood analysis - no tumors, drugs, or deficiencies.

This is the second time its happened in two years. I love my uncle and he's usually a kind and gentle person. But despite being on medication he continues to hear voices and answer them and sometimes inflicts pain on himself if he thinks they are unhappy with him. Despite having had this illness for more than 25 years he has never once admitted he has a problem or accepted that his delusions are not real. He just thinks god talks so him, and that he isnt hearing voices and that nothing is wrong with him. The delusions seems to be centered around God wanting him to do things and he asks his permission and opinion for everything he does and fixates on his image. 

I think maybe the delusions are difficult to refute because he was deeply religious even before symptoms began appearing. I don't know if I can do anything to help. Is it too late for him after all this time? He has never seen a therapist and I don't believe he ever would because he doesn't think he's mentally ill and doesn't trust anyone.

I haven't left the house in five month and you think I'm going to overcome my fear to get in the pants of some bitch I've spoken too once? Yes you heard me right. I haven't been outside in five month. That was just once to go doctors. Then two month before I went dentist. So I've been out twice in seven/eight month. 

I'm scared. I have no goals. The depression is making it worse. I'm on medication but it doesn't help. I can't cope yet everyone is looking at me. Judging me not so silently. ""He's a fat lazy bastard"" ""Eww he doesn't leave the house"". I'm scared alright? How would you feel if you was the subject (victim? I don't know which is right) of abuse. It's horrible. I'm scared of sleeping because everything seems to change. I haven't had a good night sleep in years now and can't even get comfy. It's all taking its toll. The only bright side is a curse. Which the disorganized thoughts cause me to not retain information. If I watch a film, I wait two days I forget it and can always watch it again and not remember it. That's always fun. I've had enough. People try to make you feel better the first few days/weeks. Then they leave. Then you realise that once someone stops talking to you, they start talking about you. I'm not doing this for attention. If you ask me what's wrong and I tell you, I'm not doing it for attention I'm doing it because you asked, and for the rest of the people who claim they have it the second I tell them. ""I'm suffering from hallucinations"" ""Oh! I have that :D"" ""I can't remember anything"" ""Oh! Me too!"". Go fuck yourself. Last person who asked me. This is what they said. ""But it was man who created the brain scan and mental condition, how do you know you actually have anything wrong with you"" This same guy claims a multitude of mental conditions when nothing is wrong with him because for some reason. Having a mental condition is a fucking badge of honour now. Yet all that does it make light of the people who suffer from it. ",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

For first-episode patients, in case of full remission, it has been suggested that medication should be tapered or discontinued within six months to two years
(Dixon et al., 1995). For patients with multiple episodes or who show incomplete remission, there are no agreed guidelines; decisions about medication should be made on individual basis, balancing the costs and benefits of treatment.

This information is from [a report by the World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/mental_health/media/en/55.pdf) on schizophrenia. This information surprised me because it seems, from my experience, most psychiatrists say if you have schizophrenia you need to be on medication for life. There is often this comparison to insulin and diabetes to understand the need for treatment. And the World Health Organization is a very esteemed international organization, which seems to contradict that notion. Can anyone explain to me why there is this discrepancy? Has anyone been told by their psychiatrist that they can go off their medication?

So I'm a diagnosed Schizophrenic with depression, although I think anyone with schizophrenia automatically would have depression so maybe doctors are just stupid. But you see, that's part of my problem. I realize a large part of my illness has attacked my very personality. I used to be joking all the time, dreams of being on SNL, and everything. Now i'm very flat and my therapist tells me this is part of the illness but the large part that I need help with is the pure paranoia i feel all the time. I dont trust anything and delusions don't help with this. There's snipers in the college dorm next to mine always watching me through my windows, the man in the trench coat outside has a mac10 to shoot me, the government is spying on me, I'm afraid of the monsters in the dark, and I'm afraid listening devices have been implanted in my room. Take meds? Those have been poisoned too. I'm using my theater skills to remain ""normal"" and not alert any suspicion so that way i don't die. 

I fight this war every day. I'm always one-upping the opposition. I've mailed complaints telling the government I wont tell their secrets and I've even drawn battle plans to counter attack the snipers. 

So Basically, Here I am on reddit, knowing I have a problem, can't take medications (which doctors and what not LOVE to tell me to just do - their rather simple minded, non understanding people), and scared every single second. From the moment I notice a bomb on a bus going to class, to the moment I lock my door at night and sleep with the lights on. 

What do I do? I already talk it out with my therapist, and my doctor is in on the plot so i can't trust him. My medications are poisoned I absolutely can't take them, and If i try and kill myself before they kill me i'll end up in one of those damn cheesy hospitals (seriously, I hate those things). I'm pretty scared. How do I cope?

Thanks, I'm ballsy to post this because of big brother.

I'll briefly describe my story for anyone curious.  I lived a normal life pretty much with a bit of teenage depression and some more depression in college but never treated.  When I was 26 I had been having some crappy years and realized it so I went to the doctor and said I was feeling depressed anyway he gave me an antidepressant to try for a couple months.  I didn't take any of the doses immediately, I put it off for months as I wrestled with the decision of if I should take antidepressants or not but finally I did.  Well what happened next still seems so insane to me.  Everything was fine and normal but I went to bed one night and when I woke the next morning I had psychosis (I didn't know the word psychosis at the time) and hallucinations and schizophrenic voices.  I was in a whole other world.  It was the scariest thing to me, but I tried to keep it together and go to work like normal.  My work could tell I wasn't normal and sent me home until I felt better.  I was having extreme paranoia and psychosis and I pretty much just laid in bed for two weeks before my family started to get concerned.  I was having voices that kept trying to convince me to do things like take roadtrips to arizona or I would try to go to get groceries and the voices would lead me to other destinations...I had no idea what was going on.

My family finally took me and checked me in to an adult psychiatric ward where I remained for three weeks.  I was put on medication and started seeing psychiatrists.  I was in shock for most of that summer, even after I was released (with the diagnosis of 'bipolar depression' only) I continued to have voices that tried to talk to me, lead me places, etc they tried to convince me to run away and never come back and all kinds of stuff.  Also there were times where it felt like my body was physically being controlled by other entities.

Eventually through the years and moving to a different city where I have access to better treatment did I get a rediagnosis as schizoaffective bipolar.  I still get voices to this day, a lot of the time they are voices that pretend to be people I know like friends and family but sometimes it is voices of people like ex boyfriends.  The voices of my ex boyfriend in particular are abusive calling me a slut, accusing me of cheating on him, bringing up all kinds of drama from the relationship and basically make it hard to exist.

I am finally on medication that helps for the most part, and my therapist and doctor is great.  I have returned to university this past year and though I still have hard times (in October/November particularly I had insulting voices everyday and missed a lot of class and grades suffered as a result) I am still doing way better than I was 5 years ago when this all started happening out of the blue.

I know I will never be fully cured but I am trying to return to a normal life.  I want to go to the gym for fitness regularly (the voices try to keep me away, insulting me anytime I try to be physically active) and improve my social life (I've been relatively isolated except for the internet since this all started happening).  I am really trying my hardest to live a regular life.  I have even started taking on freelance clients again for work.  

Thank you for creating this community, I look forward to reading some of the other posts here and maybe learning some new information.

edited to add: the hardest part has been accepting that this is an illness and not just some kind of intelligent psychological terror attack on me personally.  by who? i can't figure that out mostly because my therapist has advised me not to bother thinking like that, but like when i get my ex boyfriends voice in my head it sure feels like he really is the one attacking me but i haven't seen or heard from him in 10+ years (he is not someone i would ever want contact with again though)",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

From pills to injections, I seem to always change from one kind of drug to the next within a year's time.

Changing medication, however, is a bit tough to deal with. My doctor usually tries to taper me off a drug slowly before I make the change which is fine. Though because I don't have a regular psychiatrist I always have to make separate appointments just to see him which can take anywhere from 2 weeks to a month.

This waiting period, since I'd be close to off my meds or completely off at this time is very stressful.

I have reoccurring nightmares whenever I sleep and I always wake up drenched in sweat. My psychotic symptoms also seem to come back which is very unsettling. I hear voices, I have involuntary movement, I have very weird vocal ticks, etc. etc.. Not to mention that the worst part is that I begin to have very bad or intrusive thoughts.

Telling my doctor about these symptoms only gets a response with, ""You're gonna have to wait until you see your psychiatrist"" and leaves it at that. I once had to admit myself to ER because it got very bad - although doing this made the transition from my meds even longer.

I'm currently off one of my meds and I'm changing to a different one once I see a psychiatrist which is happening next week.

I'm not sure if this would be the right place to ask or even talk about this sort of thing, but I'm curious what I can do to quell these symptoms, especially my nightmares since I get very little sleep every night because of them.

On my part I've been the one that has tried to fix things more, while she seemed to be less interested in the relationship.



Soon i found out that she had been diagnosed with anxiety and had been given medication that she claimed made her feel worse. After some coaxing over the weeks i told her to tell her doctor about the effects she was having, because she wasn't going to at all. 



By the time she told him, it seems that they gave her another diagnosis soon after telling her she had paranoid schizophrenia. She told me, and i could tell that she was scared and didn't really know what to do. and tbh neither did i. Its hard enough with the long distance relationship, but how can i also deal with this. i want to be there for her as best as i can, and since i cannot be there physically, there is a block on the amount of emotion i can express, and words aren't always enough. I'm confused as what to do. I'm in love with her and she wants what we have to continue, but she is scared that i will leave her and she is even more scared about what will happen to her.

UPDATE: I've had some time to think about all the comments you guys have posted. After talking it over with her, we have agreed to stay together. I'm still in love with her, and she told me, "" I still love you. And i still want you in my life."" She went along to say that she doesn't want this to be one-sided and she wishes she could do the same things that i do for her. 

I know I'll probably be in for hell, and the relationship still has a great potential of ending up horribly. But I still want to give this a chance. 

I also think it would be a bad time to break up, since she feels like she has become a burden on her family. To her right now, everyone seems to have left her. I cannot simply walk away when she needs to feel as secure as she possibly can. I cannot imagine what she is going through, but I'm going to try my best. I'm taking steps so I can see her as soon, and be there as best as I can be, because this is more than just about our relationship. This is her life, and she needs support. 

I was lucky enough to get a job at the university through a contact. I'm planning on saving enough to go on a trip and see her during my break.

They can read all the textbooks they want, but some of them will **never** fully understand. Despite what people have told me in the past, I've found more and more that it's a good idea to isolate myself from everybody in my life, except for my fiance. 

There's always those careless/ignorant comments somebody will make, and they don't realize the negative impact they make on me. I don't know if they just don't know better, are emotionally inept, or what. But I'm truly sick of getting bullshit from people, whenever I do what's suggested of me, and try to 'be honest' and 'socialize'.

But he made a comment that made me fucking snap just now. And again, weather it's intentional or not, it doesn't matter to me. I'm so fucking pissed off. I want to scream at him, or punch him  in the face-OR SOMETHING.

...You have to be shitting me, you have to be fucking shitting me. Do people really think like this? Because if so, they're the real messed up ones, not me.

This is one of the only things I don't blame myself for in my life. And I don't blame others either. That's one of the things I know I'll never fully understand or relate to somebody about. We all may have the same disease, but that doesn't mean it's the same for everybody.

I didn't want this, choose this, bestow it on myself, pursue it, induce it: **none** of that. I was born and it just fucking happened. Looking back, I've been showing symptoms my whole life. And I thought I had my anger outbursts under control, or that I'd finally outgrown them, but apparently not. (I can at least hope can't I.)

No matter how nice I'd like to be, at least I have the fucking balls to admit that I judge to some extent, and that I'm not a completely empathetic person, and that I don't know everything about everything. Fucking goddammit, seriously. I've sat people down and tried to explain from a first hand perspective. To friends, family, curious strangers alike, I've really fucking tried. I've tried to be patient, slow to anger or taking things personally, but most of all I've tried to be **honest**. I feel that this disease won't lose any of it's stigma and get the attention it really needs, if everybody is sugar coating it and going by pure textbook information and disinformation alone. And little bullshit comments like that don't make me wanna try for any cause, at all anymore. 

I actually want to help people, ill or not. I've experienced, and go through some pretty bad stuff. I'd like to use those experiences to motivate, and help others that have it worse off than me, or just feel hopeless or alone. It's not just being 'crazy'. It's also depression, feeling suicidal, worthless, like a failure, like it's your fault, like there isn't any way anything is going to get better, like you're doomed to be trapped by yourself for your whole life, plus more. It's **not** a matter of, 'i think I'm going to act batshit crazy in the morning, and make everybody hate and judge me'. And hey, you know what? Maybe some people DO actually do drugs to self medicate. I know I did/do. No, that didn't cause all this, but I'm not denying I've ever done it. I've been forcibly sedated, abused, and using since I was about twelve. To this day I haven't gotten any real help in my whole fucking life. I'm currently trying to change that, but believe it or not it's not a matter of snapping your fingers, popping a pill, or plopping me into a shrink's chair or in a ward; and it gets better. I'm so sick of people saying, 'well go see a/your psychiatrist for help', like I didn't know that already or try to do that before. IF I EVEN HAD ONE. You can have all the meds and psychologists your life can hold. But you'll never be truly happy or at ease if you're all alone in your world. Because let's face it, we all live in our own in-between universes. Everybody needs somebody, no matter how much they say/think they don't. We weren't made to be alone, even though we're forced to be, a lot of the time. That goes for me too. My worst fear even above death, is that I'll wind up alone at some point. Which is why I cling to my fiance so tightly. I feel like he's the only one that will fully ever understand me, because he has schizophrenia too. Only he's perfect, he's the opposite of what I am. But I can't imagine the thought of even existing if he were to ever be gone at some point. But most of the time, I'd like to just run away with him and just drown the rest of the world out. Just say 'fuck it' and not care about anybody else or even acknowledge them. And it's for reasons like this. Maybe it's my state of mind, maybe it's my lack of pride or self respect. But either way;

Fuck you, ____. Fuck you. You'll **NEVER** know what any of this is truly like, and you're an honest to god idiot. I don't know weather to cry, scream, punch you in the face, or just ignore you after this. I don't care about the intent of your statement. The damage is done and I'm not going to pretend that it's alright. You, and the rest of this fucking world are always telling me how wrong I am, how at fault and horrible and stupid I am. You know what? Maybe you're fucking stupid and wrong too. You're the reason people like us keep to ourselves and get treated like stereotypes from movies. People like you make want to fucking give up on the world, and on life. What's the fucking point of anything if everybody is like this? If that's all the world has to offer than no thank you. Keep your fucking bullshit and fuck you for being the straw that broke the camel's back. ",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

It took me a month to recover fully and I was back on my feet. But I was put on heavy dose of Zyprexa. I gained 55 pounds, stopped going to the gym and lost all interest in anything. Then the doctors tried to switch me to Abilify and things got really bad. I started to loose all focus and had a manic episode. I got hospitalized again and was put on Risperdal. Risperdal slowed me down to the point where I just layed on my bed all day and did nothing. I couldn't take care of myself anymore. My house got filthy and it was literally painful to walk as my body felt so heavy. I had no feelings and nothing interested me anymore. Then I started to have a rash and I figured I was allergic to risperdal. I stopped taking meds by myself because my doctor was on holiday. I talked to my mom, she is a mental health nurse, and she said that it's totally up to me if I take the medication or not. And I can always go back on it if things get crazy. Her only concern was that maybe next time I get a psychotic breakdown I wont recover as well as I did before. And I'm worried about that too. If my cognitive skills get damaged and I am never able to have a good conversation with people or I can't read anymore or comprehend... Jesus Christ. I'd probably kill myself. 
But the medication made me feel so bad. I just want to live a healthy stable life filled with normal ups and downs. I want to be able to take care of my body and with my medication I couldn't even get out of bed. So far I've only experienced anxiety from the withdrawal. I've never had hallucinations or heard any voices, my psychotic breakdown was that I had very weird thoughts and delusions, books were written about me and everyone knew me, I was Jesus and I was going to die. I was sure I was dying. So it was an absolute horror. 
Should I take the chemical lobotomy or not? I'm going to talk with my doctor when she gets back. ","['dobj', 'pobj']",-1,neu_vader

I've had to stop working because of it before, and now I'm going to start working again. I get SSI so that helps and I don't really NEED to work right now, but it's a good, easy job that will give me experience in the field I am studying, so I want to do it. It was actually a job at my college that was offered to me by the head of the Multimedia department. I'm going to be a tutor in the multimedia labs starting September for the semester on and for future semesters if I choose to do that. 

It's wonderful, I'm extremely excited and I just feel so.. lucky. I feel honored that my professor/head of the department thinks I'm skilled enough in photoshop, illustrator, and dreamweaver to be a tutor for those programs. 

But there's this darkness in me that holds me back, because I know I'm still.. unwell. I'm still hearing voices, every day. I don't believe their words as much, but they're so seductive, and I can get lost in them so quickly.

For the past few years I've been hospitalized every few months without fail. Like I'll do alright for a month then the next month I'll listen to the voices telling me to slash myself and have to get stitches and get hospitalized. 

But this semester I'm going to be better, I'm aiming to not get hospitalized for the rest of the year. I worry that's too far fetched a goal. :(

I worry that my symptoms are going to get the better of me and I won't be able to help anyone while tutoring, that I'll have to call out too much and my professor won't even want me doing the job for future semesters.

Just recently I was far gone. I was thinking about hurting someone. Being dangerous. Not homicidal or anything, but threatening, crazy, psychotic stuff. I was on the verge of being one of those dangerous schizophrenics that give us all a bad name. 

I got out of it with a bit of time and thinking, thankfully, but I just feel out of it now. I worry a lot about my future. Am I doomed to be in mental hospitals forever? To never find love and have a family? To always have to have people taking care of me because I'm too sick to take care of myself? 

Right now I'm in a sober living, for my schizophrenia, and I'm doing well, I'm independent. It's wonderful. But I'm so afraid. I feel like my grip on reality and my sanity is so incredibly fragile and that I can switch from being rational to irrational and fall into my delusional thoughts so quickly. It doesn't feel like it's in my control. This disease is bigger than me and I'm just.. standing in its shadow. Waiting for it to strike me, to contain me, to consume my identity and then.. and then I'll lose myself again. I'll be consumed with thoughts of other dimensions, realities, question the existence of the desk right in front of me, question the intentions of my closest friends and family.. 

How do you stay positive about your future and keeping your goals with this illness? I know it's supposed to get better with age(I'm 22), but I just worry it will get worse.

I feel somewhat suicidal. I don't know.. I feel like backing out of life. I was supposed to go in Friday for another injection of my medication(Abilify), but I rescheduled for Monday, and I rescheduled again today for Wednesday.. so that's going to be 5 days without medication.. and I was already symptomatic. I don't think it'll really do anything. I guess I shouldn't really worry.

I'm a hebephrenic (disorganized) schizophrenic.

So a month ago I lost my antipsychotics - the same day I had a refill. So I decided to punish myself for that and just try to survive a month without meds. Dumb idea.

So now I don't care about personal hygiene, eating, sleeping and work anymore. I know I'll probably be fired (or already am) but that doesn't bother me. I just want to disappear, be erased. However I dread dying in the cold.

Also I'm kind of screwing over my employer. I missed 2 deadlines more than a week ago and they're still trying to contact me. What the hell do I tell them? ""Sorry, I was a dumbass and lost my meds and for that I've caused you financial loss?""

At first I wanted to go to the USA, but as i grew older I realised that it was nearly impossible unless you have money to continue your eduction, or get incredible grades. So after I graduated from university I put my hopes on immigrating to Canada through the point system as a skilled worker.

Once I was diagnosed with schizophrenia I came to a realisation: Canada has a medical admissibility test. There was a chance that I would be rejected because I had schizophrenia. There was a chance that I get accepted because I work full time as a software engineer and I don't have symptoms when medicated, but that was not for sure. 

Canada's medical inadmissibility is for  people who might pose a danger on the health and safely of themselves or the wider population. 

So anyway, about 6 years ago when I saw my latest psychiatrist he told me that after five years I could stop taking my meds. So I decided to postpone my immigration application to Canada. I thought that when I would stop taking my meds, I wouldn't tell the canadia immigration officers about it.

Well what ended up happening is that 5 years later (at the start of this year), I had a psychotic episode because I had stopped my meds.

Now I am back on meds. I had applied for immigration 2 years ago, and now i am waiting for a reply from Canada for my immigration. I am going to have to tell them that I suffer from schizophrenia.

My shrink is reluctant to give me a paper on my health, but he said that he will do it. I think sometimes in the next few months I will be contacted.

I think that if I applied years ago and got rejected, I would have known where I stand and would have made different decisions since then. I had the chance 4 years ago to leave to another country, but i decided against it.


I look at my life these days and see that this issue of immigration is the biggest issue that got affected by my illness. And it is a big issue. Lebanon is not a good country. Someone like me who works in software doesn't earn as much as he would if he lived in the west, and is not as successful. Also this country doesn't provide as much opportunity to be independent. Housing is very expense which is why most unmarried people like myself live with their parents.

My brother has been to several different behavioral hospitals included one I've been too multiple times for my bipolar. The staff there were great to me. One of his biggest issues right now is that he thinks everybody is out to get him. He thinks doctors and the ""mental health system"" is a conspiracy against him which has put a chip in his head that reads his thoughts and can explode anytime. Staff he refers to by name which I was even under the care he claims are against him and say and do things that are negative towards him. He is scared that he is going to die by all these people that want him dead. He thinks me step brother (a drug dealer) is part of a government conspiracy to control gangs and they want him ""messed with"" and ""killed"". He has ran away from home and hid the key thinking he was in great danger and didn't want them coming after us. Whenever he leaves the house he thinks he is being followed and every person he meets ""says things that are inside my head"" which he refuses to believe are caused by his schizophrenia. He thinks they have some technology that is doing this and it gets him so spaced out that he claims to feel physical pain ""poking my brain"" ect that he tells me are the people trying to torture him and kill him. I could go on and on. He hears sirens, ambulances, and sometimes the ""neighbors speak to me while I am trying to sleep"". Even though he denied seeing hallucinations the other day I tried so hard to talk sense into him that he admitted that one day when he was being followed he was able to move his hand through the people as if they weren't real.

Sorry for the ramble, I just don't know how to help him anymore. To the best of my knowledge he was taking his medication steady for at least a month, maybe two. I think the medication helped with the auditory hallucinations but he was beyond paranoid still. Several occasions he stops taking his medication and he will sit there for hours smoking cigarettes left and right constantly putting his hand through his hair and is still just as paranoid as when he was on medication, just  isn't so visibly to me effected by it.

It is to the point now where I beg him to take his medication and he yells at me saying the medication isn't going to help him. I try to explain to him that medication can take a very long time to get adjusted in the system, maybe even a year(not sure if true, but for my bipolar medications I've been told this before so I'm just trying to help)

He is really bad at communicating what he is experiencing one because its so unbelievable and second he claims sometimes if he explains exactly whats happening to him he will die.

I've had family members sit in with him with doctors and do their best to make sure as much information was given to the doctors so they could treat him well. I think the most they did medication wise for him in the last few months was up the dosage by a little bit and say ""he needs to be on it longer""

Now how the heck can I help? My dad is going to have another stroke with all the stress this is giving him and we both can't seem to communicate any sense into him. I know that probably is a bad approach because every belief he has he has an excuse for any logic behind why it is not real.


He is always freaking out that he is going to be sent to a hospital the rest of his life because ""thats what they want to happen to torture me"" I just feel really sad for him. It makes me so angry that I am powerless and can't do a damn thing.","['dobj', 'pobj']",-1,neu_vader

I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia about less than a year ago but I've experienced delusions a ton throughout my life. I also see shadows kill other shadows in the dark and sometimes when I watch 'Family Guy' Stewie enjoys using my name instead of Brians. A large part of my illness is delusions however; my medications are poisoned, snipers are trying to kill me, the government has a plot to kill me... stuff like that. I am currently afraid to take medications so I rely heavily on coping skills to get me through day to day activities. Obviously the best way to deal with all that is listed below is to remain on medication and talk to a doctor but sometimes you need to mix both. Here's some things I do: 

Here's some things I use to cope with delusions: 

1. I find what makes me comfortable and use it all the time, by this I mean, I enjoy my blinds closed in my college dorm so nothing can see me, and paper over my lights so when I go to sleep at night the lights are dimmed enough to help me sleep.

2. Making sure I'm not so scared that I isolate. Isolation leads to going back to that damn hospital that feeds you like an animal and makes you attend seminars on ""communication"". Instead of going there, I call up a good friend or family member, maybe play online with them on a video game, or talk to them on the phone. Sometimes when I'm scared but not too scared I'll invite them over, or go to their house. 

3. Talk about it with yourself or therapist. Communicate the rational of a situation. For example, I once thought one of my close friends wasn't real because no one really talked about him. I communicated with a friend, ""Man that Jordan guy, he's funny"" (this allowed me an out because I could say I saw some person on TV named Jordan. But they filled in the last name and stuff of Jordan. 

4. Understanding It's not real. This is the hardest thing to do. With a delusion we feel the truth in this throughout our whole body. It makes us better to believe in it because if we don't our life and the whole worlds life is at risk. This can cause massive stress and time commitment, challenge yourself to think of other options.

5. Distract yourself. This is a massive one i use. I YouTube, play video-games  read books, study, listen to music, clean my room, organize my room, and even shop online to use free time that could become scared time. Pick up a new hobby, discover a new website (a great one to check out is ""patientslikeme.com), or even try a new food. Anything to get your mind off of sending messages to the government to remove listening devices. 

Here's some things I use to cope with Visual Hallucinations: 

1. Sometimes It's okay to believe it's real. If there is a Hallucination that you think may be fake, but Is not threatening you in any way, then so what. We didn't choose to have this illness but by god we can choose what Hallucinations bother us. 

2. Distract and return. If you see a sniper scope glistening from the fourth floor the building next to you, try watching and episode of a TV show, or movie even. Then return to the situation, or decide not to. Some of the time I'll return to the situation and realize it was just a weird way the sun was bouncing off a window. This prevents me from getting paranoid. 

3. Ignore. This can be really hard when delusions tie into it but sometimes it's possible to walk past and ignore everything around you. If your not sure if it's real or fake then try putting in ear phones when walking so when you walk past someone they'll think that you can't hear them.

Here's some things I use to cope with Paranoia:

1. Distracting. I've said it before but if you can find a hobby that takes up time till the episode is over - take that rout. 

2. Don't set yourself up. When i first started having paranoid episodes I noticed I would hurry up and call someone like my mom. This built up extreme suspense because what if my mom didn't pick up? What if the phone call ended up short? I felt like since I was banking on one phone call they would shoot me right afterwards. I learned that this was not helping so now I only call people when I'm okay, or when there is warning signs that an episode may occur. 

3. Knowing your Paranoia. Does it occur when your outside? Inside? Elevator? Bus? These are all things you can avoid to not even put yourself in that situation. 

4. Taking every single opportunity to enjoy life. Paranoia for me pushed me to want to kill myself to not give ""the government"" satisfaction. Every time since that hospitalization I've listed when I felt happy and why. I listened to a great Beatles song, I love key-lime pie, learned a new song on the guitar, got an A on my test. When i feel like dying I now look at this list and it helps immensely (for me) because when I got depressed and scared I felt like life wasn't worth it but when I see that key-lime pie is out there, well.. Just trust the power of the key-lime pie.

Overall: 

I must apologize for not supplying coping skills for audio or tactile Hallucinations. I don't have these as often but when I do I just blame my body and not my brain. For example, feeling a deep itch is a lack of something from bananas causing my muscles to do blah blah blah. This helps me not stress out over the less frequent Hallucinations and focus just on life. With that said - ENJOY LIFE, it may suck so much sometimes, and no one understands it. The stigma for our illness is so bad I've stayed up late crying because one of my friends said ""Kyle you're crazy"" -in reference to a video game or action not my illness. If you can get a great support system under you belt, great therapist, trust medication, and have a routine and a team to help you then this will help develop your own personal coping skills for any problem. 

I hope this helped someone out there, feel free to comment below any things you guys (said to include both genders, Is this wrong?) do to cope with psychosis.

I haven't felt sad in a very long time. I'm on meds but still I don't feel anything. I see death and I feel no grief like at funerals I don't feel anything while looking at my dead grandmother. I'm not desensitized because I have never felt like I see other people feel. Like 2 weeks ago I saw my dog get hit by a car and I didn't feel anything. Does anyone else feel this way? Also what should I do about my girlfriend I don't feel love for her anymore but she has done nothing to make me not love her. ",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

So basically, I'm a film student and I would like to make a low budget film about mental health issues. I've done research, but I feel like that can only go so far. I would like real life answers from people so I can create realistic characters. So if you could give me any insight, I would really appreciate it, otherwise I have some questions: 

1. What is the most challenging part about being schizophrenic?
2. What are your symptoms?
3. What are some common misconceptions (perhaps some that you've seen in movies) that really irritate you?
4. Do you take medication? What is that like?
5. Is there something that others might find surprising, or maybe even good, about being schizophrenic?

I was so excited, because I've wanted to work in a grocery store like this for such a long time. I loved my first 3 days there (with the exception of everyone talking badly about everyone else) when I had help, but once no one was helping me anymore, I just started to stress to the point of not being able to do anything really and just wanting to curl up on the floor. The lines were never ending and I couldn't go fast enough both checking out and bagging to catch up. If there did come a point where there was no line they would have you do other hurried task. Even the breaks were stressful only being allowed 10 minutes to get your drink, go to the back room, eat, use the restroom, and then get back on the floor. On top of the stress, I kept forgetting to take my medicine (Geodone,) because my alarm would go off while I was working, so this day I took it early. Bad idea. I was so exhausted that just cleaning up at night seemed like the hardest thing in the world. I quit the next day after coming home, freaking out, then taking stress-relief medicine that I hadn't taken in months. I feel very ashamed that I wasn't able to hold that job that I wanted to badly and now I can't find work and worry that if I do find something it's going to happen again. I know that stress is a bad trigger for my mental illness. I went to a NAMI group and everyone is telling me that I need to apply for disability, but I really don't think I'm bad enough for that and I want to be able to be proud of myself, by being able to support myself and my fiance. 

**My question is, what do some of you do for a living that have problems with stress? Any suggestions for careers for someone who doesn't have very much education?** I've thought about pet sitting since I've done that before. I'd really like to work at a vet's office, but every time I apply I'm rejected even though I have kennel and pet experience.

So I just found out last week that one of my closest friends was diagnosed a few months back, and I have no idea what to do. 

For some backstory:

So last year he became very very sick, hospitalised a few times and the end result was pretty bad damage to his spleen and liver, at times they were thinking cancer but decided to just monitor it. It was massively stressful for him. Since then we started randomly having fights. Big fights. They would start out of the blue over nothing and quickly blow up (in a matter of an hour) into some big thing where we wouldn't talk for weeks. Then it would be all over just as quick as they started, we would be having goes at each other then suddenly were best friends again. I knew something was wrong. I have anxiety issues so I thought it was me so I started seeing some psych's. I tried to get him to see some one too, but at the last minute he would change his mind and say ""no I just need to work through it myself."" Around this time he kept coming up with crazy plans to move across the country, or even world, with no plan to support himself, other than ""I will find a way to manage"" - if I tried to talk it through with him it would often cause a huge fight. I put it all down to the stress from being sick and him not knowing how to cope and trying to get away from it. 

Things were good for a couple of months, we had never been closer, he had decided he wanted to stay at home for a few more years until he had completed some more studies, landed a job, gotten his licence etc. We had just talked about it all, when a couple days later he came to me very distressed saying ""My sister is moving back in. I wont be able to take it. She and my mum will fight and I will probably kill one of them. I'm moving out with this guy I met a few months ago on the other side of the city."" I figured this was one of his moods again, and he had always planned to move in and be house mates with me when he was ready. I tried to talk to him, it turned into this MASSIVE fight. Unlike anything we had ever had before, at some point he was calling the police / threatening to take restraining orders out on me even though I wasn't threatening him or being violent. I tried to support him and offered to help him move his stuff if he wanted to move in with this guy, it was clear his mind was made up and there was no way I was changing it so I may as well try and be there for him. It was around this time I started seeing the psych's a lot more, and they all told me these fights didn't seem my fault and it sounded like he had problems. These fights were massively damaging to me on a mental level. I was in a very dark place because of them, I didn't understand why we were fighting, or why he was doing some pretty unforgivable stuff to attack me. Eventually (all this happened over the space of about 2-3weeks mind you) he told me I was too much effort and he wanted nothing to do with me any more and cut off all contact with me. I was hearing through friends he was in a very bad state. It sounded like he was having similar fights with his parents (and he is very very big on family). During all this he just didn't seem like himself, and I even told him that a couple times when we were fighting. 

So that was it for about 2-3 months. Then last week by chance he got in contact again through Facebook. I asked him what had happened, because something was obviously wrong, and I had heard some things, and he finally came clean and told me that a couple months ago he had been diagnosed as having schizophrenia. He said he had started having delusions 6 months ago that his family and those closest to him were trying to kill him, he was hearing voices telling him he needed to kill them before they got to him, and having visual hallucinations of people chasing him. The tipping point seemed to be when he was working on a roof, he said he saw people chasing after him and jumped off the roof, having a seizure when he landed. He also told me a few weeks ago he tried to overdose on sleeping tablets. 

This is just so much for me to process. He didn't want to talk much about the last 6 months since its too painful for him, and said he's on pretty strong meds at the moment so most of the time he's a zombie. That night he told me we talked for 4 hours and it really felt like he was my old friend again. Since then I've tried talking to him a few times and he's just seemed really distant again. 

So I've been spending the last week going over everything in my head, trying to make sense of it all and what it means. He hurt me a lot, and I promised myself, my other close friends and my family I would never have anything to do with him again after everything he had done to me. But this changes everything. And as I've been thinking through everything that happened I've been making connections, and I think that our fights were being fuelled by the onset of his condition. I think I have finally come to the conclusion that I should try and be there for him and support him through this, normally this is the sort of thing me and him would talk through, I have talked through with my other friends and they have started to come around to the position that maybe it would be it would be OK if I was there for him, at first they were all telling me to tell him to go away. 

So now the question is, I have no idea what to do, or what he is actually going through (it's obviously hard to talk to him at the moment to find out from him). I have no idea how to best be supportive for him, or what I should be careful of doing so he doesn't have another episode. I have no idea what to expect going forward, I could really do with some advice and pointers, and since I'm on reddit so much I figured this sub would be a good start. I have been doing a lot of my own research on Wikipedia and such, but it's just so clinical and generic, I'm not sure how to apply it to this situation. 

Sorry for the long post. I suppose I just needed to get a lot of my thoughts down on paper.

So I am curious why some people get diagnosed with Paranoid Schizophrenia because I thought everyone with schizophrenia suffered from paranoia to various degrees.

I knew a woman that had schizophrenia but I only recently learned there is different types of it. In her case she heard loud voices in her head, usually around the evening and was on heavy medication. She also had delusions that she had given birth to a son a long time ago and had been married, and that her son was taken away from her by social services. I knew this was not real or true because the people taking care of her had been since she was 9 and they were also my care givers at the time, so I inquired about it. She told me she would send mail and recieve mail from her husband. I never saw her freak out, but she had a strange habit of rubbing her hands together when excited like a child, and if she was in a time of regular suffering she would look incredibly sick out of nowhere and would lock herself in her room and play loud music via her headphones. Her excited/bubbly/happy personality would completely vanish and she would be overwhelmed in a darkness of mental/emotional seclusion. She told me her voices would tell her our care givers were evil and constantly lying to her, and that she should not trust them. Would this be paranoid schizophrenia?",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

Long story short, I got a little annoyed with a friend who didn't know (what I thought) was basic knowledge about type I diabetes. Friend said not everyone knows everything about every disease, I said people should have a basic understanding of common ailment etc. Later I was driving home and was mildly self reflecting on my own knowledge on disease, specifically mental ones. Came to the conclusion other than the movies, I have a non existent understanding of how schizophrenia affects a person. So if you'll be patient with me, can someone clear up some misconceptions and give ELI5 examples and answers? The interwebs has loads of information I'm reading and watching videos about, but a real personal response would be more informative. If I am being too intrusive or personal, let me know. 

1. Symptoms are on a spectrum. If I read some books correctly, like most disease, it differs person to person. Some have auditory hallucinations, or manic/depressant emotions, amongst other positive and negative symptoms. Can someone explain what a case of ""mild"" schizophrenia differ from someone on the more ""severe"" side of the spectrum? Sever meaning frequent occurrences of delusions of some type. 

2. Medication. Mental disease medication is tailored like most others. My insulin formula is much different than my other T1 diabetic, but we both are health individuals. What type of medication is usually prescribed, and does it have negative side effects? I understand those with depression can have low libidos, increased apathy, and weight gain. Not all, but those are the common I'm aware of. I'm not trying to be invasive, I am just curious.

3. Those with family members with the disease, is it blatantly obvious if a loved one is not medicated/ not even aware they have the disease. Most of my colleagues and co workers don't know I'm diabetic, because it's not a physical or mentally imposing disease. If my friend does not take his ADHD medication, it's very obvious. When he does, I would've never guessed he had it. I'm assuming it varies person to person, I'm just looking for a baseline understanding of social relations.

4. What do you think is the biggest thing the general population misunderstands about schizophrenia? Medial portrayals of most things are hardly accurate, I can't imagine trying to use mental illness to make a character interesting purely by psychological disturbances people looked up online. In short, whats the basic understanding people should have about someone diagnosed with schizophrenia?

I also want you to know that I'm sorry for asking and talking about my stupid problems here.

I just need some insight to my situation.

A few months back, I was diagnosed with OCD and panic disorder. My problem is that I keep obsessing over whether or not I'm schizophrenic. I don't hear voices and I don't have delusions (that I know of). The closest that I've gotten to a ""delusion"" is being terrified that someone is going to poison or drug my food/drink or that someone is going to break into my apartment and kill me.

Within the last week, I've had severe depersonalization. Sometimes I wake up and I don't feel real. It just seems like i'm watching everything around me happen and that I'm on autopilot. It's so hard to describe. This is what has kicked in my obsessions and my compulsions over schizophrenia. I research it over and over and I come here almost every day to people's posts about how their disease manifested. I'm 24 so I can't rule out that I'm not. The doctor I went to didn't think I was schizophrenic but how could she know? I only saw her once. I don't take medication, which I should, but medication scares me too. I'm terrified of taking medication because I don't want it to ""change me."" And this isn't even with antidepressants or anxiolytics. It's with practically everything. I get nervous if I have to take Tylenol. 

I'm getting extremely depressed because I can't control my thoughts over this and it seems that I'm constantly looking for reasons as to why I could be schizophrenic. I ask my boyfriend every day if I seem different or if my personality has changed. I'm so FUCKING tired of this. I'm exhausted. I wake up every morning with my stomach in knots and I have severe pangs of anxiety throughout the day. I'm irritable, I'm angry, I'm fucking impatient. I thought that I could beat this shit on my own but I'm thinking that I need to see a fucking doctor before I lose my goddamn mind. 

I guess this all stems from having control issues. I'm terrified of something happening to me that will ruin my life or my future. I'm afraid that I'll lose control of my life and not be able to find my way back. I'm afraid of losing my job, my boyfriend, my apartment, I'm afraid that something bad is going to happen and my life is going to be ruined forever. I keep telling myself that if I develop psychosis that I'll be put into a hospital and get a few weeks off work and take some medicine to chill me out and that it won't be that bad. But I know it will be. So, is it really that bad? Is this something that I should absolutely fear and let take over my life?

Again, I know that you all have problems of your own and I'm sorry but I have no where else to turn. Everyone else is getting sick of my stupid questions and dumb reality checks.

I am a fellow schizophrenic, diagnosed in 2012. 1 week away from my 21st bday, I have aspirations of becoming a model, but what's keeping me is a few acne pimples on my face that I can't seem to get off.

I get paranoid in public, I hate the medication, have tried Risperdal, Abilify, (which made me very very sleepy) and seroquel, which just sedated me to no other. Before my diagnosis and as a young child I was full of life.

Smoked pot since I was about 18, which led to my psychosis, or must have been the spark, because my family is in agreement that I do have  mental illness. I live on government assistance getting 1100 dollars a month. Suicidal thoughts daily. Thinking really hard about relapsing into the pot, but I know that will just make things worse.

Feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. I feel like nothing in life truly matters. We're born and we die. We don't take anything with us, so why should I try to make money? Why not just be high all day and forget about everything? Or be drunk? 
The paranoia and suicidal thoughts have become a part of my day to day life, and I can handle it, but I have a feeling one day I'll just fucking snap. I wouldn't even mind being psychotic, I would actually love it, just to escape from this fucking bleak reality...

I feel like all that we've been through with the hallucinations and paranoia and delusions, everything that goes along with schizophrenia, should be worth something. We've survived things that are truly from a horror movie, and yet, there's such a stigma attached to schizophrenia that we really can't tell anybody. 

Personally, I feel like I've achieved a lot. A LOT. My schizophrenia started when I was nine. I didn't get proper treatment until well after I turned eighteen. By then I was getting ready to graduate with 2 honors diplomas, a nurse's aide license with the State Board of Nursing, and had gotten into a prestigious nursing school. I feel like I really made something of myself, despite this....umm..setback? I guess? I dunno. It's not like I can tell my employers what my greatest achievement is (getting through the schizophrenia to be who I am today). They'd never hire me. Who wants a schizophrenic nurse working for them? Even if they are completely stable and basically symptom free on medication.

I have been reading about the symptoms of onset schizophrenia and believe I may be experiencing them. I have a hard time falling asleep on certain nights, and during these times, my head is simply awash with various random thoughts. There are periods of time when I find myself taking a longer-than-usual amount of time to understand what someone is saying or something that I am reading. I have been having a series of paranoid thoughts about conspiracy theories as well, but I do not give these thoughts any merit as they are not grounded in logic.


I become very anxious about the idea of possibly having schizophrenia, especially after finding out that an earlier appearance of symptoms may indicate a worse prognosis. (I am an 18 year old male, so this is especially early.) I am conscious of the possibility that I may be developing schizophrenia, which I find odd, as I have read from multiple sources that those with schizophrenia are usually in denial of their mental condition. I'm very scared of reaching a point where the conclusions I make in my day-to-day life are no longer grounded in logic, and I'm even more scared of reaching a point where I begin to act on those conclusions.


Here's some background about my health (if any of it is of relevance)
-I have, for some reason, an alarmingly high heart rate
-I haven't been getting much sleep since the seventh grade (so approximately the last 6 years)
-I was diagnosed with depression in high school
-My uncle (mother's brother) appears to have schizophrenia (even though it's undiagnosed)


So I have a lot of questions and I'm hoping for some kind soul to answer them for me.
1) What can I do right now to avoid the possibility of experiencing a psychotic break (if it is at all possible to stop?)
2) If I do get to the point where I develop schizophrenia and have to take antipsychotic medication, is there any way for me to continue my studies as an engineer, and to then go on working in the industry?
3) For those who may be acquainted with mental health services at Purdue: Where should I go to address my concerns, and will the process be completely confidential?


Thanks in advanced for any help!

I was talking to him today and he told me that he is almost very certain he is, and that his mother agrees with him. In the past I and other close friends have told him we think so too.

He was telling me all about these very scary sounding hallucinations, voices in his head, sleep paralysis... it all just sounded very scary and I felt very, very sad for him. In the past he would have very strong fits of rage and say lots of crazy sounding things. Over the summer he told me that he felt like when he was mad, it was like demons were inside him telling him to do those things. He is very, very tormented by satanic imagery. Back in high school, he was very very into it and would constantly be drawing it or talking about it. Now he is terrified of the devil and that he will find him.

She hated her injections and as soon as they let her start taking her own medication in pill form she immediately stopped taking it. This was back  around October 2012. Around Christmas her parents started to notice something was up with her and of course i can't FORCE someone to take medication. At the beginning of April she was hospitalized for almost two months and I went to visit her every day, I brought her food and bought her brand new clothes that she loved, I brought her pictures of my cat because she loves him and I thought they would make her happy, I did as much as i could so she would be comfortable there.

I just finished reading a self-help book about schizophrenia by E. Torrey Fuller called ""Surviving Schizophrenia"". Some background on me, I have hebephrenic schizophrenia. I was diagnosed as prodromal in 2006 and then received a diagnosis of schizophrenia in 2011. I responded well to medication and was able to return to college after having been homeless for a couple days. 

One thing I learned from the book is that I didn't realize how many people with schizophrenia are hospitalized. I wasn't hospitalized during my psychotic period even though I could have been. I didn't express delusions or hallucinations, so it would have been very difficult to hospitalize me. I knew that I was protected by patients' rights but it hadn't occurred to me how that might have hurt me. 

I personally found many of the stories relevant to my experience. The book made me think that I'm not alone and understand my behavior in the context of my symptoms. I really liked the testimonials and stories from other people with schizophrenia.

The book is written as a manual for families with members who have schizophrenia. It gave me an opportunity to think about how my family has been affected by the course of my illness. It has a compassionate message for families and sufferers of schizophrenia.

So, overall, 10/10, would recommend. I would have liked more testimonials and first-hand accounts from sufferers of schizophrenia. Really good book and tons of further reading material for those inclined to do more research.",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

I went to the doctors office and apparently the pharmacy didn't fill out some form and didn't send the medication. The receptionist said it has to be approved by my insurance(Medi-Cal) but that they are having some changes and may not pay for it anymore. :/

It's the best medication for me. I don't feel like I'm on medication at all because it doesn't make me tired, gain weight, and I don't have to take a pill every day. It's perfect for me.

Fuck. I don't know what to do. I hate this. I'm not going through this again. I'm not going to the hospital. But these voices.. knowing they're back. It's scares the shit out of me. I can't get bad again. I can't get sick. I can't. It's a nightmare and I thought I was finally at peace. I heard voices too last week for a day, but the next day I was fine. Other than that all month that I've been on Abilify I've been doing amazing. My mind's been at ease. No worries, no voices telling me to off myself. 

Things got really bad with the voices. It was horrible. I climbed to the top level of the parking structure at my college, slit my wrist frighteningly deep, and nearly jumped off before someone from another side pulled me to safety. All because I was hearing voices constantly. All because I was sick with delusions and paranoid and I was a mess. I don't want to do that ever again. I don't want to ever be that sick. 

I don't know what to do. My doctor's office said they'd call me when they know more.

Meanwhile I'm sitting in my house, hearing whisper whisper whisper of ""Come here. Come save us. You have to kill yourself. Can you Hear Us? Kill yourself"" How could it get this bad so quick? I mean I started hearing voices earlier today and then I looked up the half life of the shot and I realized that I probably should have gotten the shot sooner. 

I hate these voices. I hate them. They're not apart of me, they're not important like I thought before. They don't have a message that will heal me from the damage my life has done to me. And I'm not their God or a savior or anything. They're not apart of me and I want them gone. I want to be me. Not this fucked up disease that keeps trying to take over my life.

I have to have the room lite up like its daylight to laydown. I feel like everything i have been through has been set up for me, and im living an active experiment.

His delusions are mainly persecutory in nature. He will for example, tell me that people are following him, taping his phones or trying to plant false evidence on his laptop to indict him. He reports overhearing snippets of conversations that reinforce these notions. He has some internal awareness that his mind is playing tricks on him but for the most part insists that he's not paranoid, just cautious. When I try to reason with him about the illogicality of his thoughts, he gets angry and frustrated with me, telling me I don't understand and am naive.

We've been to see a psychiatrist who prescribed risperadone. However, he doesn't like the drowsiness it induces and only takes 1 mg out of the 2 mg prescribed. Because the doctor is a university psychiatrist, he is limited in the drugs that he can prescribe. I keep urging him to go to a private doctor who can better tailor his medication to suit his needs but he insists that people will find out and he doesn't need it anyway. He's functional enough to convince me that I don't need to forcefully drag him to see someone. (should I?).

I'm at my wits end and would like to know how best can I, as a concerned party, help to prevent him from slipping into full blown schizophrenia. I want to be supportive but I don't want to enable his delusions. How can I best achieve that?",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

Ever since elementary school, I've struggled with paying attention, following directions, etc. I was diagnosed with ADHD-PI (ADHD without hyperactivity), but never put on medication until recently. When I finally given a stimulant treatment, it changed my life for the better. After a few months of stable treatment, though, I began experiencing psychotic symptoms, mainly paranoia and occasional voices. It wasn't very severe and the symptoms were rather infrequent, but I sought help anyway. I was then taken off stimulants because they were thought to exacerbate the symptoms. Afterwards the symptoms lingered for a few weeks then died away and the ADHD symptoms re-emerged. 

Anyway, the psychiatrist I'm seeing thinks that my attention problems are actually due negative symptoms of schizophrenia and thought disorders rather than ADHD. That's where he and I disagree. I seriously doubt that I've had a thought disorder since second grade, and I think the psychotic symptoms were caused by a negative reaction to the stimulants I was taking. I've read a few articles that say that stimulant psychosis can occur at therapeutic doses, and that it's actually harmless. I'll be discussing it with him next time I see him.

This is where I'd like your input. Have any of you experienced stimulant psychosis? How does it differ from schizophrenia-related psychosis? Have any of you also been diagnosed with ADHD?

Anyway, my Dad and my Step-Mom aren't really open to sharing information about his condition, but reading the local news from my hometown I saw that he had been living in Section 8 housing and killed his neighbor with a butcher's knife over a dispute of the neighbor's loud music. 

I had heard in the past that he had been using various drugs and unless fed his medication he wouldn't take it.  For whatever reason he lived alone in another house my parents owned, but he didn't do well there I guess.  My actual Mother said my brother heard he is hooked on heroin. I don't know how this drug would affect Schizophrenia, but it's easily available in my hometown and is a huge problem, so I could see this being true.  

The last time I saw him was two Christmases ago. Conversation with him was akward as I could tell I made him uncomfortable. I tried to treat him as I would treat everyone else.  My best friend was there and they went to the same high school so they knew some of the same people and talked about people from then.  That seemed to bring him out of his shell and though he didn't really make eye contact his speech seemed to become more relaxed and natural. 

Getting to the point; from the few times I've seen him his eyes seemed like he was hyper stimulated and his body language and speech seemed like he was barely holding on.  If I sound ignorant on the subject then I apologize because I most likely am.

I'm just wondering if his illness had anything to do with him killing this guy and what should of been done to prevent this. I've known him on and off since he was 4 due to my Dad and his weird relationship with said step-brother's Mom, but he was really good natured. I'm wondering if this was more drug driven, a combo of both, or if it is possible for some schizophrenic people to be pushed over the edge like that.

To my surprise they actually give me the pills I'm after. Depakote(voices), trazadone(sleep), and clonazeapam(anxiety). He doesn't argue about haldol, zyprexa, geodon, or seroquel.

I go in for the next appointment, see a PA. She asks how I'm feeling. I tell her I feel OK, that I just want my refills, and can they write it for more than one month. Money is seriously tight. Another surprise, she can write it for 3 months, then I have to see the doc again. Well, no problem, I'm actually feeling good about going to the doctor as well as feeling better in general.

Make my new appointment. There's a new woman I've never seen and the PA. I tell them I feel ready to up my depakote by 500mg. I've also since gotten a paying job. 2 .5mg clonazeapam aren't cutting it and I'd like to have the option of 3 1mg a day.

This is where it gets shitty. They step outside the door and shut it. I don't know if you're familiar with the term *Whispering in a Sawmill* but that's what this lady did.

But don't worry. Went back to the doctor. Got the meds back, seeing a new therapist and psychiatrist asap.

Thought weed was the problem so I stopped that for several months, can never be certain it *wasn't* the problem, but I have stopped long enough to know it's not just from weed.

Then explained how much of a hermit I had become, trusting basically nobody except my girlfriend and then not even her. Deleted my Facebook. Having trouble showering and taking care of myself and motivation in general, despite not feeling depressed. Becoming extremely deluded about basically all social situations imaginable. Constant mental garbage running through my brain which I had always categorized as ""racing thoughts"", removed my ability to read and write coherently. Only got my degree because I had an extreme amount of help from people telling me to STOP PUTTING TWO DIFFERENT SENTENCES NEXT TO EACH OTHER. Every single fucking paper I wrote had this all over it despite the fact that I thought it flowed perfectly.

And man, the seroquel might have actually helped the difference between honors and not. I fucking HATED taking that medicine but it allowed me to function. But oh man when I stopped taking it I felt so good and passionate about life, even though all I was doing was sitting at my computer making lists of meaningless bullshit all day. I could literally do this for hours. All of my social relationships have fallen apart completely. Personal threads of suicide to the few people I actually speak with, including my girlfriend.

The way I was acting just wasn't explained by being bipolar. And my failure to admit something was wrong with the way I thought was also why I thought I could stop taking my medicine.

I remembered talking about my medicine choices with the nurse and the psychiatrist told her she didn't want him on a mood stabilizer, she wanted me on an antipsychotic. And she also wanted further testing asap, which was four enduring hours. Turns out they could not make a diagnosis because of my hypomania, but some of the memory and coordination I had failed miserably despite hitting a very high percentile on others.

I distinctly remember acknowledging to myself that I wasn't going to look at or hear the results. And I didn't. I just said told myself, damn hypomania. Shucks. Never went back for any more testing.

It also explains people always telling me how wrong I am about a lot of things. Because my brain actually does put in ideas that aren't there, and it makes me cry to type that. One of the only things that ever can make me cry anymore is realizing that this mental garbage as I described it earlier, will never go away. But I think as long as I take this medicine, no more audible voices will come out of it.

Medicine should be kicking in soon. I go back tomorrow. Going to up my dose. Not sure if I should tell them everything or just some things. I have never actually told a therapist how much of a hermit I really am, I would either exaggerate, generalize, or find another way to avoid the subject.

To start off, I am a 19 year old college student and I have grown up practically my entire life with a schizophrenic father. I hold very few memories of what i believe my father to be ""normal"", and these are early memories of when i was barely starting kindergarten. As a kid, i never knew what illnesses like schizophrenia were, so i thought my dad was normal with even him actin strange. 

He would always think there were people out to get him and in the walls of our house and basically all the delusions and hallucinations that come with schizophrenia. It eventually got to the point where he shot off a gun in my house when i was a child, near me, my brother, and mother. This resulted in the police being called and they could finally take him away and hopefully help him.... he went to the hospital (i don't want to drag on the many events).

Long story short, he was away getting treated and i really missed him, cause i knew he was still my father. One of my greatest memories was when he came back, healthy and happy. I thought my life couldn't get anymore perfect. This was now around my later years of middle school. 

I basically had my dad back, as long as he took his meds. He was healthy and keeping up with them for a long time and it was great to have him back but then this fucker came and stole his truck. This really set him off... He started to skip his meds, and it is important to mention that he is a paranoid schizophrenic. He went out and actually found his truck parked near a corner, stripped of the stereo and some engine parts. 

This made his paranoia come back harder. Every day he looks out the window making sure nobody is messing with the house or his cars or us. My family feared the worst cause we personally witnessed his mental degradation. We tried everyday to get him back to his meds or to see a doctor and that we love him and want him to be healthy... but it was no use. My father can be really stubborn and stern on his decisions.

I know i have been dragging on, but his current state is really, bad. Talking complete nonsense, but no violent acts. Thank god. 

It is literally impossible for us to get to help him and both my mother and i have no idea what to do. I feel that this illness is depriving him and my family's life. Its almost like growing up without a father and it hurts to see him the way he is, suffering every single day.

I'm not sure what type she has, but she's been to the doctor/therapist and received medicine for it. I've listed out the things she's described to me. She is still on medicine, and you can definitely tell when it works (and when she's actually taking it). She's less afraid and talks about this stuff less.

**The things she sees/hears:**

* People sit in trees and watch her house. 
* People move things around her house, take stuff, and hide in the house.
* She thinks her neighbors are trying to steal her property. 
* She thinks one neighbor is sending people onto her property to spy on her.
* She complains that the neighbor is making ""that black smoke"" again.
* Stayed in her car for 3 days saying they locked her in there. 
* Tapes the door handles of her car so ""they"" can't get in. 
* Tapes up windows and small dark holes/openings that she says people use to look at her. 
* Says the neighbors use a ""spaceship disguised as a cloud"" to drop people off into the woods to spy on her.
* Says that people in the TV are asking her for money. 
* Says the neighbors put dead bodies in the woods next to her house. 
* Said she won a car and went downstairs to get it at 3am. 

**A little more history about her:**

She is also a hoarder, and has said it was due to depression from losing her youngest son (my uncle) and losing her husband not long after that. She has had two different types of cancer in the past, and we thought these things were being caused by a tumor on her brain but an MRI showed there wasn't anything. Then I believe she saw a therapist and got medicine.

He has 2 other siblings that have no symptoms, but his younger brother said that when he smoked weed one time, he had started to understand what my fiance was talking about with his schizophrenia, being paranoid that everyone around could hear him and was talking about him. My fiance believes that smoking is what triggered it, and explained it to me like ""points"". He said, ""It's like your brain has a point system when it comes to smoking(weed), and the more you smoke, the more the points are used up. After a while, those points are gone and your brain gets stuck there.""

I have my own...mental issues, for lack of a better term. I wouldn't say I hear voices, but I know that people anywhere can ""sign on"" and see what I see, see me, hear what I hear. And I know that it's whoever knows me or knows someone that knows me. They can't tell me that it's true, it's not allowed. So they lie about it, my fiance included. I'm wondering what the chance of any child him and I might have having schizophrenia. I've heard it runs in families. We want to have a child in 3-4 years, is the risk of schizophrenia worth it?",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

The first sound i first remember hearing was alot of people talking as if i was in a crowded room. Coulsnt make out what they were saying. Then i started hearing loud noises as if someone was smashing pots and pans in the room.

Now i have a couple of people who talk to me. Her nam is raven and his name is thomas they tell me that i am worth nothing and stupid and i should just jump off a building.

Last night i had a bad break down. I was watching some game grumps and i just started to hare 7 or 8 people just tell me that i am nothing and i need to die. And if i turned off my lights they would get me. When i was laying down in bed i had the feeling that there were people in my room and that they wanted to hurt me. I knew if i looked in that direction then they would hurt me. So i ended up having a pretty bad panic attack that i ended up passing out and not waking up till this morning when my alarm went off. 

This morning i was extreamly on edge and couldnt relax at all. I am really jumpy nd nervous about those people coming to get me. When i was driving to work they were telling me to watch the other cars because they wanted to run me off the road and kill me. I also had another panic attack while driving to work. Why are these voices telling me im so worthless and that these people are trying to kill me. 

What do i do??????

I've been dating a girl for a few months now and I'm wildly, passionately, madly in love with her. Like, it's too soon and a bit crazy, but I could marry her someday. She told me from the get-go that she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had dis-associative episodes. I've dated girls before who claimed to have this disorder or that disorder, but it mostly just seemed like they were seeking attention and just being...immature (I don't want to offend anyone by saying that, it's just how it came across to me. I've had exes threaten suicide simply because I was out with friends and having a good time. I felt manipulated, used, and lied to.) It was different with her; she seems so self-aware and honest and in control (to a point, obviously) and I wasn't really worried, even when she said I hadn't 'seen her bad sides.' She went to therapy and tried a lot of meds, but I knew she wasn't seeing anyone presently and was not medicating with anything other than marijuana. 

I guess I sort of romanticized it in my head, or went off of what movies portrayed, but I was assuming it would just be fun ""highs"" with some reckless behavior, sex, and needing to 'reign her in', and lows where she was sad and depressed and would need some extra love/affection/attention.

I saw her real low two days ago, when she got caught stealing, wrote a suicide note, and I came over and had to physically help her out of bed and wash her and get her dressed. She was so lethargic, exhausted, and just...not present. It was scary, but I love her and I told her I would stay. I'm planning on staying, but this is out of my realm. 

She's worried that bipolar disorder doesn't fit - it's never fit, she said - and that she's actually struggling with schizophrenia and/or DID. I can't lie, this is a lot. She's 100% deserving of love and I want to be by her side but I'm so scared she's in a spot where she sees some clarity and is going to get treatment, and then stop again in a few months. I'm willing to ride this rollercoaster with her because she's fucking amazing and perfect in every way, and I love the way her mind works, even though it's ""broken"" - her words - but just dealing with 48 hours of a dip (not sure what a low is called, but that was her term for it) has exhausted me and put my life on hold and that's not something I can do forever. I'm rational enough, even with the intense love I feel for her, to know that I could easily fall into being sick with her, and taking care of her over me. I don't want to do that, but I also don't want to abandon her because I love her. 

She's said she doesn't so much have ""highs"" as she has clarity and reprieve from stress. Right now though, the act of even breathing is hurting her, physically and emotionally. Her job is about to fire her and she's got a court date because of the theft. 

I don't know how to help her. It's the weekend so nothing is open aside from hospitals, and she doesn't want to go back. This relationship is new enough that I don't want to wreck her by taking her and having her admitted, and she seems to be getting ""better"" from this dip, but still a scary amount of depressed and giving up. She said she isn't going to kill herself, but that right now, being alive is so hard. I am planning on calling a lot of places Monday morning to see if I can get her in to see a doctor but I don't really know what I can do to be helpful. I know she can't pull herself out of this but I'm so scared that she's going to lean so fully on me that I won't have time for myself or my feelings. And then I feel guilty, because that's selfish as fuck. I dunno, I just need advice or recommendations or...something. I'm at a complete loss and I feel like I'm kind of drowning in this, and I know for a fact she is too and I just want to help her get this under control, for both of us. ",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

We’ve always known there was something a little off about my younger stepbrother. I come to reddit for help, because he’s lying to his psychiatrists (I’ll get to that later) and my stepdad refuses to believe there’s anything wrong with him, so he won’t fill out questionnaires honestly.

My younger stepbrother, let’s call him “Alex,” came into my life when I was 9 and he was 4. My younger brother, we’ll call him “Josh,” was 6 and thus was closer in age to Alex and played more with Alex. About a year after my mom and stepdad got married, my stepdad became obsessed with work. Since he was never home, Josh basically had to raise Alex. Josh taught Alex manners, what was right and wrong, how to play sports, everything your dad is supposed to do. Alex was diagnosed with ADHD at a very young age, so as you can imagine he was quite the handful. He’s been on just about every medication imaginable. Alex annoyed the every living shit out of me, but Josh was extremely patient and quickly became Alex’s idol. 

Around age 11, Alex started telling my parents he was hearing voices. Not only that, but he was wildly misinterpreting what people were saying. You could ask him to switch seats at the dinner table, and he would run away crying saying that you had just told him you hated him. My parents described it as some kind of disorder, but I can’t remember off the top of my head what it was. It was chalked up to be from all the medications he was on, so they quickly changed medications. As far as I know, once the medications were changed the voices and the misinterpreting decreased. He still continued to talk to himself though.

Alex also asked the strangest questions, like “If dinosaurs existed, and then you made them macaroni and cheese, would they light on fire?” Questions that made absolutely no sense at all. Not just when he was younger, but even up until he was 15. But we were used to his oddness, so we always brushed off his questions. He also refused to try any new foods, even as he got older. While everyone else was trying out new things, Alex was eating the same 5 things – PB&amp;J’s, spaghetti, pizza, chicken strips, and pancakes. Nothing else. Not sure if that has anything to do with it, but I really felt like his mental capacity was always 7 years behind. He was also VERY into conspiracy theories, maybe even obsessed. He’s very, very paranoid. Also, I should mention that his mom is bi-polar.

One day, Alex decided to “reveal” to his school counselor how for the last 8 years he had been “sexually assaulted” by Josh. This was COMPLETLEY out of the blue. He stated how I had walked in on them multiple times, stated, “this is too weird,” and let it go on (This most certainly did NOT happen). There was an investigation with the local police station, but it quickly was dropped as anybody who knew Josh knew it was complete and utter bullshit. Josh is the greatest person I know, he has never raised his voice at me, we’ve never fought, he’s just an all around good guy. Alex wanted to be JUST like Josh, Alex hung out with Josh everyday, you would think if Josh was “Fucking him in the ass” like Alex was saying, Alex would not be so eager to spend every waking second with Josh. He also explained that he had become addicted to gay porn, so we believe he perhaps he couldn’t distinguish reality from that. I don’t doubt that maybe as little boys they did the whole “I’ll show you mine if you show me yours,” but you have to understand that there was no sexual assault as he was stating. The police suggested that whether Alex’s statement was true or not, it would not be wise for Josh and Alex to live in the same house. Alex has lived with his mom for the last year. 

When Alex moved to his mom’s house, he got a dog. On a walk one day, a man complimented Alex on his dog. The man, having his own dog and having treats on his parson, gave Alex’s dog a treat not thinking anything of it. But in Alex’s mind, this man was trying to poison his dog. Alex ran home, grabbed a knife and was on his way back to the park to stab the man who had “poisoned” his dog, but was stopped by his mom before he could. There have been multiple other occasions where Alex has ran into people on his walks and attempted to return with a knife.

The problem with diagnosing Alex is that my dad refuses to believe his son could have Schizophrenia. Doctors have given him multiple questionnaires to fill out, but because my stepdad wasn’t an active part of his life growing up and Josh raised him, he can’t accurately fill them out.  Alex keeps telling his psychiatrists lies about Josh, and since the psychiatrists haven’t known him all his life like my family has, I don’t see any reason why they would feel he was lying.

I appreciate any advice and feedback on whether you guys feel this could be Schizophrenia or not. I also have a bunch more stories if need be. ","['pobj', 'nsubjpass']",-1,neu_vader

My grandmother is 83 years old and she is currently the caregiver for my 56 year old aunt who has schizophrenia. My uncle and mother currently live in the same area as my aunt, but neither want anything to do with my aunt because of her unpredictable (and sometimes dangerous) behavior. My cousin (my aunt's son) also lives nearby, but he's not really dependable and not really in a position to care for her (doesn't have a car, works part-time, and smokes too much marijuana). I live out of the country, so I'm not much help, but I do help my grandmother look up information/resources when needed. 

My grandmother drives to make sure my aunt takes her medicine, she picks up the rx from the pharmacy, takes her grocery shopping, and helps her run errands. It's time-consuming and my grandma always seems so exhausted after running around because as my aunt always says ""she's not chicken of the spring anymore.""

No one is really addressing the white elephant in the room which is who (if anyone) will help my aunt when my grandmother can no longer do it anymore. Quite frankly I don't think she should be doing it now, but she does it anyway. 

I'm curious if anyone in this subreddit has ever dealt with a situation similar to this? How supportive has your family been? I haven't really found many resources on aging parent of a child with schizophrenia, but I know my grandmother can't be the only one.

anyways, to get to my story, this is just something I wish I could just unremember. I mean I guess its not that bad, but to me it was awful.

wall of text.. but i gotta get this off my chest since I dont talk about this stuff to anyone in real life.

going back about 5 years ago:

One day I came home from school, and saw my mom sitting on the couch, I said hey mom, what are you doing here? (she's not allowed at our house at the time, she went crazy one day and started smashing dishes for no reason - she did that too often, so we had to get the cops involved cause she was trying to attack my dad and my brothers had to hold her down) im guessing she probably got in through the side door which we often left unlocked.

so she was sitting on the couch with a bunch of our albums from when we were babies, and so on. she was ripping up all our baby pictures in half. I said what are you doing! those are our memories! So i tried to take my album away from her. she wouldnt let go and said
""I took these pictures, I can do what I want with them!"" but after a bit of a struggle, she let go, and went onto the next album.

I put mine away where she couldnt find it because those were the only pictures i have as a baby. and went back to the living room, and saw her tearing up more pictures. it was the album of their marriage. I supposed I should've just let her do what she wanted with those. since they were divorced. But I wanted to keep the few memories I had of my parents when they were happy, and my mom wasnt a complete psycho. these photos dated back since the 70s and 80s 

So I wanted to keep those, as memories. So i said stop! and tried to take those away. she said that one was hers not mine. but I took it away, and thats when she flipped out.

she started screaming and yelling, and I told her to ""Get out!"" I pointed at the door. and she wouldn't leave, she went to the kitchen and started throwing our dishes again, smashing dish, after dish, and yelling at me. she would never directly throw the dishes at me or anyone, I think she just does it to express her anger or something, but while she was yelling at me, she was moving closer to me, and I was moving backwards, until I was cornered in the kitchen.

I had about enough, so I yelled back at her and said ""get the fuck out mom!"" she grabbed me by the shirt and tried to threaten me. I know she would never actually hurt me. But I was sick of her shit. I grabbed her by her wrists and showed her to the door. Sorry if I sound like a bitch here, but I couldn't take it anymore.

by the time we got to the door, she was beginning to struggle more, and holding her self on the door frame so I couldn't lock the door. I eventually got her to the other side of the door, but she was still struggling to keep it open. and finally she gave up. and I was able to lock it. 
from behind the door she was yelling at me to let her in. I said NO! obviously. I was crying my eyes out at this point. 

Finally shit went quiet. a little too quiet. I guess she left. I said no.. wait.. I ran as fast as I could across the living room, across the kitchen over a bunch of broken dishes to get to the side door and lock it. I was able to lock it just on time. just seconds later she was there trying to turn the knob, and banging on the door. 

I called my brother and told him about what happened, and I was crying my eyes out. he had to leave work early, and make sure I was okay. because He knows exactly how she is.

there was one more place she was able to enter from. man i was scared shitless to go to the basement. Our basement at the time was creepy as fuck. long creeky hallway, and dim lights that didnt work very well. I know she could probably climb in through the window.

thats what my bros and I used to do to get in the house when we forget to bring our keys. but the windows are really high, so she probably wouldn't of been able to get down. But I had to check anyway.

so I slowly started heading down the stairs, still crying, i did not want to do this. and there was no door to lock the basement apart from upstairs.

so i was walking down the creepy ass hallway, checking every door, and space, couldnt turn on the light til you got to the main room.
well finally I got to the main room, and she was half there..

half her body was sticking in through the window, I guess she didnt want to drop from that window, as there was no where comfy to land on. but with the lighting and her crazy hair, I was terrified.

thats all I remember from that point. I think she gave up and left. my bro finally got home after an hour or so, and we were able to salvage some of the torn up photos.

I haven't seen her in years. she's currently back home now, creating the same problems for people shes around or living with. her own family members do not know how to help her.

she wasnt always like this. she was a normal very loving mother at one point. then she stopped taking meds, because she doesnt trust doctors. I really want to help her, and want the best for her, but she needs to let us help her. she is so set in her own ways that she refuses to believe anyone wants to help her.

I dont know what to do. thoughts? help? opinions? is this schizophrenia? or bipolar or something? what can I do to help her.

tl;dr - venting about this one time my mother scared the fuck out of me and made me cry.

well she did this often enough, but this particular time, I was alone, and didnt know what to do.

I just stumbled upon this subreddit and I thought I could ask you guys for some help. My brother started developing schizophrenia about 5 or 6 years ago and it's unfortunately not getting better. His mental disorder has negatively influenced nearly every facet of his life. He's unemployed, isolating himself (doesn't talk to anyone outside of our family anymore), he doesn't have any hobbies and his social skills are lacking.

He's been taking meds for years but I'm not seeing any improvement in his health at all. The voices he's hearing won't stop belittling him and his mood swings are getting worse and worse. Some days he's having these manic highs and other days - when he starts hearing those voices again - he gets terribly depressive again.

My question to you guys (as his sister and as someone who can't take seeing him like that anymore) is how can I help him at all? I don't fully understand schizophrenia yet which is why I've been trying to educate myself more, but it would be a lot more helpful to get advice from people who can relate and who struggle with schizophrenia themselves. I try to talk to him regularly without coming across too pushy but he won't open up about it. What can I do?

Thanks in advance. ",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

Want to kill myself. Want to cut more than that, even more. Red is pretty.

SO alone. No power. Gotta be brave. Can't stand up, not righteous. 

Been getting shots of meds once a month. It's not working. Everything is floating. The words, in space. I can see the air move, did you know that? If you stare at the object your eyes register the particles in space. We're in space. Objects. Floating. I miss Firefly. Feel like River. Alone. I don't want to be alone.

I'm so sad but I'm a GOD. Can't get it out of my head, it hurts. 

There are people suffering. Every city. They're everyone. But who are they? They're screaming and whispering and I see people with the power to control light but no one bats an eye when this man counts coins made out of energy. HE CAN CONTROL THE LIGHT. Was he a demon? Demons live inside me. I won't let them be free. I saw this man. No one looked at him even though he had energy in has palms. 

I saw him in a store and nobody saw him. First thought was he was a spy, watching me, knowing. Second thought was how was he controlling the light? Was he a God too? My God? A watcher? 

I'm so tired. My head feels heavy. The voices aren't so bad but when they come they make me feel awful. I'm scared for their safety. Gotta be brave. Be a hero. Save them all. I'm their savior they said. Am I anything? Maybe I'm nothing. It's possible. I just need to sleep, haven't been doing so. So busy at work, too much work. Stress. It'll kill me.

They're in my home and they haven't the right. I miss Firefly. 

I talk in quotes because it makes me feel better. 

I have razorblades. A recipe for unpleasantness. Why am I doing this? Gotta vent. Please tell me it's ok. I need to say things to stop it from roaming in my head, running my mind. Are they lies? I can't tell. I might be being deceived. That happens too often. One time I was molested as a kid because I thought he was my best friend. He died and I went undercover to his wife as a mourning person, but she gave me his picture and I keep it for reference. He doesn't look like a demon but is most definitely from hell.

""Help me"" is what they mostly say. There's a part of me in another world. I can hear the space between dimensions. She knows about it. 

I just want to scream. Nobody will understand. This is my soul. It's all I have. These people are my soul. They're in a dimension that's apart of my very being, did I create them? I did. I created their world but why are they false when they're true? They won't understand. 

Wish I could tell my friends but they're work friends. Can't comprehend. Will think I'm strange. So I talk in my monotone voice that I have no control over, in Firefly quotes at work, no one understands. But they smile and say hi because I'm not such a monster. I'm just a God. They don't believe. They won't. Can't say a word but can try to appear like I know I should. 

Bangs dry, clothes matching, shoes, check, put on some makeup and tell a story. It's all lies, I hate it. It doesn't mean what you think. 

I wish they knew what I know. I wish I wasn't scared to show.

I miss my therapist. I miss him. Haven't seen him in 5 months. No therapy. I tried to kill myself, traumatized him, we needed a break. Got kicked out of school and have to get permission to go back, because I tried to jump off the parking structure with a slit wrist. Dangerous. 

I wish they could open their eyes and see these people. See the magic and the same. The man with the light, the woman from war, the aliens. I've seen these things but I know people can't process. They're broken. 

It's at 40%. Trying to function. Do you get it? I'm trying so hard but my eyes won't stay open. I want to write the code but I'm broken.

Most immediately you notice it through tingles in your scalp and maybe also spine and body (like getting the chills) but in addition it also feels very pleasant and comforting, in a warm and calm and sleepy kind of way. It may last quite a bit until you basically just snap out of it, like hypnosis trance but different. There are lots of videos on youtube now specifically engineered to just trigger the effect as often as possible (wearing headphones in a quiet environment while paying attention is essential). 

This is just a very good example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgOOSP7ZDio

Now from what you can tell on the internet it seems like either you basically have it or don't have it and it doesn't seem to be harmful. Though still it seems that people who have it more than often report having anxiety problems, also sleep difficulties and social difficulties which the ASMR effect helps against. And sometimes you will find people like me who essentially learned how to get the effect afterwards. Scientific knowledge about it basically doesn't exist, it so to speak suddenly emerged on the internet and people who do not experience it often have a very hard time grasping what it is and is not at all.


So if you have it, does it help against psychosis/hallucinations/anxiety? Does it work worse or not at all on medication? Maybe you can learn it with youtube videos like I did and use it for your advantage. Would be interesting to know.",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

I haven't had this particular delusion in a long time, and I think i've worked past them, but other delusions come up sometimes and I have a hard time convincing myself otherwise, if i even want to convince myself otherwise.

This started very lightly at around 18 and the polar extremes have solidified a bit at my current 22. 

These things are laced with a clinical perennial depression. The depression gets worse when other symptoms get stronger, specifically a loss of connection to reality.

I'm currently writing a feature film about a character whose mother has schizophrenia.  The mother is onscreen for about the first ten minutes of the film, but her presence is felt throughout.  

My biggest desire is to portray an accurate reality of someone wrestling with this disease - both the bad and the good, if possible.   I'd like to find a way to show she's a human being wrestling with an illness - she herself is not the illness.

That said, here's my basic plotline:

The film opens with the daughter (17 years old, living alone with her mother) answering the door of their apartment.  It's just someone harmless - maybe a door to door salesman, maybe someone else.  When the daughter closes the door, the mother has been watching from the other room, and she grills the daughter on who the person was and why they came here - as if she's trying to catch the daughter in a lie.  

The daughter's fed up and leaves the house for a few days.  When she's returned, the mother has stopped taking her medication.  The mother is now having intense aural and visual hallucinations and has begun to panic, leading to a spiral where she ultimately tries to kill herself.  The daughter saves the mother's life and calls 911.  The mother is put on a temp psych hold.

This brings me to my questions:

Is what I have laid out a fairly accurate representation of what you have experienced?  

Are there details I've missed or things I've misunderstood?  

What kinds of medication have you found to be the most effective in at least quieting the voices, if not stopping them? 

Have you ever stopped taking your medication? If so, how long did it take before the symptoms returned?  

Thank you guys so much for any help you can give.  It really is very important to me that I portray this as accurately and powerfully as possible.  And I want to show the mother as a human being - I want to show that people with the diagnosis of schizophrenia are still people.  They're just dealing with something that is truly difficult to handle.  Please let me know if I understand it correctly, and please feel free to correct me if otherwise!

I feel so stupid, my speech does not reflect my thoughts. I can focus ok, and be pretty productive. But when I speak to people I stumble over all my words and say the same word's meaning with 3-5 other things to try and make it clear but it's all over the place.

For example, at work I a coworker asks where a file is. 

I'll go with ""the company folder, the y drive, here I'll send you the path"" like I feel it necessary to explain in so many ways.

It'll just be a mess, and I feel like I'm embarrassing myself. Is this what disorganized speech is? For me I mumble the same thing in different ways and I swear it's clear as day but I always get, ""what?"" because nobody understands me. 

How do I even know if it's a side effect vs an effect of my Schizophrenia? 

I feel like I'm retarded(as my mom called me the other day when I was trying to say one thing but said it 4 different times to explain correctly). I feel awful, like I'm losing my way to communicate effectively. I write well but sometimes my thoughts are so jumbled and it comes out worse in speech and I ALWAYS forget what I'm doing, all the time. Sometimes while talking it'll be like I wasn't in the middle of the conversation. 

Is this disorganized speech? Any way to help it?

""I can see she's been to the gym""
""This is a face for us""

I developed paranoid schizophrenia over the period of a few months when I was 15 and was diagnosed shortly after I'd turned 16. I had to leave school, began a homeschooling/tutoring regimen, lost all my friends, my self esteem, and my sense of identity. It seemed as though reality had been shattered beyond repair. I got almost no enjoyment out of anything. I've been on various medications and have tried group therapy but none of it seems to help much. It all seemed pretty bleak until just a few weeks ago.
     I was eating chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream on my couch. I'd mixed them together and it tasted sooooo good... The rich sweetness of the chocolate mixed with the cool taste of vanilla, it was perfect. When I finished eating I actually began to lick the plate, it was that good. I thought to myself ""this is nice"" and heard in my head ""is it?"" So I responded to the voice. I said, ""yeah, it is."" It immediately felt as though I finally understood my schizophrenia and now had some control over it. It gave me a sense of power, to acknowledge that I was having hallucinations, but that I wasn't going to give them any weight and would do my best to ignore them. I gained a bit of confidence and have been able to become more active and am studying harder now than I did even before I left school. It feels good.

It's too loud. They're everywhere, and they're saying NOTHING.

I survive to be background noise for the lives of everyone I know and everyone I cross paths with. I am background noise. Nothing. I am nothing. I'm just the girl sitting on the bus with her headphones, the girl in class taking notes. Never succeeding. Just there for visual effects.

Can anyone imagine the kinds of debates that would be taking place right now, if one of the American presidential candidates suffered from this illness? 

Would people be asking him: ""Well Mr. Johnson if you hear Gods voice telling you to nuke Russia, what would stop you from complying?"" 

He might say: ""Well I take my medication regularly and have been for 20 years. So there is no chance of me hearing the voice of God"".

The questioners might reply: ""Yes, but how can we be sure. Your record says..."".

That presidential candidate might have a genius IQ. A Nobel prize. He might have solved the most difficult scientific problem of his times.

First off, I'm quite ill; I have schizophrenia, OCD, PTSD and depression. These are just the mental illnesses; next to that, I also have sleep apnea, chronic pain, am overweight, and have cerebral palsy from a brain hemmorhage after birth, which causes me to be in a wheelchair.

I'm 21 and currently in my country's version of high school (because of above mentioned illnesses I had a couple years where I was too ill to function) and I live alone.

The relationship with my parents isn't good. The entire family on my fathers side has a history with substance abuse and psychosis, and most of them have been institusialized at some point in their lives. My father and mother both abuse alcohol and weed due to those being legal here. They've also had a history of cocaïne abuse. I don't speak with them because they don't believe in mental illnesses.

I have a twin brother who I barely have contact with, he isn't ill. I've tried to increase this contact but it's not being reciprocated from his side.

I'm gay and have never had intimate contact with anyone. I want to, but it feels like I'm lying to everyone and trapping them.
Until yesterday I had a roommate. Because of bad experience with my most recent medication I've attacked him 3 times; he left. I'm not angry but I am dissapointed in myself for not being able to control myself better.

I've tried so, so many different medicine. Anti-psychotics, both typical and atypical, anti-depressants, sedatives, even a lot of off-label options. My psychiatrist told me he'd basically threw the entire psychopharmacology book at me and there's nothing left that might work. The medicine either aggravates the symptoms or does nothing whilst side effects run havoc on my body. We don't know why, probably because of the brain hemmorhage I suffered.

I've stopped relying on others to be happy. I focus on what I like and want to do. This is mainly reading, baking and learning; however, because of all my problems I feel increasingly isolated. I have one good friend and a couple that, until this week, I thought I could trust. Instead they went behind my back and ignored me, to protect me. I understand it, yet I still feel abandoned.

I'm hoping someone in this subreddit will know what I could do to fix myself. I've tried medicine. I've tried psychologists (many of them have not acknowledged I have schizophrenia purely because I seem well-adjusted; one even told me I should kill myself to spare me my suffering).
 I've tried hobbies and friends. But I am so, so tired. I'm only 21. I don't know if I want to live to 30, 40, let alone 80. I'm getting more ill with the day, and I've read many horror stories here that people who don't use meds end up either dead, in jail, or lose themselves.

Well a couple of years ago I had many OCD behaviours that didn't affect me much but those thoughts were a bit stressing sometimes though. But with time, as I've grown up they've started being less noticeable and less stressing for me.

In March-April 2013 I found out that my older sister (she's 36 and I am 18) is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia for about 10 years and my parents hid it from me to protect me. My other sister (she's 31) is all right and healthy and she doesn't seem to be as affected as me of our other sister's illness. I found out because she had a really bad psychotic episode and they had to tell me what was happening. I was really sad and scared. I didn't want to accept it. She was fine until then but suddenly, she started refusing her medication so that's why that thing happened. I've started since then fearing this horrible illness. Those months I was feeling fear all the time and I couldn't sleep for 2 weeks at all and barely eat. I was scared of starting hearing voices and stuff. It was horrible....

But with time this fear has started being not that bad as I've got used to it and got other health problems (not mental problems) and I've been focused on them. But even though I've been really depressed because I am single and feel ugly, have a few friends and I have low self esteem. My mood has fluctuated a lot from good to bad. Recently, I've been isolating myself more than usual...I've always been shy and socially anxiuous but since my anxiety started I'm becoming more and more socially anxious..I am sick of getting out looking the way I do. 

But my schizophrenia fear has started again since the last week when my sister has had another psychotic episode (a really bad one that my parents wanted to bring her to the hospital..it was horrible. And I gotta mention that all these month she has had an epsiode every month because she's still refusing to take her meds in time and her episodes are getting worse and worse). I've started thinking that I am ill too again and I'm identifying with her again (she's got no social life..even much more worse than me) and now a lot of horrible thoughts come to mind mind like my parents want to kill me and I feel watched sometimes and it's just horrible.
And when I get in bed, before falling asleep I hear this random voices in my head that say random things until I fall asleep. These voices are not new though I've heard them for months but they haven't scared me much until now. But those thoughts are worrying me...

My other sister that is healthy is my parents' second child so maybe if she's healthy I am the one who gets the illness from the eldest sister..she started with anxiety too and then after an year schizophrenia appeared. Now it's almost an year since I've been suffering from anxiety and depression.
I really want to be a healthy girl and to have a social life and a boyfriend.
I don't want to live with my parents like her forever and make their lives a nightmare...

Thank you very much for reading my post. I am new here. And sorry if there are any grammar mistakes but English is not my main language.

IMAGES REMOVED - Ask others who already seen proof.

EDIT2: I am going to pursue a venture that I think might be fun for me and those on reddit.  I am going to try and raise money on a site like Kickstarter (probably something smaller) to capture me turning the table on these guys.  They think I had no idea what was going on and am delusional so no one would believe me if I said anything. With this I want to embarrass them by having them feel ignorant and not knowing that the whole world knows what is happening but them.  Personally I think it will be hilarious. 
The only real problem will be convincing people this is not staged.  Honestly I wish it was. I trust that once the cameras roll people will believe.

My idea is to do a 10 part webseries that captures their reactions while trying to figure out what is happening to their weed and operation.  
I can set up audio inside the grow house.
Hidden cameras on the inside and outside. 
Camera on the side gate where they would enter. 
Track the cars to see how many people are in on this with a GPS device.  This would help to see how many people thought they were keeping this from me. 
The episodes don't need to be long, just capture the reactions these guys deliver when they can't figure out what is going on, while they think so lowly of me that they won't even consider me a suspect.

The series will culminate in removing all the marijuana from the grow house. Capturing the response and hoping for an explosion on these peoples part when they question who in their group has stolen the supply.

Am I being delusional thinking this could be great entertainment?

EDIT: I just got discovered at the door of the shed when I was going to go in side to get more pictures and stock up. I was also going to replace the grow schedule with a scanned copy so I have the original with all the fingerprints on it.  
He opened the door and I said what are you doing? 
I replied that I heard something inside there.
After last time entering I would have been sure they knew someone was inside. 

Kinda pisses me off knowing that they think so little of me that they wouldn't give me the credit I deserve in not being that naive.  Maybe i am though since I am posting about this on the internet to anonymous strangers.

Really hoping this doesn't throw off my plans for the webseries *more of a pipe dream at this point anyway",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

Ever since I met him I've done everything that I can to support him and help him however I could, but recently his Schizophrenia is getting a lot worse and it's getting really hard to know what to do when things get out of hand.

None of the people working with him can suggest any meds that will work. And all of the people associated with his mental health have agreed that getting him sectioned is a lazy solution to something that can be sorted, somehow. As well as agreeing that in general it just makes him worse, regardless of medication or how he's treated.

He's very small (4'9) and underweight, has a terrible immune system and seems to react badly to any meds that he's given, at the moment he can't even take meds, eat or drink without feeling sick. 

There was a recent meeting, we more or less discussed what we should do, since we're all pretty much out of ideas. There are two simplified choices that can either help him a great deal, or ruin everything and put him back to square one.

We either focus on trying to sort out all of his disorders, either one by one or all together, and try to work around his physical health issues.

OR, Focus more on actually helping him cope with things, and being able to live with it, as well as focusing on helping him with anxiety.

All of the help he's been getting in the past has more or less been both of those put together, but we agreed that, that's just too stressful for him in general. (That wouldn't be an issue, but he has a weak heart and we've had a lot of scares in the past when he gets stressed out)


I'm really the only person he has who's classed as a carer/member of family, and the people who work with him have said that he's not open enough with them for them to be able to make such a big decision. (At this moment in time) The thing is, the people who he actually works with (CAMHS) don't seem to be very good at their job... they have this 'You have to help yourself' approach to it, and don't support him at all, same goes for people working with him.


What should I do? I really can't decide, I've been thinking about it for ages, thinking of different scenarios, as well as worrying about how it'll effect how he sees me.

I know this might be a bit allover the place, so sorry if that annoys any of you.

A few months ago, my brother had a psychotic episode, and though he hasn’t been diagnosed formally yet it’s likely he has schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. At first, he just thought that his friends were talking shit about him whenever he left the room, but his beliefs kept growing and getting more bizarre. He was hearing voices outside his apartment window describing what he was doing/thinking, and talking about him negatively, and the places he heard the voices expanded. Eventually, he came to believe that there was a conspiracy where an unknown group of people were stalking him and spying on him. 

Luckily, he told a family member about this and we were able to get him in to see a doctor. He is currently hooked up with a therapist and a psychiatrist, but I’m still worried about him. He refuses to take anti-psychotics because that would mean that he’s “crazy,” and he still smokes tons of weed which in my opinion augments his hallucinations and delusions. I feel like I’m getting more and more frantic about him, and that a lot of our interactions now center around my trying to get him to take medication and quit the damn weed. 

In your interactions with family members, what was helpful and what wasn’t helpful? Should I keep bringing up the medication or just let it drop? I love my brother deeply, and I don’t want to drive him away through nagging, but I also don’t want to miss an opportunity to get him early treatment.

She is in her late 20's, (im 23). She was diagnosed at 19 i think. She was a weirdo from the start  (of our friendship) but recently its been VERY weird. In the beginning of our friendship she seemed slightly immature at times and had some scattered thinking (it seemed so in conversation) and perhaps not the best self-awareness. Still, she was ""normal"" and we had a great time together, (we still do.)

But lately somethings off. Conversation is different - I dont know to explain it but she just doesnt make sense half the time shes talking, I cant explain it. She told me she went of her meds, I told her thats the dumbest fucking thing ive ever heard and she explained that she can keep it together and its all about concentration. (At which point drunk me laid down on the floor and groaned. Drunk me is not the best at dealing with shit). I told her that she HAD TO consult with her doctor, she disagreed.

The ability to concentrate is something she mistakes for being not psychotic. she thinks schizophrenia is just being bad at concentrating ""people who dont have concentration-difficulties dont get stuck thinking about stuff that I get stuck thinking about"". I challenged this nonsense and we spoke for some time about it, I grew increasingly uncomfortable. This isnt normal...right? 

She told me she couldnt afford to do something I suggested because she lost her money calling a phoneline of psycics. She said the was over that delusion now (thats how she put it) because she decided it wasnt making her happy so she should stop thinking about it.

The other day I was at her place, we were cooking and i went to get her laptop to play music. If was hooked up to a router (?) attached to the wall (I dont know what im talking about here) and I asked why she didnt have a wireless ...thingy (still dont know what the fuck im talking about) and she explained that wifi used to/still does freak her out because she started thinking about how people could access her computer that way. We talked about this but I quickly dropped it. I didnt understand the sentences that were coming out of her mouth. 

Yesterday we had a 1 hour conversation about the reasons she wants to get a job in the future (she doesnt work and doesnt have to). The reasons she gave for wanting to work didnt make any sense what so ever, in any way, to any person on the planet, and it seriously freaked me the fuck out. I kept thinking I had misunderstood her (nope), she kept wanting me to understand, and....it was deeply unsettling and exhausting.
The conclusions she comes to on her own - on any subject- are completely insane.

Shes gets influenced by tvshows that she watches, that was the case with both the psycic thing and the work thing and other stuff as well. Television is not something she should be watching, shes like a sponge in a way. See something on tv - freak out about something more or less related to what she watched.

She seems fine in casual conversation, I dont think a stranger would pick up on anything being wrong, but that doesn't necessarily mean everything is okay, right? What do I do, if anything? I really, really dont like this not one bit. Im gonna try and see her tonight, I feel like its a better idea to see her often then to stay away in hope that she goes back to ""normal"". I dont know if I should say anything to her about wanting her to see her doctor.
I cant ask anyone for input because its not like she has told me its okey-dokey to talk about her diagnosis to anyone else, much less discuss these recent concerns of mine. But i NEED to vent, I need advice, Im deeply uncomfortable and worried.

Like all married couples, the possibility of having children comes up every now and again.  My husband has days where he likes the idea, and others where he wants nothing to do with it.

This subject has never been an easy one to discuss, and while i realize that the both of us are still young, only 24, and we do have time, I feel that our talk of children should happen soon, and in a serious, and definite way.
I know i can not force him to make up his mind if he is just not sure, but I do need him to understand that this is something i want in life, and will not give up.

He's told me that in recent years other than still drinking every day and smoking every day she has done a lot less strange things, and seems more in tune with reality. Things she has done in the past include attempted kidnapping of her children and leaving some things in a phone box to then call the police and report a suspicious package.

Maybe you're going through something similar, or you know someone who is going through something similar. And if you do, you should walk in to the local recruitment office and sing a round of ""Alice's Restaurant"" and walk out (Arlo Guthrie). Just kidding. That's from a song. I hope this helps.

So, I was a problem youth. I had high grades, but I started drinking and taking marijuana on a regular basis on weekends when I was 13 and 14. I learned that many people with schizophrenia are prone to teen alcohol- and drug-use. I was kicked out of summer camp when I was 15 for doing drugs, which felt like the whole world was crumbling at the time, even though at the time I remember thinking that in ten years it would be distant memory. 

My friends changed a few times in high school, so I spent a good deal of time with my groups of friends, getting to know them and that. Drugs and alcohol were always a strong foundation for my friendships. I threw beer parties at my parents' house. I exhibited my self-destructive behavior by crashing cars when I got my license. I have been in more than a dozen car accidents caused by me, some involving other cars.

I started to keep a journal and have strange dreams around 11th grade. My aspirations changed. I had seen university as a definite goal and life-time achievement until I suddenly thought it was going to ruin my ""street cred"". I thought I should drop out of high school and hitchhike across the country living on the street. I ran away from home several times my senior year after I was accepted to an ivy league university. 

When I went away to university I couldn't keep up with school work. I skipped class and missed assignments. I stayed up all night smoking marijuana and writing in my journal. I wandered outside at night and sometimes walked ten or fifteen miles. I wasn't eating enough I think partially because I couldn't get myself to the cafeteria during the daytime when it was open. 

I started going to parties three to four nights a week. I was lost at least once and didn't return until after sunrise. One time on a Friday, I crashed a party a couple miles from school and begged the host to let me crash there because it was a freezing night and I was too lost to walk back. Something good that came of my gregariousness is that 
I met my current best friends at a frat party I took my roommates to.

I was raped in my first semester of college by a man. I thought I had consensual sex and came out as gay to my roommate and friends of mine, all the time wondering why I didn't have fantasies about men. I spiraled. In my second semester I got in a fight with my roommate and was kicked out of the dorm. My grades stagnated and I took an academic leave of absence.

I went to some local universities staying with my parents and went back to school a year later. I failed a class my third semester and was expelled from an ivy league college. I continued to do low quality work at local universities until I had a psychotic break in March 2011. My parents demanded I seek therapy. I was opposed to therapy and wanted to continue with the way things were going.

In retrospect, I was influenced by the culture of masculinity. Men are messaged with images and stories about men who take responsibility for themselves and who are rewarded when they take responsibility for others, though to do so is of secondary importance. I wanted to be able to control the actions of my life. To me, to take advice from a stranger, even one trained to help people in my position was anathema to maintaining control.

There is a strong stigma about taking psychoactive medication that prevents people from talking about it. But, anti-psychotics are particularly derided. There is a myth, or partial truth, that anti-psychotic medication turns people in to zombies, or, more realistically drain a person of motivation and energy. I would not have sought treatment, therapy, or medication until my parents threatened to kick me out of their house. I was eventually on a regimen with anti-psychotic, stimulant, and anti-anxiety medications.

About a month after I started taking the medication I had a memory of child sexual abuse and recalled the rape I experienced in college. I was taking classes at a local university and my grades started to pick up. I walked in to my chemistry professor's office and asked for an internship and got it. I took the medication regularly for six months in the first half of 2012. In the summer I went cold turkey. 

I continued to excel at university. A year later, my psychiatrist gave me a path of ""partial remission"" (WHO, ICD-10). After four semesters I transferred to another university and became the senior member in a new program. I was operating as a highly motivated and involved student, designed my own major and led student initiatives on campus. I formed close relationships with women and shared my memories of child sexual abuse in a support group.

I graduated with honors in May 2014 and spent the summer in Europe as a gift from my parents. When I got back I wanted to find a job and a girlfriend and I decided to start therapy once a week. I really wanted to talk about my child sexual abuse. 

The character of my child sexual abuse became darker and I saw myself hurting others. I have been having trouble maintaining my reality about my past. I am concerned that I have a hard time differentiating dreams and false memories from reality. I shared these thoughts with my therapist and we are thinking about going back on the anti-psychotics.

So, that's sort of where I have been. I was a member of this subreddit earlier. I think that our stories are a really important part of our community. Stories show the humanity of people with schizophrenia. We have oppressed experiences that others need to hear to understand where we have been and break the social stigma of schizophrenia.","['dobj', 'conj']",-1,neu_vader

So a few days ago my psych takes me to a doctor and the doctor says that I have/had psychosis and he plans on getting me on some anti psychotics soon but they need to check my heart first. After going through hell a few months ago with my major depressive phase, now I'm just changing throughout the hours from depressive to mixed.

I'm going to copy and paste one of my posts eariler today, and I'd like it very much if anyone could answer the questions at the end and help me with those, thanks. 

I went to a doctor with my psychiatrist and I may be getting Aripiprazole/Abilify soon, they need to check my heart first, I've offically had psychosis, he said it was my first episode or something like that, my mood is changing throughout the hours, I'm getting a mix between my good and my bad phases, but I'm getting everything except the damn euphoria, while feeling depressed, god damn it. They want me to go to some group thing, people with psychosis around my age go out together and do some kind of activity, this Wednesday it's bowling, I don't think I'll go, I need to get my paranoia treated first and I'm not really the social type. I feel like I may last another few years, which I suppose is an improvement, but I don't really see a future ahead of me, the weather has been crazy, thunder and lightning, I suppose it matches my mood at the moment, I'm feeling depressive at the moment and just kinda dead. Now I'm reading up on the side effects of this medication, which I really shouldn't be doing. If anyone can tell me what this medication is like and their experiences with it, that'd help. Also I'm not completely sure that it is this medication, I forgot the name of the medication and had to look up a list of every anti psychotic, and I looked through it looking for one to jump start my memory, and I think that it may have been this one, it began with an Ap, and the doctor said it's a very gentle anti psychotic and it's supposed to cause restlessness quite often. Another name for Abilify is Aripiprazole so, maybe it was this? I don't know, basically if you have any suggestions on what else it may have been please tell me and also tell me what you can about this drug, thanks guys, I'm really hoping that this makes my hallucinations less severe.

I (24F) met my BF (24M) in December 2011. We moved in together in August 2012. He's always been a little wacky, but it wasn't anything beyond eccentric. He is an incredible, driven, amazing man. But his mother has schizophrenia and I think he does too.

He had once told me that his parents put him in the psych ward when he was 19, around the time his son was born. It took a long time to get all the details, because originally he implied it was just him having a breakdown and his parents overreacted. He doesn't have the best relationship with his parents and would be furious if I talked to them about this. 

In October 2013, something started to get off. A few days beforehand, he started being very critical of me (which I took as stress, he had stopped smoking weed to get a job, he was having money troubles, etc -- since then I've noticed that I can tell when an episode is coming because he starts criticizing me in a certain tone of voice). And that night it all comes out. He was actually in the psych ward because he was concerned people were stealing his ideas (apparently like they stole his grandather's). He'd been on some medication in the psych ward that he said was an antidepressant. When I looked it up (I can't remember the name anymore) it was also used to treat schizophenia. He had skipped a baseball game and called his dad to tell him that he was going to ride his bike to Pennsylvania. He was having very vivid visions of being ""back in Egypt"" when magic was real. Then he freaked out because he told me about his visions. Then he went on a rant about how he's being watched and could disappear any day. I was internally freaking out that this man I've known for TWO YEARS is suddenly not acting like himself. I just listen, because I don't know what else to do.

The next morning he seemed normal. I google schizophrenia, knowing that his mother has it. I essentially find that the entire night seemed textbook schizophrenic, filled with delusions of granduer and persecution. 

I confront him and say, ""You know last night seemed kinda paranoid shizophrenic? Kinda like your Mom?"" And he says, ""Yeah, she's crazy too."" I didn't know what else to say so we didn't talk anymore about it. I thought, this only happened after two years together, it might not happen again.

But in February 2014, it did happen again. We were on our way to the fair and all of a sudden he wants to rant about corporations and government conspiracies. A good hour of him ranting by himself on this topic and how me and him are different and the government doesn't want people like  us around. We're standing in line and for no reason at all he's convinced I'm in the way and I absolutely HAVE to stand in THIS CERTAIN SPOT because it's the only spot not in the way (it wasn't). I get frustrated and say to him, ""You know you're being like your Mom?"" And he says, ""No, because when she's like this she doesn't make sense."" And I look at him, and I say, ""You only make sense to you. You aren't being normal you."" And he just stares at me but he tones down the conspiracy talk. Over the course of the day he comes back to his normal self.

It happened again yesterday. I knew it was coming, he has been stressed, not smoking, and trying to find a new job. He had been bickering with me all morning and started bickering with our friends as soon as we got there. Two hours later we go to a pool party and for an hour and a half he sits next to me and is intensely ranting in my ear. Our friends are watching him and looking confused and I'm just shaking my head like, ""oh, it's just my quirky boyfriend again!"". He was telling me that he has extrasensory perceptions - if someone pulled up in the driveway he would instantly know. He said the two of us are on different wavelengths than other people and that he has 37 different things going on in his head at once. He said he knows an FBI agent or private investigator is checking on him every month. He goes on a twenty minute rant about his son's mother and how he was so dumb with just a skull full of rocks. He told me has has something called oppositional defiant disorder, though I don't see that as much. At one point he says, ""You know I'm like my Mom."" and I'm just ""Yes, I know."" and he says, ""You're the only person I can tell about this stuff. You're the only loved one. Who else can I tell about what I'm going through? It's gotta be you.""

I dunno. I'm concerned. I thought I could let it go, but it seems like it continues to happen and I know he's at the age where this manifests and could get worse. I don't feel like he'd be open to treatment, assuming it's just going to put him on medication to make him ""not himself"" (I hear him arguing already). He's an all-natural fitness junkie. I don't even know if once every few months is enough to warrant seeing someone. He must realize he's having an episode? He must remember what he said afterward? I can't even imagine what it's like in his head. I'm also a little afraid that if he refuses to get help that he won't open up to me like he has been about all this stuff in the future. And I can deal with these sporadic episodes now that I realize what they are, but what if this effects his son? Or his future career? Am I even supposed to be agreeing with the crazy things he says?

I know his delusions feel real to him. I'm just afraid it will get worse and I don't want that to happen. He had a Navy Seal contract that was taken away because his medical record showed he'd been in the psych ward. I know that's one of his biggest disappointments. I guess I'm just hoping for advice from people more familiar with this. This has been happening so frequently after never happening for two years and I'm lost on what to do. I'm certain it's only going to keep getting worse? :(


**TL;DR:** Met my BF in Dec 2011 and all was normal. In Oct 2013 he came clean about being in the psych ward for visions, then went on paranoid rants about being watched. Had another paranoid episode in Feb 2014. Just had one yesterday (July 2014), filled with grandeur and paranoia. Not really sure the best thing to do.

I have been telling people for the last couple years that I am medication free.  While true in most senses, I have been an extremely heavy smoker.

Well, 4 months ago I quit smoking, as I had developped a cough so bad that I couldn't even get through a single cig anymore.  I switched to ecigs, and consumed quite a bit of nicotine that way instead up until about a week ago, when I tried quitting completely.  

What I found, when I tried quitting completely, was that I landed right back in the same horrorland I had been a citizen of before I started taking risperdall even.  

I realize now that the nicotine (which I read is itself an anti-psychotic) was much more key than I believed it to be.  I now feel very bad that I led others to believe that it is possible to be schizophrenic without medications.  

However, I believe that it is possible that once the withdrawal symptoms disappear, I will be stable again.  But holy shit, right now, I am definitely not doing too well.  

Overall I find myself extremely suspicious of people again.  I find myself reacting to others in ways that they consistently report to be seemingly disconnected (they tell me I'm ""way out there"" with my responses, that I'm jumping to conclusions nowhere close to what they meant).  

Overall, I seem to be once again interpreting things overall under the lens that others are out to get me.  And this means that everyday conversations escalate over and over again.  I have had 10x the conflicts during interactions with people lately, which is leading me to believe that people really do hate me, and deserve to hate me.  

That's a main thing here.  I feel despicable somehow.  I feel as if I believe 100% that if everyone in the world knew everything I believe, everything in my head, they could not possibly love me.  This was a problem I had a long time ago, and it led to discordant behavior.     When I believe this, I fall into the trap of manipulation and hatred.  I hate them deep down because I 'know' they don't love me for who I really am, and I also feel disingenuous because I know I am representing myself to them as something I am not so that they won't have me thrown in jail.  

This means that once again it feels impossible to truly connect to another human being.  

I usually consider myself to have a lot of insight into my illness, but somehow I seem to be unable to think through things the way I have been in order to overcome these types of thoughts as easily.  Right now, for example (and I can say this because I just 'cracked' and jumped back on the ecig today), I remember things I had been using to overcome thoughts like the above.  For example, I usually get past the whole feeling evil/despicable thing by reminding myself that I don't believe in morality, that everything is relative, and pretty much nothing that I do is wrong.  Though this may sound like a scary thing to believe, the net result is that I am a more loving human being, because I love myself fully again, hate nothing that I do, judge nothing that I do, and therefore don't resent others for 'pretending' to love an unlovable creature.

My husband started having constant intrusive thoughts about knives and car accidents almost 2 months ago. I am 27 weeks pregnant, we were married in October, and this is the first time he has lived outside of his parents' house or a dorm. So, lots of changes this year.

He was diagnosed originally with OCD, and the psychiatrist reassured us that he was not going to act on his extremely distressing thoughts of suicide, or harming me and the baby. He recently started a new job, which was extremely stressful. After the antipsychotic started dulling the intrusive thoughts, he started breaking down multiple times a day with panic attacks and sobbing, which is extremely uncharacteristic since he's pretty stoic.

Fast forward a few weeks, an SSRI was added to handle the depressive symptoms, an anticonvulsant added to combat the tremors from his antipsychotic, and then he starts having tactile and visual hallucinations. He gets into two fender benders in a week, of which he is confident that he subconsciously acted on his intrusive thoughts. He is afraid he might try to kill himself without meaning to. 

Doctor starts suspecting small complex siezure activity, so I had to monitor him 24/7 in our home. A few days later, he compulsively jumped in front of a car in a parking lot, without realizing what he was doing.

He admitted himself to a hospital for 5 days, during which time the doctor pulled him off all the medications because they suspected it may make him worse. Not surprisingly, he feels better and is released. They admitted him under the vague diagnosis of psychotic episode.

Right now we are taking a more cautious approach to his medication plan, slowly putting him on an atypical antipsychotic to try to get his severe intrusive thoughts and the hallucinations under control. He knows they are not real, has a strong grip on reality, but he talks about this (self-admittedly illogical) fear of death waiting for him. 

He sees shadows creeping towards him at night, fears Death (or something terrible) waiting in the dark. He's been keeping himself distracted by playing video games at night and crawling into bed at dawn. His hallucinations only seem to happen at night, and the intrusive thoughts and panic attacks are better some days, and worse on others. 

We both fear his psychiatrist may diagnose schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. His grandfather has paranoid schizophrenia and is a child predator, who needs to be constantly heavily medicated to avoid hurting himself and others. I think my husband is afraid of ending up in a medicated haze the rest of his life. I realize that's a common anxiety with most severe mental illnesses, and if the diagnosis comes down to schizophrenia, we will figure out a way to adapt. 

I'm not looking for any kind of diagnosis, just support and advice on how to help him while we try these different approaches by his medical caregivers. It's just difficult to watch my husband's illness get worse and not have a full picture of what exactly we are facing.

Can some of you share your experiences when you were first diagnosed? How does your support system help you out? What kinds of challenges do you face in your relationships? What advice do you have for support people (or caregivers) on how to balance your autonomy and self-advocacy with needing support.

And I think I'm starting to come to terms with it. I'm starting to see my paranoia about the professionals as paranoia. I'm starting to see my voices as hallucinations.

This all came about as I was getting really deep into suicidal thoughts due to the voices encouraging me to help them by killing myself.

I've just.... I've decided that I don't want to kill myself for them. I don't want to die at all. I know the story in my head - I have to kill myself to go to their dimension and save them from the big bad monster that's hurting them. And it's extremely personal as I've encountered this monster in this dimension before. But he's dead here.

And i know that sounds weird. And I think I'm more open now to the possibility that none of it is even real. Now, I feel really anxious writing that. I think right away ""It is real."" but I'm still more open than I was. I'm more open to trusting myself less when it comes to big theories about the 'verse. 

So I guess, here's me saying I believe I'm schizophrenic. I'm sick. I'm 22 and I've been hearing voice since last year in December and I'm sick. I'm torn. Going back and forth but I want to stop fighting everyone so hard because it really makes me struggle. 

I've been trying to prove my case about the other dimension and just arguing with people and trying to convince them killing myself is best for the 'verse and I'm so exhausted from trying so hard when I'm gonna lose anyways. Killing myself isn't the answer. It isn't best for anyone, and I don't want to do it. 

I want to help the voices I hear, but not like that. There has to be a safer way. My psychiatrist said it's by taking my meds, and maybe that's right. If they're gone because of the medication they won't be suffering anymore. I'd have saved them.

Just thought I'd share some progress with you guys, since I've gotten lots of support from this subreddit before. 

Thanks!","['dobj', 'pobj']",-1,neu_vader

What qualifies it as remission? My boyfriend is a paranoid sz with religious grandeur, he has stopped having psychotic episodes for about a month now, I think he occasionally still hears voices, however I believe the delusions aren't on the forefront of his mind. He is doing well! He was on 20mg of Zyprexa SL once at night (that he refuses to take). He has been off meds for about a month or so and he has gained energy, lost weight, and his negative symptoms are improving too-he's more talkative than before. It's odd he is doing so well, I was nervous when he told me he was going to stop taking meds. Anyways, he seems to be doing great. Any advice on remission is greatly appreciated. 


Edit: Thanks for responding to everyone who took the time to help me. I have been on and off with my boyfriend for 7 years. We started dating at 16 y/o and I met him before his Sz was active. We are 23 now and he lives with me, I want to be able to take good care of him. I often tell people that if he had developed cancer or diabetes I'd stay with him, so developing Sz is no different. They call it ""in sickness and in health"" for a reason :)",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

Please forgive me if anything I say sounds insensitive or ignorant. I do not know if this person is schizophrenic but if you read the story it seems likely he might be a paranoid schizophrenic or suffer some other mental illness. Hoping somebody can help shed light on the situation. 

BACKGROUND 

I live in a small building and know all my neighbors. 

One of my neighbors (Guy) does not work regularly and is in his apartment all the time. He keeps to himself mostly but is really friendly and we have small talk whenever we see each other. He smokes a lot of weed, and maybe other stuff on occasion. 

NIGHT # 1

A few weeks ago, I talked to Guy one night and he seemed extra friendly. Afterwards he texted me saying he could hear me talking about him (I was not talking to anybody). 

MORNING # 1 

Next morning he calls about how somebody kept him up all night with music and chanting and when they left in the morning he heard them talking about him and how they wanted to cleanse his soul. He accused one of our other neighbors but it turns out he was out of town. He made the landlord come open his apartment to make sure nobody broke in. He had recordings on his phone of the noise. Nobody could hear anything on the recordings and nobody heard any of this music etc the night before. 

He asked me if he was schizophrenic and hearing things. I told him he might be hearing things bc I didn't have the conversation the night before that he had texted me about. He admitted he hadn't slept much for the past few days and he was really stressed. He also mentioned taking this hallucinogenic drug (ayahuasca) a few weeks ago for the second time. He wondered if that could have triggered something. Anyway I told him he should get some rest and I was worried. 

After that throughout the day he would catch me outside and ask me to listen to recordings but it was just white noise. I told him again to get some rest. I went to dinner that night and he started texting me accusing me of talking about him to neighbors and all this other stuff. I texted him back saying I have no idea what he's talking about and to please get some rest. He continued to text me asking why I was lying, why I hated him now, all these texts which I never responded to. He also called and left a rambling voicemail where he sounds drunk. 

NIGHT # 2

Anyway I go home and go to sleep that night. I wake up with the police coming to my house at 4am because Guy called them saying I committed a murder or something. I showed the police all the texts Guy had sent me and explained I thought he was having a psychotic break of some sort. The police said there was nothing they could do if Guy had not threatened me. I could get a restraining order but I'd have to go to court for that.  The police told him not to contact me again. 

It turns out he also had been calling other neighbors and my landlord freaking out about me trying to kill him or threatening him or something. He sent a text after the police left to some of my neighbors about how I somehow tricked the police and got out of jail. 

MORNING # 3

The next morning I called the non emergency line to tell them what happened. The police kind of said the same thing and said they see this all the time and didn't get a vibe from him that he would be dangerous or hurt me. They talked to him again and urged him to get help and not to contact me. They also told me not to contact him. My landlord was also angry and threatened to evict him but then said he just has a drinking problem and is giving him one more chance before he evicts him. 

TODAY 

Everybody in my building is pretty concerned about him now but it is a delicate matter and we do not know how to broach it or if it is even our place. Its been pretty quiet in our building and I feel like most of my other neighbors are just trying to put it behind us and hope for the best. I know they are probably curious or concerned but maybe do not feel as unsafe as I do (since I was the focus of his delusions). They kind of say well he looks normal now so I think it's fine. 

The past two nights I've heard him talking loudly around 1-3 am. Last night he sounded kinda angry and I heard things slamming in his apartment. 

MY QUESTIONS 

My worry is if this is just a calm before another storm.  If he has undiagnosed mental illness and is not getting proper treatment, is not on medications, and is self medicating (with alcohol, drugs, etc) then is this just a disaster waiting to happen? 

Am I in danger? What should I do? What should I look out for? 

Or am I making too big of a deal out of this and need to relax? 

What is the best way to deal with this? I wish I could know if he's getting treatment or what's going on but I understand that's not really my business. At the same time if he's having an episode and it puts me in danger in any way then it sort of is my business? 

I know this was a long story and maybe too many details but wanted to be thorough so people can advise accordingly. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Recently, in the past 3 years I have went through a lot of depression, anxiety, and traumatic experiences. I totaled my car and almost died, lost my job, and lost most of my friends. I've always had bad anxiety since highschool. In high school I was sexually abused by a close family friend for about four years. Anyway, so I have some reasons why I have anxiety or why it makes sense that I can be paranoid about a lot of things.
But recently my anxiety has gotten much worse, I can't sleep right (weird fear of the dark, that something is watching me, if I open my eyes it will see me and do something), sometimes during the day I get the feeling that I am being watched. I even have it in my head their is an Indian spirit in my bathroom mirror. I only see it at night if the bathroom light isn't on. Started out in the corner of my eye. The other morning I was walking home from a friends at like 6 am, and I felt like someone was following me. I turned around and I saw a whitish pale figure like 15 feet behind me following me. I ran a little, turned back around and she was chasing me. When I got home, I looked back and nothing was there. 
Sometimes I see what looks like flies or nats pass through my field of vision really fast. This has happened a lot the past week. But no one else claims they see them in the room.
Last thing, sometimes I get really bad thoughts in my head. Like violent shit. I'm not a violent person at all. It's stuff I would NEVER think of saying or doing. I feel horrible the thought somehow even went through my head. Like someone told me to strangle my mother's dog, kick my cat, kill myself, slit my wrists ect.
This is the scariest part of it. I'm scared it is going to get worse and if I dont get put on some sort of medication I am going to start seeing full on hallucinations every day. 

If anyone has any idea what this could be, or if it could be schizophrenia please help me out. I don't have insurance so I'm not sure how to even go about going to a doctor.",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

Then, I had a series of euphoric episodes during which I worked on overly ambitious and unrealistic goals, such as overthrowing the Putin regime, working on the creation of a new social and economic system, trying to learn *all* of economics on my own etc. My mind raced and I couldn't sleep. Gradually, I started believing that I had been poisoned by the Putin regime for trying to overthrow it, because they found out my posts about it on the Internet and sent agents to poison me. Then, this idea gradually disappeared. 
I never believed that idea 100%, it was 51% at most.


I talked about it to my psychologist, but I modified the story slightly as I feared the (imaginary) legal repercussions for trying to overthrow the Putin regime (although, I could get hospitalized involuntary for potentially being a danger to others - I planned to amass weapons and recruit others to target government and military targets and such). I said that me and my friend pretended to be anti-Russian terrorists on a Russian forum, and that I feared that now the Putin regime waned to get rid of me. A diagnosis of psychosis NOS followed.


This was followed by a period of relative stability, both in terms of mood and in terms of psychosis. Until I started feeling particularly depressed and suicidal, and wanted to see a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist diagnosed me with paranoid schizophrenia during our first appointment, not based on what I told him, but based on the psychologist's observations. He didn't tell me of my diagnosis (well, until much later), but I saw it in my mental health folder.



I was prescribed Zyprexa which I took at first, then refuse to take, then took again for some time, but I stopped as I feared having the neuroleptic malignant syndrome when I had a fever - it turned out to be sinusitis. 

Anyway, even if I didn't abruptly stop taking it, I would've stopped anyway because my mother told my GP that I had no delusions nor hallucinations and asked the GP to gradually take me off the anti-psychotic, which he accepted - he prescribed me to take a reduced dose for 1 month, and then stop taking it altogether.


I remained without medication for about 8 months since the diagnosis was made. My grades abruptly declined, as I entered what could be called a mixed episode - my thoughts raced, I couldn't sleep, and yet, I felt very depressed and suicidal. I experienced high levels of stress around others which was unbearable during that episode, and I dropped out of high school. This episode lasted for about 4 months, until I had a depressive episode, and then, an euphoric episode during which my mind raced, I laughed at virtually everything, didn't sleep, wrote 25-page-long letters to my psychiatrist, was particularly cheerful and motivated, wanted to start working a full-time job without a high school diploma, etc. I also heard my name being called out of nowhere/out of background noise every few seconds, and experienced mild visual hallucination - I saw a floating rectangle shadow (the hallucinations stopped after the episode and never returned, though). At this point, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by another psychiatrist, and was prescribed an anti-depressant as I had a bout of depression as well.



I started having major psychotic symptoms, such as delusions of grandeur - I believed I was some kind of a genius who would save the world with his ideas, and that my every action was perfectly rational. I then started believing that my plan to dominate the world via amassing massive wealth with credit card fraud and creating a word wide union of cyber-mafia I would control was perfectly rational. I started copying speeches from The Matrix and reciting them on my balcony, which worried my mother a lot. That's when I realized that I couldn't speak anymore except for a few speeches from The Matrix or just a 1-2 word phrases. I ran around the house at 4 AM, called my psychiatrist several times and left him The Matrix voicemails, etc.


Then, this euphoria progressed, and I went from being cheerful to having a catatonic episode - being stuck in my own bed, unable to initiate voluntary movement most of the time. Sometimes I stood up, went to the bathroom (to brush my teeth), remained in the bathroom for a few hours, then went back, stood in front of my bed for a few hours, and went back to my bed. I usually didn't speak more than a few words or one word at a time, as I was unable to open my mouth most of the time. Sometimes though, I had major flights of ideas and pressured speech, during which I spoke a lot, but I still remained stuck in my bed.
This catatonic episode lasted for about a week or so, and then it stopped on its own.


Then, my psychosis went from stopping to progressing immensely. I started believing that I imitated all the mental illness I thought I had, and that that imitation was perfectly rational with the goal of personal gain, and that I learned that from learning lots of mathematics (such as decision theory and game theory, which is exactly about that) and logic (I really did learn a lot of mathematics, though).


I then started thinking that the government found out about my amazing gift through my psychiatrist and my Internet history, and now used the TV, government agents, various stalking methods, Google queries, etc. to recondition me into working for them. I thought the TV sent me messages on what kind of ideas I should work on, that when I googled something, the result was immediately generated by a government algorithm to communicate with me/recondition me, etc. I thought I could communicate with the government via Google. I then started thinking that my entire town was isolated because of me and the remaining citizens in it were forced to work for reconditioning me, and that the entire world observed me and what I typed on Google. I thought I was on top of the word, that I could do anything shamelessly and without judgment, that I could get any girl I want because they work for the government project dedicated to helping me, etc.
At this point I hadn't sleep and hadn't eaten for days - I was dizzy because of this, but I didn't care.


Then, my parents decided to bring me back to high school, so they found a private high school in another town, got me in the car, and went with me there. I thought I was going to receive the Nobel Prize there for my work, and that all the people and cars around me were controlled in such a way as to make me act in a certain manner, which was calculated by the world's best mathematicians. I thought that the radio in the car talked about things relevant to me. They talked about North Korea, and I thought they got my message about no nation or leader being evil, and that social conditions create the evil. I thought my discovery was genial and that the people cheered about it as they observed me. Then, as I got out of my car, I started singing some North Korean propaganda song and clapping my hands, and I thought that I could control everything around me by mere movement, so I laughed hysterically. I went around, my eyes focused on the plate numbers of the cars and the ads which I thought were placed there by the government. I ""scanned"" for information in order to make perfectly rational decisions. I thought I was messing with the government and they weren't able to handle it, and that I wasted a ton of their resources. I said ""You have to suffer in order to set others free."" (this was in a context of severe dehydration, hunger, and sleep deprivation). 


But then, I thought that I was locked in a ""termination"" algorithm which I set myself due to recently more depressed mood I was experiencing, and that I was going to kill myself through starvation and dehydration by acting through my algorithm of movement, which I thought I couldn't get out of.


My mood was still euphoric but had some depressive qualities to it as well. I asked my parents to go home, and we went home. As we arrived home I thought that the government wanted to poison me because of the fact that I wasted so much of their resources, and that when I went on the Internet it was generating false and mocking pages, and that in reality I was disconnected from the Internet.


At this point, I screamed ""THE CIA WANTS TO POISON ME"", ""THEY WANT TO POISON ME!"", which is when my parents actually noticed that I was psychotic. They asked whether any voiced told me this and I said ""NO, THEY JUST WANT TO POISON ME!"".

The euphoric episode I had started having more and more depressive qualities to it, and my behavior became more and more agitated. I insulted my mother and screamed and her because I thought she worked for the government and tried to poison me, and she feared for her life, to the point where she had to call the cops. The cops arrived and asked me whether everything was alright and I said ""I was just scanning for information on my balcony."" and they said ""Yeah, alright."". I talked to them, and they asked for the name of my GP which I told them, and they went to my GP to get a redirection to the mental hospital. They were unable to obtain it, so my mother called a private doctor so that he would visit us at home, and then the cops left.


The doctor gave her a redirection for the mental hospital after she explained everything what happened, and left. I thought that the doctor was a cop disguised in a doctor for some reason, though. Probably because he wore a watch which was almost identical to mine, and it contributed to my delusion.


My dad arrived from work soon and we went to the mental hospital. Before that I asked for a closed-off room to work on my ideas on Google, and I thought my dream was coming true - the government assigned me an entire mental hospital for me to work on my ideas.

But as the hospitalization proceeded, I was more reluctant to accept it. I started lying to get out of it, but my efforts were futile. Then, I started accepting that I might be delusional and that I was being hospitalized, but as the doctor presented me the mental hospital in a sarcastic manner ""Here's your computer you can use whenever you want, and here's your TV."" I started believing that I was indeed assigned a mental hospital to work inside on my great ideas. I was told that I would be put on a powerful tranquilizer at first and then anti-psychotics. I was injected with powerful tranquilizers, but I still didn't sleep at night. I was unable to move due to the tranquilizers' effect, had dry mouth, and so on.


Then, as I heard something on the TV about politics, I thought it was time to get out of the hospital and show myself to others. I got out of the hospital and started walking out of it, still under the tranquilizer's effect. Then eventually I was brought back on the hospital's car - I accepted it voluntarily, as I was too tired to walk further.


Then, I escaped again, but was too disoriented and tired to find the exit, so I went back.


Time went by and my psychosis gradually stopped over the course of the month. In the aftermath, I had lost 11 kg. I was taking the highest dose possible of a typical anti-psychotic called Clopixol - it was horrible, caused high lethargy, tiredness, and lots of secondary negative symptoms (basically, negative symptoms being indirectly caused by medication, due to tiredness, etc).


I never re-experienced psychosis since then and it's been over a year now. I'm 18 (19 in a month) years old now, go to the final year of high school full time, get rather good grades, and have a social life. My diagnosis was changed to ""60% certainty schizoaffective disorder and 40% certainty bipolar disorder"" as my new psychiatrist put it. This is exactly what I thought - I doubted the schizophrenia diagnosis because I had major mood swings, which excludes schizophrenia. I'm taking a new atypical anti-psychotic called Solian (Amisulpride) lower than the minimal dose prescribed during psychosis (200 mg) and an anti-depressant Paxil. I'm doing pretty well, and I'm planning to major in computer science and mathematics (it's a shared degree where I live). So far, apart for a mood swing this (2014) summer when I thought with 30% certainty that I could start my own anti-Putin guerrilla warfare movement and felt particularly cheerful, I remained symptom free. I made lots of friends, and spent a nice time with them. I'm much happier now than during the previous years, and my mental capacity went up as I started taking meds (I feared that it would drop and I would degenerate mentally) - this showed itself in the grades - I'm among the top of my class. So far, life is good.

The only reason why I continue to visit this doctor is because he RX's me amphetamine.

Has anyone felt this way or been diagnosed by one doctor and then the other one is in complete disagreement with the other?

Well here in Lebanon, I pay about 20$ for a month's worth of risperdal 2mg (and most other second generation drugs cost about the same). And abilify 10mg costs me less than 150$ for a month's worth. 

I don't see where do the figures from the article come from. If risperdal or any other second generation drug costs as much in america as it does in lebanon the guy would have been put on second generation drug.

Another thing, in Lebanon the government doesn't subsidise the price of medication and I am not talking about generics. So these are the international prices for the meds.

Now, at the age of 24, it is getting strong again.

Now my question. I can deal with the episodes and the symptoms. Quite frankly it fascinates me and I learn from it. I dont want to get rid of the symptoms, but I just want them to ease up a little bit to make it easier for me to het through a day at work.

I was just diagnosed with schizophrenia. My symptoms are visual and auditory hallucinations, skin feelings that aren't there, odd smells and tastes, delusions and general anxiety about all of that. I also get this thing where my brain just ""stops"", mid thought or sentence, and I lose all short term memory and my head empties in an instant. It is like my brain just leaves and I can't find the ""spot"" where I was at. My therapist called it thought-blocking, but I don't know much about why it happens. Forgive me for this, I used to think I was just psychic or I was a new form of God..right now that sounds ridiculous though. My fiancé says I often talk gibberish or refer to something that doesn't make sense and that scares the hell out of me. Recently I was convinced that my friend was using me as a slave for her jewelry business in California and she had bugged my electronics..well I still sort of believe that from time to time but right now it sounds like bullshit. I make jewelry, and when she asks me about it the paranoia comes back and I hate it.


I've been like this for 20 years. I found the courage to tell my therapist recently that this ""inner monologue"" as I called it was getting nasty and hard to ignore. Come to find out it isn't thoughts, but voices. She picked up on it when I told her they often argue with one another, call me a whore, tell me to shut up, to stick pins in my hands, and they also wake me up when I am about to fall asleep, mostly by shouting things that don't make sense or are very funny. I thought they were thoughts, I thought everyone had that angel/devil thing going on..

To shorten this, in my teen years I tried all available antipsychotic meds with none helping. (I guess it was suspected but they never told me why these particular meds were being tried) Psychiatric medications and I do not mix well at all; I have bona fide allergic reactions to many and the rest give me severe side effects, I've had stevens-Johnson syndrome already, and some leave me completely unable to walk or speak. I intend to visit a psychiatrist very soon for this despite knowing there aren't any great med options for me. It just seems like something that is the next step. The neurologist wont see me anymore, so that is what I am left with. 

So I guess I am asking, what works for you? Is there a trick you use to get past a bad episode or whatever you call it? Loud music seems to drown out the voices but not always, and my hearing is suffering for it.. How do you comfort yourself? How am I supposed to get to sleep? I am told by my family doctor that melatonin is very bad for this condition. How do you remember what you are saying or focusing on when your brain ""stops""? What do I do now??

Though, my years having taken medication, having periods of being institutionalised have given me, if anything, a very cynical view of some ways of handling the mentally ill (as most here could probably agree). For more background, I'm an American but immigrated to New Zealand and I see glaring failures in the system here that have effected me personally. So, I'm writing this out because perhaps I have a different expectation or I'm off the mark totally. 

My recent ex, who is from NZ, is like me in that he is highly functioning, and that sometimes sucks when you're trying to tell a doctor that you are truly in need of help but they can't see it because you're presenting ""too well"". He's never gotten any kind of diagnosis other than he has a personality disorder, but never fitting any criteria or enough that he could get any real help. Instead he has been sent off for psychotherapy, which helps but IMHO does not address certain issues that seem to never resolve rather repeat in horrible circles. I'm not saying *he's* got sz but with my own experience I see when something looks totally dangerous - and this kind of thinking is dangerous. It holds no responsibility to reality, rather just a wing and prayer that some unknown is determining actions for you. If you have always lived like this you would trust it to a certain extent even if you know it's damaging, he feels like he has no free will rather this is pointing him towards right and wrong. He knows that his thinking is ""warped""

The system here is different than in the US, and I told him several times that if he were to have tried for help there he might have had a different outcome. The tl;dr is that he bases actions in reality (such as work or relationships) on dreams he has or feelings (such as pricking in his arms, or psychosomatic symptoms like exzema) in a way that he uses them as his basis for doing things like breaking up with me, or not finishing work, etc. This week he broke up with me because he had a dream that he interpreted (in a Jungian way...don't even get me started down that road) on top of negative feelings in certain parts of his body (like arms) when I touched him or he experiences my presence as an inner invasive feeling like taking heroin. All mixed together he kind of falls apart.  There are also more issues that *are* better dealt with in therapy such as not trusting  It's always arbitrary, and some dreams are interpreted while others aren't and there is never any clear indication of which should be other than they ""feel"" or appear as ""archetypal"" or something. Coming from my own experience it is unusual thought patterns which do in fact create disruption or a loss of support in his life, in reality, which he struggles to live in.

When this stuff goes on I say, no this is crazy, and go downtown looking for help, to see a psychiatrist while he was in this acute state so they could *see* that he was kind of unglued. Instead they told us to ring a crisis team and they would determine if he needed help. Speaking with them they said it sounds like he isn't going to hurt himself or others so it is not a crisis. This is why he never gets help, when he is in the middle of a kind of delsional state, waiting three weeks to see a doctor *isn't helpful* but to see one right away would require that he's suicidal. What do? His therapist is amazing, however again there is nothing in terms of addressing his thoughts when they are happening. It's kind of heartbreaking.

He certainly should have gotten help years ago. This hasn't been without effort, without knowing that there is a correlation between having a wrecked life and basing decisions off arbitrary decisions/dreams/feeling-states. Not that they aren't *real* but when the receiver is the sole interpreter of those feelings, having a background in trauma, how does he know he's ""interpreting"" them ""correctly"" or that they need an action taken at all? Unknown. Has anyone else done something or experienced something similar? What have your experiences been?

I've read a book recently (if anyone is interested in the NZ mental health system) called [Madness Made Me](http://www.amazon.com/Madness-Made-Me-Mary-OHagan/dp/0473279800/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432927574&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=madness+made+me) and it's not anything I feel like I don't know, perhaps there is no help for something like what he's experiencing but is it fair to let someone live like that because it's deemed his personality? It's prevented him from living a stable life, and he knows no better than to think in this kind of logic. Do people who only present as crazy deserve immediate help?",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

I've been hospitalized 5 times. In my history I've dealt with psychosis that involved delusions, hallucinations, extreme loss of daily function, paranoia, confusion, etc. I lost big chunks of memory or would have strange 'false' memories of people saying negative things to me, and then them deny it later on. Sometimes I would get so confused I couldn't count, and my paranoia almost lost me my job many many times.

My usual state of being is usually severe depression, and over the years less and less simple daily function. I've had to stop working. I have trouble remembering to eat, take medication, shower, anything. My cognitive abilities have declined over this short amount of time, and my daily thoughts are bombarded with intrusive thoughts and images, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive behaviors. Apparently I have inappropriate responses to many things, such as sexual reactions to many quite violent and uncomfortable images. I've also been very violent in the past and it's something I've spent a LOT of time working on controlling. My thoughts frequently feel so disconnected, and I have an ongoing desire to figure out where they come from. From my nightmares, to my intrusive images and thoughts, to various other visions - they are NOT mine. I did not create them. 


Anyway, that's just a bit of an overview of the worst of it. My daily life, while impaired, still involves a lot of good things. I don't have much of a social life anymore, it's so difficult to interact with my closest friends that I've just slowly avoided them all, it takes SO much energy trying to interact. I don't want them to see how depressed and confused I am. I have a boyfriend and we have a good time together, although I do have a bit of an opiate abuse issue that makes being a ""person"" a lot easier. Most people that I see on a daily basis get a big smile and very friendly conversation from me, I want to be a pleasant person, but it takes a lot of energy being a person. In the past my boss at my job was constantly complaining about my blank stare, inability to respond, etc. My mother has seen it too, I have had to teach her over the years that if I look distant it isn't because I'm angry or don't care, I just don't realize I'm doing it.


Anyway, I started at a new community mental health facility. We did intake and I've spent a few months seeing a therapist there on a weekly basis. They've decided that I must not be schizophrenic because I haven't displayed psychosis or obvious negative symptoms while they see me there. While I love the idea of being able to distance myself from the diagnosis of schizophrenia, it concerns me that they might be interpreting this incorrectly. Considering I only see my therapist once a week for 30 minutes, it's quite easy to put on my social face and talk with her. The actual psychiatrist has never seen me for more than 10 minutes at a time, about 4 different times. I've met some very high functioning schizophrenics in my life, so I'm not sure why these doctors think it isn't a possibility considering my past and family history. They've literally said that my past symptoms and experiences aren't relevant, only what's happening RIGHT now. (Anyone who has been through psychosis knows that's a bit demeaning, as it's perfectly reasonable to take those times into consideration and fear that they may happen again).

In the past, I've had great success taking the medication Tegretol, but now they refuse to prescribe it to me because I'm not schizophrenic. My daily life is so broken, even with antidepressants, anxiety, and focus related medications. I understand that tegretol has its risks, but I just want to try it again. The only reason I stopped before was losing my insurance and not being able to see that old doctor again.


Have any of you here had trouble with new mental health professionals doubting your diagnosis? Am I really so alone in being able to function and interact with people, despite having many negative symptoms that affect me?
As for now they say I've got obsessive compulsive disorder and severe depression (and that depression is what caused my psychotic episodes). 

I'm so sorry this is so long! Thank you for any remarks.

*[EDIT] If I tell them that I use opiates daily (which is the biggest factor in being able to act sociable more easily) they will kick me out of the program with no medication, and they're the only place here with a sliding scale I can afford.*

**TL;DR: My life is crippled by my mental illness. Many of my symptoms indicate schizophrenia, which is what I've been treated for in the past, but my new community mental health center doctor doesn't believe it could be schizophrenia because she hasn't personally witnessed negative symptoms in the 15-30 minutes we spend together. They won't let me use a medication that has been successful in the past because of this. I also have to wonder if I WAS misdiagnosed in the past and they're right, because I am capable of some decent function**","['dobj', 'dobj']",-1,neu_vader

13. Always have that fear you might go back to the hospital or end up in a group home/homeless
14. Fear of dying early 
15. etc.

So the last two month's I've been feeling better in terms of psychosis. But I always get down because of my disability. How come I can solve and understand math problems 99% or more of the world's population can't do, but I can't be independent? I hate living at home and living off the government. I just want to make enough money so I can have a small apartment and maybe have a girlfriend someday. 

We always hear that people can be successful with schizophrenia. We've heard that doctors have it, we've heard about Elyn Saks. But I feel like those are outliers. 

Is anyone here independent? 
Does anyone enjoy life, even a little?
Anyone have a girlfriend?
Anyone over the psychosis/delusions?
Anyone enjoy what they do for a career?
Anyone end up going back to college?

I just need some hope. My psychologist tries to give me the blunt reality and it ends up depressing me. He wants me to finish my degree asap. I just don't feel like I'm ready. I keep telling him I'll go back in 1-2 years...and he just doesn't buy it. 

Thanks,",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

As of a few months ago, I stopped taking the medication regularly as my depression was easing off. Then something odd happened. I started seeing shadow people out of the corner of my eye.

I'm not sure how to talk about this or where to begin or even what I'm asking... 

About me: 
I'm 23 now, and I've been battling depression since I was 16. I have not had any treatment, though I visited a psychiatrist twice but it was rubbish - was just given pills (lexapro I think it was). I was on for 2 months, age 21, before I saw how my mum was reacting to me being treated and I decided to stop, as treatment is expenisve and she was expecting me to be cured already, like when you take antibiotics when you're sick. I've been pretending with my family that everything's okay now. I'm holding it together and I'm functional etc, most people would never guess I'm depressed. 

About Guy X:
My age. He was diagnosed with ADHD when he was young and schizophrenia in his teens, though I'm not exactly sure when. He was regularly seeing a psychiatrist around age 16-20 but he stopped taking his medication at around 17. He regularly hears voices or sees visual hallucinations but has somewhat accepted them, as ghosts or spirits or otherworldly things beyond normal perception. He is a exceptionally gifted person - genius even. He can understand and learn all sorts of things so easily, like physics and chemistry or anything, and he is one of the most amazing musicians ever, no exaggeration.

About Us:
We were high school sweethearts, first loves, and we met at 17 but we broke up at 19 and we stayed incredibly close. There's always been leftover feelings between us. However, when we met at 17, he was already beginning to experiment with drugs, which he was using in part, recreationally, but also to cope with his ADHD and schizophrenia. So when we got together I began experimenting with drugs too. At first it was mostly weed, and we'd use K and E as party drugs. He was, and is, a very heavy weed smoker. 

After we broke up, we both went our separate ways and saw different people but we were both in each others lives. Not through each other, our drug use began to expand. He's pretty much done everything there is to abuse, and will use a cocktail of them regularly (particularly weed and meth), and I am now using meth, valium and xanax on quite heavy basis, with other party drugs now and then.

Just a few weeks ago I went through a very bad depressive spell, which further encouraged my drug use (especially meth), to a point where I was getting psychotic. He then stepped back into my life and pretty much saved me. I know saying this is just fooling ourselves, but we've been keeping each other's drug use in check over the past few weeks. We have talked and we've acknowledged strong feelings for each other but we don't know where to go from here. I've always known I loved him, so I'm not surprised with how I feel.

After these talks I started looking up more about schizophrenia, not because he's been acting up or anything - like I said, he's started to accept the hallucinations as just things that are there, and function with them around. I just wanted to know what he was experiencing. Watching the documentary Schizophrenia: Stolen Minds, Stolen Lives scared me so much - it's like looking at a mirror of him and what could happen to him. I came to this thread because I wanted to know more about what I could do to help, how to convince him to get to treatment, or anything... There was this video posted just a little bit below in the thread about Schizophrenia VS Depression which just blew me out of the water...

What I'm trying to say is... Should I just leave him? Am I aggravating his problem? Will he get worse? How fast will the drugs, especially meth, cause him to to sink? I've seen the meth bring us both to incredibly dark pits of addiction a few years ago, though we aren't at that place now. I've seen the drugs tear at both our minds, and now I guess we're relatively normal... 

I don't know if I'm the right person to be helping... I don't want to weigh him down and both of us just end up this self-destructive whirlpool. I think I should just cut ties with him.

We are both trying to address our drug abuse problems by trying to 'cut down' (that is a cop out, but neither of us knows how else we can go about it). I don't know if I need to be seeking help for us or anything - I'm sorry this post is all over the place, things are very overwhelming at the moment. I'm not sure what I'm asking for haha... Help?

I don't know whether to go off or not. I'm starting to think about it, but I have plans to live on my own in February. Plans to start my own business. I can't get sick again like I was. I have to be healthy.

Can I be healthy and still hear my voices? I can't control what the voices say, so maybe not. They've instructed me to hurt myself before. 

I feel stronger now. Like if I were to hear them again it'd be a good thing, like I can handle it better than before. 

I felt so special, like a superhero. I was for them. I was supposed to save them. 

I keep thinking I'm such a failure. I failed them. Left them. Left them to suffer so I could get some peace. Don't they deserve some? 

I wanna go off my meds. I wanna be sure. I wanna KNOW what's real. 

I keep seeing things that indicate I'm in a fake reality. Like.. lights flashing where they shouldn't be, around nature, like it's all an illusion, a lie.

* **1 month ago**, the neighbors were going around the neighborhood with a megaphone saying that my little brother smokes pot (we think this is real, we've had problems with our neighbor in the past and someone else in the neighborhood heard it too) At this point we believe she started losing sleep. Getting only 3-6 hours a night.

* **3 weeks ago**, she overheard the neighbor saying he was going to plant marijuana in our yard (again, may or may not be true, but less evidence of it here)   

* **2.5 weeks ago**, **This is where it starts** she was VERY spacy. She would take 10 seconds to respond to a question, she'd stare off to a wall, and just sit in a chair staring into space (perhaps thinking?) for 30+ minutes (I don't know if it was 30 minutes or 6 hours, I don't come out of my room for long periods of time while napping/gaming).

* **2 weeks ago**, she was hospitalized because she thought the neighbors were hypnotizing us and was *very slightly* hearing voices from the air vents that were playing 'recordings' of something. It was the same messages over and over. Only certain vents though. At this point, I thought it was just a lot of stress. Her mother had died a month before, I am very very depressed, my little brother has been contemplating dropping out of school, my dad is an asshole, I've been wanting to take time away from school, her work has a lot of drama, her brother is a drug addict trying to cash in on her dead mothers house, he's dying, our cousins are prostitutes and drug addicts, and the list goes (shortly) on. Personally, I've heard things that I *thought* were voices or people talking when I was high or everything else was really quiet, sometimes fans really CAN sound like the human voice a bit. So that's just what I thought it was.   

* **5 days ago**, she wasn't sure whether or not we were being 'cyber stalked', or whether we were being hypnotized by the vibrations from vents, from music, or by the next door neighbors. She didn't want to talk on the back porch because she thought the satellite dish might be listening in to us. I have to note that **Some of these delusions have some tie to reality**. I had mentioned earlier about NSA wiretapping which would lead her to believe the satellite dish thing. There was a piece on TV about a babymonitor being hacked and someone playing a voice out of it.   

* **3 days ago** She unplugged the phone and internet to prevent cyberstalking. She was constantly knocking on my door to tell me she loved me (6 times a day) and to look around my room for *something*

* **2 days ago** We have conflict, it's a blur to me because I was mostly at school and I had taken 10 sleeping pills in an attempt to try to get her to take 2 to help her sleep. (If you don't take 2, I'm going to take 2. Ok, 2 more. I'm going to keep going sort of thing) They were only melatonin and it added up to 30mg which is safe enough, but I digress. We can't figure out if she's been taking her medication she got from the hospital, if she's been taking her original medication, or if she even got medication from the hospital, they won't tell us. She's resistant to wanting to go to therapy, she's constantly lying about what she's doing, what she's thinking, and whether or not she's taken her medication.

* **Today** She knocked on my door and came in unwelcomed 6 times this morning, 2 of which the door was locked and she shimmied it open with a (butter) knife. She came in to tell me she loved me, and to cut off my room fan that was 'hypnotizing me'. We argued for about a total of 3 hours today, me trying to convince her that she needs help, her saying I'm acting strange (well yeah, because SHES acting strange). Absolutely no amount of reason breaks through to her, I try at least 10 different tactics. I act like she is. I Say that the painting that says ""A clean home is a happy home"" is trying to brainwash us into cleaning our home. I say it with 100% seriousness and wide-eyes, in the same manner that she does, and she calls me crazy. I say ""That's the exact same things you're saying about the fans, the satellite dish, the vents, Don't you think something's weird when you call me crazy and you're doing the same things?"". She does everything to avoid the answer and says ""One day you'll know"". She knocks on my door/tells me she loves me 21 times today. Breaking into my room unnannounced 9 of those times, 4 of them with the door locked. We go to a therapist that she sets up but she finds every excuse not to go. It's the wrong therapist (she set it up), it's a family christian counselor that she's trying to get to see me and my brother. We leave. More crazy antics/arguments until just now at 1:00 AM when she **CUTS THE POWER TO MY HOUSE**. She heard voices from my room's vibrations that were telling me to kill her (again, rooted in some sort of reality. I had argued earlier in the day that she needed help, what if she had delusions that she needed to kill me, what if she thought I was trying to hypnotize/kill her?).

I get fucking scared because this is straight shit from a horror movie. Psycho killer cuts power, gets a knife from the kitchen (where she was) and goes to town on some bitches. Thankfully that didn't happen, and I don't think she's a threat, but I'm still a bit worried considering she's shimmied my door open with a knife 4 times already today.

Anyway, my dad just changed the locks, we try to get her to take a sleeping pill (not sure if she just acted like she was) after she lied about already taking one (I counted). 


Help? Ideas on how to get an emergency psych tomorrow? Should we call the cops? Anything I can do to help her ease the delusions? No sort of logic seems to work, no matter what angle I take.



 ______

**Tl;dr** version.

* 1 year ago through today - I'm depressed
* 8 months - I halfway get kicked out, family drama
* 5 months ago through today - her work is stressful
* 5 months ago - My uncle is a drug addict
* 3 months ago - cousins get out of prison/rehab etc.
* various other stressful family drama
* 1.5 months ago, my mom's mom dies.

Here's where shit gets weird:

* 1 month ago neighbors 'go around the neighborhood with a megaphone saying my bro smokes pot' (may or may not be real)
* 3 weeks ago neighbors threaten to themselves loudly outdoors that they were going to plant pot in our yard (may or not be real)
* 2.5 weeks ago mom is very spacy. Doesn't respond to questions
* 2 weeks ago mom is hospitalized because tries to go to police station to report neighbors 'hypnotizing' her. Hears faint 'voices' from air vents
* 5 days ago, mom isn't sure whether or not she's being cyber stalked, hypnotized, hearing voices from air fans
* 3 days ago unplugs phone and internet to protect from cyber-stalking. Afraid of satellite dish hearing conversations
* 2 days ago, more serious delusions, more voices, more hypnotizing
* Today Just read original.

Overall, I'm incredibly surprised that it all happened within 2.5 weeks. Thought this stuff happened more slowly, or overnight from a mental 'break'. It hasn't been diagnosed, but everything that happens makes me think exactly that it is shizo.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

I am a 17 year old male, I am diagnosed with OCD, ADD, BDD, major depression, and what is possibly schizophrenia. I say possibly because schizophrenia is very hard to diagnose and a lot has gone in my life to make it difficult to diagnose. Ive been smoking weed, doing acid, mushrooms, various prescriptions, and MDMA since 15, cocaine since 16, and meth since about 5 months ago. I am currently 24 days clean of all hard drugs and 2 weeks sober from marijuana.


Ive had issues with my mental health for about two years now. It started off as me getting ""weird"" every once in a while and having minor hallucinations which I first thought was just severe HPPD. This slowly got worse, but mainly only when I smoked weed. Last March I had my first psychotic episode. I was with a couple girls and we were drinking cough syrup and doing various teenage things, eventually I had to leave as one of their moms was coming home soon so I went to a friends house to crash. The next morning I noticed my pupils were diamond shaped and I was still walking and talking kind of strange but I still went to school and went on with my day. Afterwards I went back to hang out with the two girls and we smoked a buttload of weed. My eyes got a strange look to them, everything these girls said sounded like it was some secret hidden insult to me, and I was hallucinating. I got panicked and made some lame excuse to leave. As soon as I left the house I could SWEAR TO GOD THERE WERE PEOPLE FOLLOWING ME, one of their moms must have called up her slightly scary gang connections on me, I knew it. At this point I was walking, talking, and thinking strangely, every person that drove by me was fucking staring at me and most likely a spy for the gangs after me. I rode the buses and dodged around neighborhoods for hours that day trying to lose my tails, but everyone was in on it, even all the old Asian men that ride the bus together everyday. That was horrifying. 


I've had anywhere from 8-15 psychotic episodes since then in varying degrees of intensity, but my worst was the one I had over the summer that led to me calling 911 and being placed in the teen psyche ward for 2 months and finally getting all my wonderful illnesses diagnosed, but I will get to that in a minute. After my first episode I slowly became intensely paranoid, everything people said was about me and usually some kind of insult, every action they did was trying to fuck with me, and everyone I loved was in some plot against me, and this was all before I got heavy into meth and while I was sober. Now, when I called 911, I thought my best friend kidnapped me, curbstomped me, and turned me into a hooker. I was insanely high on alcohol, weed, meth, coke, and Robitussin, and most likely about to overdose. I was in the hospital for two months and cycled through Risperidone and something else until I was finally put on Olanzapine, and given Cipralex for my depression and Concerta for ADD. These meds were nice and all but I hated how they made me feel. I was like a zombified energizer bunny, and I lied through my teeth every fucking day until I got out, and a week after I flushed all my pills down the sink and told everyone I was better. I was actually better though, for about two weeks. I still had to be very careful about my drug use because at this point Ive had so many episodes I can recognize all the signs and I knew that an episode could be triggered by taking too many bong rips. My paranoia is back but to a lesser degree, so I think it was mainly meth related. But now I cant hang out with people for a long amount of time because very slowly everything they say starts to turn into poison, And my hallucinations are getting worse everyday. At first I started seeing small black shapes fly around my peripheral, then a few of them were larger, then I started to be able to see them directly where I was looking, then I started seeing large shadowy figures run away as if they were hiding from me. I would look around and I could see one suddenly run off into the bathroom. The shadow figures have slowly been coming more often and getting closer/staying longer, and I'm really hoping that this sort of levels off. I've also been having a lot of weird episodes lately. Thinking becomes almost impossible, my speech is disjointed and awkward, I'll go into staring spells, I can't eat, and I cant remember what I was just about to type. But as well as weird episodes I'll also get randomly super pumped up and I'll usually pace around my house talking to myself for hours or work out and dance and sing or call up a dozen people just to say hey and that's not so bad. I'm afraid to tell any of this to people I know. I'm afraid of taking my meds again, I'm afraid of going back to the hospital, and I'm terrified of whats happening to me. I hate myself now. I miss the old, fun me. The guy that was always partying and fun to be around and who always had a beautiful girl around. Now I barely leave my house or talk to anyone, I'm about to fail all of my classes but thats not so bad because I'm about to be expelled because of my absences, and there was something else but I can't remember what that was either for the life of me. I don't know what to do anymore. I could use some help, please.

Also I just remembered I'm listening to rap right now and I wrote this

""Every night my inner demons seem to grow a little bolder,
Shadows in my mind steppin just a little closer,
What am I supposed to do when I'm gettin older?
Waste away and let my heart become a little colder.""",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

But now that I'm on such a low dose of meds the voices are back. Whispers. I wonder what I don't understand. I can't hear everything clearly. But I'm sitting in my room intently listening for words because I'm fucking crazy and they're everything. They're absolutely everything.

They're important. And I'm important. 

""Save us, please save us. You have to save us. You are our savior. Please come get us. Help us. He's hurting us"" 

I can't. I just can't. I want to scream and cut and scream some more and cry because I can't save them. I can't. They've told me time and time again how to save them.

""You have to kill yourself"" Damn do I want to right now. I want to save them. I want to be their hero. I want to mean something.

But I can't kill myself. I can't. That's not ever going to be a real option. I just can't. 

...but what if I do? I think I want to. I'm confused. I want to. But I can't. Just want to help them. Rescue them. I'm their savior.

The other dimension is calling me. Begging for my help. Begging. Screaming. Crying. I just sit and listen. 

I keep thinking I don't matter here. I don't matter anywhere but that other dimension where I can fight their evil God monster demon thing and destroy him and destroy myself and save them. 

Music. I've been listening to music today and I'm stupid because I think it means more than it does. 

The lyrics from ""The Night"" by Disturbed. 
""In a world beyond controlling
Are you going to deny the savior
In front of your eyes
Stare into the night
Power beyond containing
Are you going to remain a slave for
The rest of your life
Give into the night

This self discovery
Redemption taking hold of my mind
A serenade of haunting voices
Calling me away""

How can it be so accurate? I'm a savior of haunting voices. It was just a random song on Pandora. Am I crazy?

I want to cry but I have no emotions. I want to scream and freak out but I don't have it in me. I can only sit quietly and listen to the whispers. 

I have therapy tomorrow at 3:30. I won't kill myself until then. I need to speak with my therapist. He'll save me. He'll tell me what to do. 

Do I.. do I go to the hospital? Do I need to go? Am I sick? Do I just wait for my injection medicine while I have to listen to these whispers all alone? 

I don't care if I need to go to the hospital, I think it might bring some peace and order if I'm away for a week or so. It might be good. I kind of want to go. I like the nice people there. I like not feeling so insane because other people around are experiencing similar things and understand. They comfort. 

But I have school and a friends birthday is coming up. But I can miss those if I have to. But I guess I don't have to if I think I do because that means I'm well enough to see that I'm sick and I can just wait.

But on the other hand, I think I might hurt myself. It's quiet at the moment but once the whispers start up I just have no patience for them. I get so worried. I think that I must take action. I must do something to hurt myself to put them at ease, because my pain is their relief. 

Help me. I know I wrote  a lot but I hope someone reads it and gives me some guidance. Please help me. I don't know if I want to go to the hospital exactly but my mother agreed that if I'm not well tomorrow she'll take me, or maybe my therapist will hospitalize me after the display of my suicidal thoughts. I don't know. What do you think?

Just writing that gives me shivers. I've seen my therapist one time after that episode.. only because I got kicked out of school immediately after. I was doing good. I was working as a paid tutor on campus in the subject of my major.. I had a lot going for me. And I ruined it. I miss my therapist.

I'm so confused. I started Clozapine but that made me wet the bed every other night so I immediately got off and now I'm off meds completely, just for a week now.. my doctor thought that as safe I suppose or he wouldn't have done it. But tomorrow I go in and get an injection of Abilify, a safe choice, something I've been on that's done *okay*. 

I keep hearing sounds. Not voice, they're not back, not *yet*. But sounds. 

I don't know what I want. I have this *longing*. Not sure for what. I miss my therapist. But I miss.. the voices, the absolute sureness of something. Being a God. I miss being sure that I was an all-powerful being communicating with an alternate dimension. I fucking miss it. And these voices scratching at the back of my head trying to get in... 

I don't know if I'm just getting symptomatic or what. Maybe tomorrow is just the perfect day to start meds again. My brain is jumping around. 

I feel so *lonely*. The fuck is this? I feel.. like I'm going to have another episode and it scares me because I'm doing ok and I'm supposed to start my second chance at school again in February and see my nephew in January and it's the holidays and I have to do well for everyone and I'm so scared I'm fucking up AGAIN. 

I don't know what they're saying, the SOUNDS. sounds and sounds and sounds. Is it words? They're words but they don't mean anything. 

I've had enough. My family's had enough. Time and time again I have episodes. When does it end? S'pose with a bullet to me. Falling. Cutting. That's how it ends. That's just how it has to end, right? What else is there? Is there a life for someone like me? Symptomatic without meds that make me fat and slow. 

I'm working again. Perhaps that's the stresser. I've been doing 15 hours a week as a project manager. Somehow I can do that. Same company for almost 3 years now. I've just.. learned their ways and it's the only job I can do. But it's stressful.

Bee watching a lot of criminal minds, they talk about schizophrenics and I hate it. Why do we have to be the bad guys? Are we bad? Am I bad? :(

It was quite debilitating when it all started. She was afraid of taking a shower in our home for fear of being watched. My mom would have to take her to the change rooms of public swimming pools. She dropped out of public school to be home schooled because of social anxiety. She's seen a psychiatrist and has tried medication before she believed they would ultimately do more harm than good.

She had a good grasp of her illness when it all started. It took a couple months of convincing, but she started to realize it for what it is.  And things were more or less normal for a few years. She would still hear the voices day in day out but the topic would only come up on the odd occasion, partially due to her unwillingness to talk about it and us not wanting to make her uncomfortable. She would get bad temper swings and defensive whenever the topic was brought up. She did react better to me when I spoke to her of it, unlike my parents. Perhaps it's because we grew up together and experienced similar things...maybe she felt I could relate better.

Then things got rough again.  A year after we had both started University, she would exhibit really odd behavior.  Sometimes cursing under her breath at the dinner table. Other times kicking the back of my mom's driver seat as our mom would pick us up from Uni some days. She did all this with a extremely frustrated look on her face, as if she was battling something. You couldn't talk sense into her when these episodes happened. Other times my mom would tell me she would go into her master bedroom's change room, which happens to share the wall of my sister's room. My sister would make loud bangs on her desk, as if to let my mom know she's aware. My mom would cook in the kitchen downstairs, which also happens to be right below her room and at times she would stomp on the ground and lash her keyboard against the table. She's gone through a few keyboards/mouses because of this.

I managed to talk to her about this one day alone. She thinks my mom is somehow able to manipulate her feelings, thoughts, even facial expressions. I try my best to tell her this is a cause of her illness and to remember how real it all seemed when it started too. But shes gone this time, convinced that things are too coincidental.  That when my mom would go up to bring her a plate of food, she could feel the tension on the part of her wrist that you would use to hold a plate of food.

And then some days she would go down to have straight up arguments with my mom. Saying things like ""Don't give me that innocent look, you KNOW what you did"".  And obviously my mom is oblivious, helpless, and  shocked.  It's tough because on one hand I know her behavior is a symptom of her illness, but its so hard to forgive her or be calm about the situation in moments like this.
 
I'm not sure what to do anymore to help her.  She refuses anymore medical aid.  She graduated college last summer with a very high GPA, with a neuroscience major, hoping to be able to get into med school.  Academically she was set, but because of debilitating social issues, she couldn't get past the interview stage. She's been home over a year now, not doing much. But I think this bothers her. She knows being so dependent on my parents isn't right, and she wants to do something with her life. I've been away from home for over half a year now for an internship.  I just got a call from my mom a few weeks ago saying she wants to study Computer Science now (What I am doing), and that she wants to move half way across the country to go to another University. She's currently over 40k in debt, with another 60k if she does this. My parents are already helping her with the first, there's no way they could afford to help her with this. But shes stubborn and she wants to go, saying naive things like she can find a part time job when she hasn't worked a day her life, that she can take care of herself. But that's another story...

We chalked it up to immaturity and bad behavior, but he has recently been officially diagnosed and is (supposed to be) taking meds. I think he's pretty good about taking them.

Anyway, during his rough patch he didn't really talk to me for over a year. He is visiting now and his birthday is soon. 

He has major problems with attention and thought organization. He has a difficult time making decisions (so it's hard to just ask him if there is anything he wants). He mostly just plays his Gameboy.

But I go with my therapist's diagnosis which is schizophrenia since he knows me best and he's not the only one who's diagnosed me with that, I've been diagnosed with that mutiple times and schizoaffective just once recently. 

I've been through a lot in trying to accept it. More recently I've been.. in an episode. No voices, but strong delusions. I'm struggling with what to believe but I'm deciding that it's best to trust the people I know care about me, and that's my therapist. And he tells me I'm schizophrenic, he's absolutely sure of it. And that scares the crap out of me, but part of me knows he's right.

So i guess since I've been posting here a lot about my delusions and struggles, I thought I'd post something positive.

I'm just going to accept it. I have my doubts, my fears, but that's ok, I'm going to try and understand this thing. I miss my voices. I keep having second thoughts about medication, thinking I should quit taking them. 

I'm going to be getting a monthly injection of Abilify from now on, so no more pills. I hope it helps me better. And it's good because I can't suddenly stop taking my meds, I'll be getting a months supply in one shot so I can't hurt myself in that way.

The hardest thing is accepting that the voices are not people. They're me. Broken, shattered, mentally ill me. They may or may not have meaning. I haven't figured that out yet. I have this overwhelming confidence that the voices are living beings that need my help. But I'm doing my best to push that aside and believe what I don't.

I have to believe that I am stronger. I have to give myself the powerful feelings my voices give me in telling me that I'm a God. I'm not a God, but that doesn't mean I'm not strong. 

I feel vulnerable in accepting schizophrenia. It makes me feel less-than. Weak. Broken. 

I just want this to be easy and it isn't. I think maybe it's always going to be a struggle to accept this and believe in the people that care about me, because I know I wish they'd just believe me and my delusions. But I'm wrong. I'm paranoid and delusional and sick. And I need my medication. I need it so badly because if I don't take it I'm gone. 

The people in this subreddit have helped me so much. Thank you guys. I think I'm starting to get better.

I just stumbled upon this subreddit and I thought I could ask you guys for some help. My brother started developing schizophrenia about 5 or 6 years ago and it's unfortunately not getting better. His mental disorder has negatively influenced nearly every facet of his life. He's unemployed, isolating himself (doesn't talk to anyone outside of our family anymore) and his social skills are lacking. 

He's been taking meds for years but I'm not seeing any improvement in his health at all. The voices he's hearing won't stop belittling him and his mood swings are getting worse and worse. Some days he's having these manic highs and other days - when he starts hearing those voices again - he gets terribly depressive again. 

My question to you guys (as his sister and as someone who can't take seeing him like that anymore) is how can I help him at all? I don't fully understand schizophrenia yet which is why I've been trying to educate myself more, but it would be a lot more helpful to get advice from people who can relate and who struggle with schizophrenia themselves.

Today, I had to move my car out of the garage (someone was coming over to fix the garage), and as I was walking back to my house...M cuts me off with her CAR and blocks me. She BEGS for me to let her in because I have a ""Buddhist house that will protect her."" She is adamant that she is not crazy, but everyone in her life is just trying to get her. She kept saying how she doesn't need pills, and she just needs to get away.

Some of the things she said to me:

- There are protests and wars around the world because people are spreading rumors that she's a Jerusalem whore.

- Her parents beat her and throw her out onto the streets because they are racist against her boyfriend.

- She's scared of her boyfriend because she thinks he's a serial killer.

- Everyone keeps talking about her and spreading rumors about her. (When I ask who is talking about her, she just keeps saying ""they"" and ""everyone"")

- She said her family disappeared on her. I asked if they were just at work, and she says ""yeah, but they're gone.""

To my understanding, a person is not release from 5150 hold unless the patient agrees to treatment. M's parents don't seem to be enforcing the treatment and M confesses that she isn't taking her medication. It seems they just agreed to whatever so that M could go home.

Is there something that I can do? Or is this something that I should not get involved in?

I get Schneiderian delusions as follows: 

delusions of being controlled, mind reading, thought broadcasting, thought insertion, and thought withdrawal 

I had to use a text book because I could not articulate that better.  

This is mainly with people I would feel like they think something or sometimes with radio I hear something and it pertains to me. 



All bipolar I. I'm mixed-manic in mania. I started taking Perphenezine after being taken off of haldol in the pward 2 weeks ago. 


Then there's the hallucinations. Objects will be something else before I can tell what they are. Black formless shapes in the shadows or in the kitchen running around dog height. 

Does schizophrenia cause restlessness in the onset of a bad episode? I was restless for a good month where I lost 30 something pounds. My thoughts were racing and I was delusional in fact I cannot sit down and tell you the events of any specific day that month. So it's cooled down but now I get frequent hallucinations and delusional/magical thoughts. 

I'm only trying to learn this out. The docs say that if treatment fails they will send me to Rockland County Psych for long term which sounds like a sucky time (can't even smoke in there I think). 

Schizoaffective with manic bipolar? I'm pretty fucked because without the meds I will go get into lots of trouble but to quit treatment would forego any hospitalization. I just got out a 7 day stay at the local p-ward and they already sent mobile mental health to my house when I missed an appointment. I quit alcohol 4 days ago to help keep me out of trouble but even if the symptoms are under control I still want to find out what this all means.

So I did a search and looked at several previous posts and I found that many of us, like me, struggle with personal hygiene. 

I basically shower every 3+ days. I try to at least shower every Monday night (before my 3-day stretch of 12 hour shifts) and Friday (I also work every other Saturday). I try to shower for often,  it I don't for whatever reason. I also struggle to do my face routine (my acne is pretty heavy and I hate it. I had no problems doing an extensive routine while on medication,  but struggle with the basics off medication. And hygiene is literally my only problem) regularly. And I basically need an excuse to brush my teeth. 

Anyway, I found a product at target that has helped me a ton! 

It's called micellar water. It's a cleansing water. Micellar water (from what I understand) is basically water that has small oil droplets infused in it (and oil does clean! Look up oil cleansing method!) with other good stuff like moisturizers and niacinamide (very good for skin!). You just take a cotton pad and wipe it all over your face. No rinsing or anything! Just wipe and you're all clean!

The one I got is by the brand Simple and it was $6.99 in Indianapolis. Probably cheaper outside a large city. 

Simple products are found at Wal-Mart, target, cvs, walgreens, and other such places. 

It also gives me my excuse to brush my teeth! I brush my teeth while I wait for it to dry to put on an AHA. 

My face hygiene (still working on the showering...) has gotten SO MUCH BETTER!

* auditive hallucination (hospital sounds I've never heard before in my life)
* smelled like hospital medicine or something; when I approached people that probably had a sweet smelling perfume it would smell like lavender room spray
* made me freak out, I thought I was in a coma in reality

It stopped after 2 days. I did go to see a doctor and I was put on olanzapine for 3 weeks then I stopped.

I've had an other one that lasted 1 day(4 months later):

* smelled like incense, Initially I freaked out thinking I'm in hell, but I stopped thinking that because it would've caused some terrible paranoid decisions

Then it stopped (again, without taking medicine) then I went to see the doctor again, took zyprexa for 6 months till this day and I'm still taking it.

These were all caused, in my opinion, by the 5 xanax I took but the doctor says it can't do that to me.

The 2nd one was just a slight sensation without the vividness and brain sensations I had the first time. Very big difference between the 2 episodes.

My confidence got destroyed by a psychotic break. It was quite public and embarrassing. I have since moved to a different city and deleted my old Facebook account. I am also now on medication. 

The internet is full of horror stories about having relationships with bipolar people. I did find some questions about dating men with bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses in this sub. A lot of them had positive comments, but none of them were from women who actually dated bipolar men. The women who had dated bipolar men or knew someone who had dated a bipolar man were quite negative. AskMen has the same kind of pattern in threads about dating women with mental illnesses. 

The thought of approaching women makes me feel guilty because I would probably not tell them about my disorder unless things got serious. I could tell them earlier, but this would probably come off as weird and premature. I imagine that many of them would ditch me after I told them, which would be quite devastating. 

Most people think that dating bipolar people who are not on medication is an extremely bad idea, and I agree with this. I do not think I would date an unmedicated woman either, but I also know that a lot of the medications have quite severe side effects that could make the bipolar person emotionally unresponsive and dull, which is still better than being off meds but much worse than a neurotypical person. 

The only solution to this problem seems to be to date a woman who also has bipolar disorder or some other mental health problem, but I am having a hard time finding information on what bipolar women think of dating bipolar men, so I guess I will head over to BipolarReddit and ask them.

I (and my family) am just at a loss of how to help my brother. Some background - He was diagnosed 3 years ago at 25 and is having really bad delusions. He is convinced that there are 2 government agents that follow him everywhere. They are constantly trying to trick him into hurting himself or telling him that they will get him arrested for a crime he didn't commit and end up in prison / being tortured forever.  He has been hospitalized 4 times in the last 2 years and has made 2 pretty significant suicide attempts, but when asked about it, he claims that the gov did it, and not him. He refuses to take any help of any kind and truly doesn't believe that he's sick (he just has 'anxiety'). We've tried to get him to at least see a therapist for his 'anxiety', but he lies to them to get 'benzos' and then them when he feels like it (it seems like hes abusing them). He will not take any other medicine prescribed because he thinks it will give him cancer.  He's convinced that marijuana is the only medicine that will help him. He was able to get a medical card in another state and has accessed it, but each time he gets it, he thinks its tainted somehow. He thinks the gov has tried to poison him through it and he becomes increasingly despondent on how to 'cure himself with marijuana'. 

We were able to get him on SSI, but his delusions have gotten so bad recently, that he is refusing to do a call to verify his benefits and we can't afford that. He thinks it is all part of a conspiracy. We're really at a loss on what to do and currently have been trying to keep a family member around him at all times to make sure that he doesn't try to harm himself in anyway. 

Any advice on how to help him? We have tried hospitalization and he thinks it is all part of the conspiracy. Like the entire psych ward is just a front for a government lab that wants to perform tests on him. He knows how he's supposed to react though and has admitted to us that he lies (says hes not hearing voices, doesnt want to self harm ect) to be discharged. We tried to at least get him to take that long release medicine shot, but he has to consent and refuses to do it each time hes been hospitalized. Though he seems more stable in there, he quits taking his meds the day he gets out of the hospital. We've been able to get him to take his meds for about 3 whole weeks almost 2.5 years ago, and were lucky now to have him take them 2 days in a row when he actually agrees to get prescribed them. 

We've tried to get him therapy or in some kind of outpatient treatment, but he ""only has bad anxiety and doesn't need that"". he also admits that he will lie if we try and force him to go (for anxiety) which we have and has happened.
 
He refuses all medication except marijuana and occasionally a 'benzo', except every time he gets marijuana, he believes its been tampered with. (I think this is bc he doesn't get a desired result, so someone had to have messed with it) All other medications he's convinced will kill him quickly. We've tried to have tests to show him he is actually in great health, but he believes the results were ""switched out"" before they are given to us.  

We understand that all of this is very real to him and he is legit terrified that he will be killed by the government and it's really tragic to see him like that. We do everything we can to convince him that he is safe and try and make sure he has a support network, but we just don't know what to do. My mom and I attend NAMI meetings frequently and they do help, but I've had a hard time finding anyone who has dealt with something similar and I just don't know what to do.  We can see an episode coming on and hes been saying frequently that his only 2 options are to 'move out west' (where marijuana is legal) or kill himself. We are so worried that he will just disappear on us when he is alone. (Last time he went out west, he was hospitalized with a pretty close suicide attempt within 2 weeks).  We try and have someone with him at all times (we frame it as just hanging out) to make sure he can't do anything, but we're worried that he'll find a way. 

We are considering calling the police and getting him hospitalized again just to make sure that he is safe, but based on every other interaction with treatment, he'll lie to the drs and be released in a couple of weeks and the countdown begins until another episode happens. He also appears less and less trusting of us when we do get him in there. (he's stopped talking to one family member that called the cops on him and got him hospitalized. He's convinced they are a government agent now). He also can be violent (hes 6ft, 200lbs) when anyone tries to convince him what is happening isnt real. We go along with his delusions, but try and just convince him that he is safe so he stays calm.

We are at a complete loss of what to do. We have no history of this in any part of our families, so no one we know can really give us advice on how to take this on. It's so heartbreaking to see him because you know he is so tortured inside and all we want to do is help him get better. So what do we do??? Any advice would be greatly greatly greatly appreciated!!! (And thanks for reading!)

**TL;DR: My brother is schizophrenic and is having bad paranoid delusions. He's convinced the government is following him and will torture him. He thinks has anxiety and refuses all treatment and medications. My family is at a complete loss on how to help.**

When I had all the symptomes a few years ago, I went to two therapists, both said they weren´t capable of treating me and I should look for someone else. They mentioned though that what I have sounds like schizophrenia. The thrid therapist I saw wanted to send me to the hospital straight away, probably because I was at a point where I was damaging myself. On the other hand, I can seem extremely healthy and totally block out all schizophrenic symptomes when talking about my conditions, which is why when that last therapist called my mom to tell her she should make sure I get into a clinic, my mom thought that woman was totally exeggerating. She couldn´t even grasp how someone could ever say I was schizophrenic.

Anyway, after that, I never talked about these sypmtomes again and talked about anxiety, depression and things like that, I got medication and actually, even though I wasn´t treated for it, my schizophrenic sympotomes became much weaker. I went from being too paranoid to eat or go out, by being delusional, having visual and audio hallucinations to having some occasional paranoid or delusional thoughts, but nothing that crippled me too much. I also believe it became much better because I was generally less stressed.
Now my life has been more stressful lately and things are starting to become really difficult again. I´ve had a hard time eating lately because I get the idea that it´ll cause my situation getting worse, like there are demons controlling fate or something. Of course, I´m making all the wrong connections so if I sit down to eat and there is a thunderstorm starting outside, it´s "" a sign"" and of course, I immediately stop eating. It´s mostly things like that. 

I feel like if I ""behave"", things lighten up and if I don´t ""whoops there comes another unpaid bill"" or ""whoops here this or that thing breaks"" and it´s so crippeling again. I´m getting thoughts that hurting myself would make anything better, I´ve had this thing in the past that it´s like ""paying the demons"" and I haven´t self harmed in more than 5 years and now it´s a thought that has been there for days and I don´t want to go back there again.

I can´t take my meds, because I can´t afford them and because my finances are so bad that I want to donate blood, which I can´t while being on meds... I try staying positive, and just stick to my routines and tell myself it´s all not true and that things will become better again but I´m really afraid that if they don´t, I´ll have a major set back. 
Is there anything to prevent a ""breakout"" ? Is it even normal that schizophrenic symptomes are caused by stress, or is it more of a psychothic episode?
I do have doctors to talk to but noone knows I´ve ever even had schizophrenic or psychotic symptomes, because I don´t mention it. I would feel like a fake suddenly talking about it but most of all I´d be afraid getting sent to hospital because a.) I can´t afford it and b.) I don´t have anyone that I´d trust to take care of my dog. And because we are together almost 24/7, he´s inseperapable from me. So this is not an option.

___________________________________________________________

80% of people with schizophrenia are smokers compared to 20% of the general population - I'm curious to see how true that is among the redditors here, because from my experience, almost every other skitzo I've met was a smoker. I also want to know why this is the case. I don't believe smoking causes schizophrenia, because [this](http://www.schizophrenia.com/sznews/archives/000879.html) study seems to suggest it actually prevents it - they followed 50,000 people for 27 years and found that those who smoked heavily were less likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia. This makes me wonder: if smoking doesn't cause schizophrenia, why do so many people with schizophrenia smoke? These are some studies that I found to help me find out: [Here](http://www.schizophrenia.com/szresearch/archives/001061.html) is a study that suggests nicotine helps with our ability to process information, cognitive function, and reduce the side affects of medication. [This](http://www.schizophrenia.com/sznews/archives/001986.html) study suggests smoking improves cognitive function and short-term memory in people with schizophrenia, but does not have a similar effect on people who do not have the illness - [this](http://www.schizophrenia.com/sznews/archives/002062.html) study suggests the same thing. [This](http://www.schizophrenia.com/sznews/archives/002060.html) study suggests nicotine helps people with schizophrenia with auditory processing. I read these, but now I'm looking for opinions from other people who actually have this illness because I feel it would provide insight that I can't get from these studies, and I want to read opinions that aren't my own.

If you smoke and have schizophrenia, could you say if you feel it helps with your symptoms, as in a way of self-medicating? Or do you smoke for some other reason? Did you start smoking before or after you developed schizophrenia?

Personally, I find cigarettes help with my cognitive function, but it could very well be the placebo effect. I'm 16 and smoke 30 cigarettes a day, and I'm worried that I'll suffer a painful death because of it, but at this present moment I feel like they improve my ability to function.

Two nights ago my things went wrong. And as anyone who is close to someone as unstable as my boo knows- living with Sz- shit goes down  A LOT. So to kind of update anyone reading to the situation, here it is in a nut shell: I have been taking care of my boyfriend with schizophrenia on and off for the last 7 years of my life. He goes to live with his dad when I can't take any more and vice versa. We use the LEAP method, we are trained. I went to college/ nursing school and became a psych nurse and I STILL feel helpless. I can't use my skills effectively on him because we will never have a nurse-patient relationship (which turns out to be pretty vital). My degree in mental health nursing means nothing when I am reduced to a helpless family member with a sick lover. I feel so lost.

Rambling...Okay so two nights ago I called the police on John. I have never done this before, but his dad has called many times so the police know him. I worked a 12 hour shift and arrived home tired. There John was, psychotic, didn't take his Zyprexa and was refusing it for dear life. He began rummaging through my purse as I lay in bed trying to sleep. He was trying to take my debit card and keys so he could drive to the gas station for beer and smokes (which he doesn't even smoke or drink unless he is psychotic!) I said to him ""Baby, it's midnight, lets go to bed and we can do something fun tomorrow""- and of course while I said this I know for certain that I'm wasting my breath. He doesn't sleep while psychotic. He spits word salad and walks/drives drunk around the neighborhood. Dangerous! He talks to himself wildly and hisses/growls, screams at satan- you name it. Then he gets mad. Mad because I told him ""no"". I wasn't going to let him use my money for the beer and cigs and whatnot. I told him I wanted no part of him using substances like those because they fuck him right up. I said it a little nicer like a nurse would in real life. He was stuck begging me for alcohol and cigs. I told him I was going to sleep at my best friend's house and let him calm down- thats when it began. He wouldn't let me leave.  He says ""If you leave, you're going to regret it."" And he said ""I'm going to murder your cats."" Anyways, John storms out with my keys and money like ""Cya!"" and I bolt out of bed iPhone in hand, 911 dialed like ""You touch that door with my keys and I'm calling the cops, babe! You can't steal my car or money!"" Well he did. The second I press call- I'm on the phone with the dispatcher crying that I am literally watching my mentally ill boyfriend jack my car. He peeled out. I had work at 6am- it was now 1am and my Sz bf is missing in my car. The cops were LAZY AS FUCK. They saw his ID and practically smirked at each other. John had been picked up many times but never arrested. Picked up for things from walking around a park nude to screaming ""father!"" while running around main street. Time passes to 5am- I'm up reading in bed, planning on taking a taxi to work-and who shows up? The cops with John. He was drinking beer while cruising our neighborhood/apartment complex while blasting music drunk. They took him to his dads house down the road. He called me the next day asking ""Baby let me come home....We can forget this even hap-DROP THE PHONE!"" and he is still psychotic. Screaming at me to drop the phone while I am on the phone listening to him try to psychotically get me back. He says things like ""You think the cops will take me!? HEH! I'm HIM!"" 


He has a few different personalities happening
1.) The Hand. The Hand is an asshole. He starts out with raising his hand up and saying enthusiastically ""It's me!"" ""I'm the hand!"" Sounds funny but its fucking scary. He says the hand likes material, and materials mean drugs. Hand will say the most abusive shit.
2.) Jesus Christ and Jesus's brat son argue with him in his head. John says Jesus and his brat son are angry because he ""tried them"". 
3.) He thinks he is God and has to ""do work"" by waving two fingers at people and blessing them.
4.) Horse-boy. He says he is Horse-boy and the village pillaged his home. Whatever the fuck that means.
5.) Female. Let me get something straight (pun intended, damn it.) My boyfriend John is a STRAIGHT MAN. The schizophrenia has warped his sexuality. He believes he is God, therefore androgynous now. He says that's why it's okay for him to fight women. He HATES women. He backs down when a man tells him to behave, and he respects his father. He has dropped his pants in front of his mother in law and exposed himself, one time while his sister in law was pregnant he went up behind her and told her ""You better run."", and he slapped me across the face twice. He did it a second time because I didn't react the first time! He has never broken anything, and his violent behavior is exactly like a child's. It's a grown man acting like a child throwing a tantrum. 

He loves to push things. When I don't react to his behavior- he escalates it. One time while I was reading a book and he was circling the apartment in a psychotic fit he burst through the door, angry that I was minding my own business and he screams ""WILL YOU JUST INTERACT WITH ME!"" And then I sat with him for an hour listening to ""Why would you? You see, I just did. Yeah? Wow? I didn't and I wouldn't, see- you tried me. That's why. I'm him. I know. That's why I am. Say my name. Say my fucking name. Say it. Say it.""- and it continues. He wont let me sleep. Yes this is every time he is psychotic. It's hell. I always forgive him. I tell  him that he is a victim too. He calls his episodes ""suffering"" and it really is. 
I have reached a point in my life with him that I am helpless. We tried everything. He needs to stay at his father's house and take his medication. He is too sick to live with me or have a life and it breaks my heart. What was I doing all those years trying? Pathetic. I didn't want to walk away from him. But now I have too- he is ruining my life. I love him, but I can't do this anymore. The cops dropped him off and he isn't speaking to me. He blocked my number. I have been talking with his father about me staying away perhaps forever?....:( for my own sake....But I know in a few days John is going to calm down and then beg for me back. He will take the bus to the apartment. He will probably stalk me for a while. I have to be strong and ignore him and his manipulation. His promises and his bullshit. 

Don't judge me for being too weak to walk away- I've heard it before, trust me. I am walking away this time and it fucking sucks and my heart is very broken and I feel very alone. I am sad about schizophrenia and sad about life. I need some love.

Tldr; My life sucks because I'm madly in love with a schizophrenic man who is violent and scary and I'm too weak to just walk away so I need some support. ",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

I started having dreams that weren't quite reoccurring but rather just had the same setting and the same person. She wasn't human, she told me her name was Metispheles and every dream she would tell me more about some world far away from ours and she swears up and down i was once a part of it and that it was imperative that i go back to this world with her. A few months after I started hearing her during the day, along with an oddly calming pan flute-type music. Come the start of last April I started  having really violent tendencies, where i'll suddenly find myself with the crippling need to rip people apart and bathe in blood, with nothing done prior to this to trigger such a reaction.

Within the past few months I've been hearing more violent things from different voices, often in whispering tones ( ""kill yourself"", ""stab him"", ""chop off your hand"", ect., as well as various slurs and negativities.) As well as seeing and feeling someone behind me at all times, seemingly making these comments. This is not Metispheles, I have not seen Metispheles in months. I find myself unable to be in the same room as mirrors and other reflective surfaces, as well as not being able to take pictures or videos of myself. It makes me very distressed to not see this person there.

My relations with my ""friends"" are mostly burnt bridges, as I believe the voices I hear are them, because they often sound like them, and I accuse them of telling me things like that.

I also have the often reoccurring feeling of being covered in bees. Sometimes they're stinging me, sometimes they're not. They mostly reside in my lungs.

Both my therapist and my physc are aware of this, they've been aware since I had to go to a partial program in October because I was seriously thinking of killing myself (wherein they changed my meds to a relatively high dose of Effexor and something I cant remember the name of for sleep. whoops.) I've been on Abilify for about a week now, albeit it's not doing much. And by much I mean anything at all. I'm going to the physc again this afternoon, and I know he's going to send me to the hospital, and I dont want to go. I'm afraid of the hospital. I'm worried the person behind me will literally kill me if I go to the hospital.

Im really concerned about what to call it and I need advice or something, i really dont know.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

The symptoms had become apparent when he was around 21 but since we didn't have a family history that we knew of, it took us a couple of years to fully realize that he had a disease. We probably lost valuable time in the interim. He was under various medications (small doses) for the past two years. He is now 25. (i.e., my nephew had refused to see a psychiatrist, so we outlined the symptoms to the doctor and he prescribed risperidone, olanzapine in small doses of a few mg per day) but nothing seemed to help his symptoms. Exasperated, we admitted him to a mental hospital. For the past 45 days, he has been in a Schizophrenia hospital under 200 mg daily of Clozapine. We are still not sure whether he will turn 'normal'.

My three questions:

1) How long do we need to wait for the drug to have an effect? It has been 45 days now and we are starting to get more worried. His delusional symptoms are slightly lower but have not gone away.
2) Is there hope of a normal functioning life for him in future? We realize he needs to be under medication all his life but is there hope that he can take care of himself?

First off, let me say that I usually smoke a lot of weed. I'm not a big fan of the harder drugs but I have tried mushrooms, LSD, MDMA and some various pharmaceuticals (nothing too intense; hydrocodone, alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam). I also have a history of anxiety and depression with the anxiety being the main focus here. I was diagnosed wrongly with Bipolar Disorder type 2 as well as Borderline Personality Disorder (just because you attempt suicide as a 20 year old you get stuck with this diagnosis it seems). 

I know that anxiety can cause some symptoms of psychosis and even sometimes schizophrenia. With that said, I tend to get caught up in my anxiety a lot. For a month I thought I was going crazy because of my anxiety. I feared that someone was going to break into my house and kill my boyfriend and I. Obviously, this hasn't happened yet.

I fear psychosis and schizophrenia more than anything because i'm terrified of losing control or doing something that's going to put my life or someone's life I love in danger. 

To get to the point, I hear ""voices."" These voices are just that, a voice inside of my head that I know isn't coming from any external source. I talk to myself in my head a lot but I know it's MY voice. And I can change this voice if I want to. It's my own stream of consciousness. Hell, if i'm talking to myself in my head, I even mouth the words most of the time. It's a two way conversation with a one way voice if that makes any sense. I've had this inner monologue for a while and it gets worse when I'm stressed, worried or extremely anxious. Again, I know that no one is ""placing"" these thoughts inside of my head. 

This morning, I was staying at a friend's house. We smoked a quite of bit of purp, had a drink and then we crashed. I was fine until about 4:30am when I woke up to get a drink. Oddly enough, I woke up to an anxiety and depression infomercial. I was fine, listening to what they had to say even agreeing with some of their points and wanting to actually look into the program that they were referring to. 

All of a sudden, this thought popped into my head, ""this commercial is making fun of you.""

As soon as the thought appeared, I knew I was in trouble. I freaked out, started to hyperventilate while trying to talk myself out of a panic attack but it didn't work. I felt crazy for even thinking such a thing. I knew it was an irrational thought but it has been bugging me all day. I feel like a part of me believed that the TV was actually making fun of me for my anxiety and depression. Thinking about it gets the blood flowing to my face and my heart sped up. 

I stopped taking medicine for my anxiety and depression (Cymbalta and Vistaril) because Cymbalta gave me the shits and made me feel drunk while Vistaril made me sleepy. 

I'm just scared because I got over this type of thing once before and now it's coming back. I don't know if i have OCD, intense anxiety or if i'm on my way to a psychotic break or going through the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. 

I'm 23, turning 24 in August, and I don't have a family history of psychosis or schizophrenia that I know of, just a bunch of anxiety and depression.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis as I know I should go see a doctor but I'm just really scared and I need some insight from someone other than myself and my brain right now.

The fact that i'm so concerned about it seems like it would be impossible because i'm too in touch with reality. But again, I just need some insight.

Thanks so much in advance.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

I think current research is seriously lacking.

My aunt (mother's sister) is alone, was never married, and lives near us in LA while the rest of our family is in NY. She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia ~15 years ago. After she was laid off in 2008, she lost her health insurance and stopped taking Haldol.
After her layoff, my mom offered to pay for her health insurance but she said she was feeling great and didn't need medication. When her COBRA ran out, she was 61 (she's 66 now), so it would have only been a few years until Medicare kicked in. Since then, she's been on a downward spiral.

A couple years ago, she called me asking where I was, what I was doing, etc. -- as though she didn't remember anything about me. I called home and told my parents what was going on, and they went to her house with the crisis management team from the mental health department of Los Angeles. When they showed up at her door, my parents asked my aunt to talk to the team and she started yelling/screaming.

The assessment the team made was that she needed to be seen by a doctor, so they called the police. The police showed up, my parents opened the door with a spare key, and the police said that she could either get on the gurney or they would have to forcibly take her to the hospital. She went willfully.

She stayed in the hospital for 10 days and nothing came out of it -- they didn't feel that she was a danger to anyone or herself. After that, she stopped being the typical aunt that we knew. She rarely took phone calls, and when she did, she verbally abused whoever was calling.

A few months later, her apartment's management team called my parents saying that my aunt was throwing chairs in the pool. The crisis management gig happened again and this time, she stayed for 42 days in the hospital -- the maximum hold. They had to get court orders to inject her with various drugs, as she wouldn't take them willingly. Eventually she gave in and would take the drugs by mouth.

After the 42 day stay, the last drug they gave her stuck (don't remember the name) and she returned to normal -- she was sweet, cheerful, called everyone in the family, etc. She stopped taking the medications and then the spiral continued. I was the last person in my family to see her in person (I was least involved with the hospital ordeals, as I was away from college), and when we met up for lunch she cursed my whole family and said she never wanted to see anyone again.

Now, it's been about a year and we're getting calls from the apartment management saying that she's banging on vending machines, they hear her screaming in her apartment, etc. She has a god complex and feels that everyone needs to serve her. While she was in the hospital, my family found HUNDREDS of pages of notes of a world that she made up.

She didn't pay her phone bill so her line is now cut off; my parents are paying for the rest of her bills. I'm wondering what options my family has, as my aunt has no nuclear family of her own. I want to help my aunt and I feel that she should take the medications that turned her back to her normal self. How can we get conservatorship / power of attorney? Please let me know if you need more info. Thanks in advance for your time and help.


tl;dr My aunt is paranoid schizophrenic, has no family of her own, and has isolated herself. She's slowly spiraling downward and I'm worried that she's going to hurt herself / someone else. I'm wondering what the best options are to get her help. She will not talk to anyone in my family.","['dobj', 'dobj']",-1,neu_vader

She called my wife the next morning and the conversation was very strange.  I recognized something was wrong and we went over to her place.  She said 'God"" told her everything was ok and that everything was bullshit.  Then she said there is no god that it was someone else talking to her.  She expressed suicidal tendencies.  We had to force her to the hospital but at this point we thought her electrolytes were out of whack or something medical was going on.

Turns out her uncle was diagnosed schizophrenic and she was cleared medically.  Dr. put her under a form 1 for further psych evaluation which led to diagnosis. She said she felt this way since she was born. She is refusing all her medications and and is starting to slip medically.  Dr. has deemed her incompetent.  

My wife has POA for health issues so hopefully we can force her to take meds.  She has a sizeable estate.  Should we be concerned about her competency regarding her property and finances?  We are worried she may need long term care and that money would be needed.

Can she live on her own successfully with medication or will we have to be watching over her constantly?  We are a little stressed out and wondering how to proceed.

I saw the moderator post some warning about trolls, so I hope I am not breaking any rules.

Medication 
I currently take 30mg of Fluphenazine and 200mg of Wellbutrin.
I am not sure how well the medications are working, I hear voices inside and outside, however, I hear the inside voices much less frequently.

College
I am about to graduate from college in the Fall. I know people usually talk about college fondly, but my experience, with a few exceptions, has been negative. Not because of the dating scene (I do not date anymore by choice) or because of the school work (I struggled during the illness onset but picked back up, I have a 3.6 now). However with Schizophrenia, or any mental illness such as depression, being on a college campus is extremely difficult.

I had bad roommates at my second college, one of them was particularly vicious. He was Desi, I never bother to ask him exactly where he was from, but he was very rude. What odd about this experience is in the past I had Indian in Pakistani friends , but this person I found extremely vile. He acted, for lack of better words, like a ""bro"" and ""redneck"", and he seemed to try extra hard to to fit in with his white peers. I am sympathetic to that, people say I act ""white"" too, but there seemed to be something self loathing about him. Also, people would break into my room, try to find my books (which I hid) and stole my flash drive. The even exited out the window on computer where I had my French assignment and I ended up getting a zero. We also had an oral portion where we recorded our answers on the computer, and since my floor was stalking me they thought Iwas ""cheating"" but I just  completing my assignment.

I got accused of anti-Semitism, because I thought that Hitler' anticommunism was a form of  anti-Semitism and prejudice. I knew that in America, McCarthy used communism to attack minority groups (blacks, gays, jews) so I thought the situation in Germany might have been similar

I got accused of smoking weed, while my first roommate in college really did smoke weed (which was not the bad part). He did however, beat up his girlfriend, and thought I was ""eavesdropping"" because I didn't let him beat the shit out her.

Then I was accused of cheating on my GRE and French CLEPP Exam. Two exams, which I took isolate with a proctor glaring over me. I did not get formally accused of cheating on them, but rather a rumor was spread which said that I did. I am not even sure people really believe the things anymore, I just think they are trying to annoy me.

Voices

I am sure that people yell at me, but I also hear voices. I began hearing voices in late high school, but people were not yelling at me then in the way that they do now. What bothers me is not so much what they are say, but the fact that I am unable to distinguish between two. When I hear someone say I am unable to read, I know it isn't true, so I am able to shrug off, particularly when it is from someone I do not hold in high regard. What bothers me however, is when I am unable to figure out who the voice belongs to. I am not very sensitive to what others think, but rather, to the noises they make. Indeed, my illness has made human and animal noise intolerable. I sometimes confuse the birds chirping for verbal assault. I hear people talking about me in English, regardless of whether or not they are speaking English, German, French, Japanese, Mandarin, or Spanish. This had made watching television impossible. The only animal noise I do not confuse is the sound of my own dog. I wish I lived somewhere a bit quieter 

Dating Relationships

I have never really wanted to date anyone, only for the purposes of social conformity. I have stopped worrying about in recent years which has made me feel better.

Continuing School

I did well on my GRE and foreign language competency, however, I will have some reputation  difficulties in Grad School. I am certain that at least some people do not like, but everyone has people who hate them. I think people were hoping that by simply talking about that I would quit doing what I want to do. However, because everyone is talking about me, no matter what line of work I have, people will dislike me. I have completed all of my requirements. The GRE Exam, and foreign language exam did alot for my confidence, even though people may think I am a stupid, I proved to myself at least that I am not, which I think is enough.

Suicidal Thoughts

I have been thinking about killing myself since I was around twelve. However, although the thoughts remain, the impulse to act on them his gone. This is aided by the fact that I do not own a firearm, and I am not given large doses of medication. I used to feel suicidal because people made fun me, I am not suicidal for that reason anymore, mainly it is because I the psychosis, I still listen to others because they are a valuable source of information, but they do not have the control over my behavior that they once did. What I did decide however, is that I would kill myself when I accomplished all of my goals. I think a the very least I can get an MA in a humanities or social science discipline.  There are also a few more books I would like read as well. I also want to spend time with my dog, he is 17 years old and only has few more years left. 

Therapist 

I think my therapists share the details of my appointments without my consent, with people they shouldn't be. I filed a complaint and I think they are mad at me at the moment. I even here my neighbors talking about my current doctor, the medications I take, and my former doctors. My neighbors seem unaware of the valuable source of information they are, even if it causes me temporary distress, at least it lest me know what people are doing. I no longer really trust my doctor or therapist. I just take the medication, sometimes I think the other things are a waste of time. I heard my neighbor say that I was unresponsive to therapy, I am sure that the doctor is spreading this, I was probably unresponsive to that particular person. Of course, I do not know what therapy supposed to do, they do not suggest to me actual coping strategies, I called a therapist online and he did give me a list of coping strategies which I never was inviting to try by an face to face doctor. He said when I hear others talking about me, I should interpret it as a cognitive disturbance, ore I should laugh it off, because it really is a waste of time for a group of people to be taking about someone they don't know, barely know, or haven't spoken to in years. I did have one other therapist who did this, but I did not see her for long. Therapy right now is not working, because it is not ""therapy"" its just talking. I think it mainly geared towards analyzing me and not for therapeutic benefit.

Things I Enjoy

I very much enjoy books, movies and radio have been taken from me because of the disease, so I have nothing else to do. My dog is old so he does not play. I like it when my Uncle and Aunt visit. I have been having episodes at my house, and my Mom wants me to move. I do not want to however, because I like to see them.

Public diagnosing

I get talked about a lot and untrained people are attempting to diagnose me with illnesses that I have never hear of. I am not bothered by the talk when I can attach to a body, and it is someone I know. My neighbors stare at me a lot and yell at me. I think people are attempting to hurt me in some manner, which they do to some extent, but I do not stop reading and learning because they instruct me to not do so. I never received recognition for those things when people thought well of me. So there is no incentive to stop doing them because I never received recognition for it and  they have become a large part of my life.

Grad School

I was told would not be a good candidate, for ambiguous reason, most of which I am sure have to do with not liking me personally. I do have flaws as a student, but they are not that gross. I Mr. Bush can graduate from Yale, I think I can manage this. I was told that I would fail the 5th grade, that I would not get into college, and that I would grow up to violent and hurt animals. None of these things have happened. My dog is an ""old man"" and nearly as old as I am, I am 21, and I am nearly done with undergrad. One of my negative traits has become a positive one in terms of adult life. I have never done what other people have told me to do, I was always aware of the patronizing attitude they had toward me, and always made sure of exceeding expectations. I do not wish to make sound like everyone evil and that I am perfect. However, my whole life I have had this problem, and while sometimes I feel very sick and I am sure life will be hard, I have become somewhat satisfied in the way I have progressed from when I was young child. I do not think the illness is worth living with, I want to finish what I want to do life, and then end it, in the least painful way possible. 

Friends and Enemies
That being said, I do not think it is that important what others say about, it is only destabilizing to me because of the psychosis. I do not have very many friend, but I do have some good ones. One of them is hypercritical, and she scrutinizes everything I do. That being said, she does not say the same things about me my enemies. There are always people who love you and care about. However, I think what is difficult about life is distinguishing between these people and people who want to do you genuine harm. However, you should never allow people and thoughts that are antagonistic to dictate your behavior to a large extent.

I'm on disability right now, and live in a low income apartment for disabled people.  I'm terrified of taking meds for my disorder, since when I did my weight got over 400 pounds (my schizophrenic cousin did as well and died of heart failure), and I couldn't even think or function (I'm 200 pounds lighter now).  There's also other paranoid things about the meds I'm scared of, but I don't wanna get into that.  :/  

Anyway, one of the things that is a constant worry is that I am on disability, but I seem (mostly) normal.  MOST of the time.  But meeting people, not having a job, telling them I'm disabled when I can go out and walk around and do stuff... I know how that seems.  I want to work, I really do, I just can't hold it together well enough to hold a job.  I've tried several times, it's great at first, then my delusions and paranoia start up, coworkers notice things are wrong, that makes my symptoms worse, and I end up becoming so paranoid I stay at home and hide from the world until I get fired.  It's pathetic.  

This past week or so, I'd been feeling a bit worse, so I isolated myself from everyone and just sort of focused on building up my confidence and convincing myself I was ok.  Being alone with my thoughts can lead to depression, but it can also lead to me feeling like I'm able enough to actually do something with my life.  Well that's where I was yesterday.  

Felt pretty good, was determined to get out there and try to work towards being a productive member of society.  Well, we have a health team come here once a month to do routine checkups (optional).  One of them spotted me and asked if I wanted to get my blood pressure checked.  I went in, and instantly remembered the last time I went they sent me to a doctor that now has me in collections.  

I went immediately from from feeling really positive and happy, to feeling like I was trapped with a group of people trying to destroy me.  But I faked it, and kept pretending that everything was ok.  The nurse then asked me why I wasn't working.  I looked normal, I seemed friendly and engaging, she saw no reason I couldn't find something I could do.  I explained my history briefly to her, but in my mind this probably nice older lady with good intentions was becoming a huge sinister threat to my very existence.  Suddenly, everyone in the room was either looking at me evilly (is that a word?), or deliberately not looking at me so I wouldn't know they were looking at me.  They all became transparent to me, I'd developed a hierarchy for them, this was all a trap and I'd fallen into it.  

I left and went back to my apartment.  I know I'm schizophrenic, and that these perceptions aren't real, but they feel real and they won't go away.  I KNOW I'm being paranoid, I know this wasn't a 'trap', and I know all this sounds really stupid.  

I went out and took the train across town to go walk around and clear my head.  People would see me and smile at me, and my first thought was that they were following me and part of this 'thing' with this woman.  

Even though most of my friends know I'm Schizophrenic, I can't talk to them about this, it sounds ridiculous.  I can't even believe I'm typing this crap out to strangers and the NSA.  I don't want to go to a mental health place because I'm scared if I was honest they'd lock me up, but if I am not honest, they'll pull my disability.  I can't cope with all this, but I can't deal with the side-effects of the meds.  I just very desperately want to be a normal person, and I know I can't be.  I just have to wait until my mind decides I'm a normal person, and hope the experience lasts longer next time.  ",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

I need some people to help me identify what were/are delusions, and what weren't/aren't. I won't argue with you or defend my delusions, as some on this subreddit do.


So, here's the list:


1) I used to believe that I could start a guerrilla war against the Putin regime. That I would recruit a few people, then attack the state armories and steal weapons and store them in a hidden shelter. Then, recruit more and more people with the help of others, and so on, and attack military and government targets. I used to read lots of literature on guerrilla warfare, as well as revolutionary theory. I used to study various revolutions and coups d'etat in order to understand how to lead my own guerrilla war. I'm a native Russian speaker by the way. - 95% sure it's a delusion


2) I used to believe that I had developed an economic model which is superior to both capitalism and socialism, while sharing the features of both. I wrote a paper full of economic models, differential equations, and formulas explaining my point. - 90% sure it's a delusion


3) I used to believe that I could create my own ideology which would become popular, which would be about how democracy isn't preferred, and elected experts would do a better job at governing the population, while being better at fulfilling what the population actually wants by having higher skills. Well, I'm aware that Plato wrote about it in The Republic and that technocracy is a thing, but I actually used to believe that I could make this viewpoint more popular by writing books about it/giving lectures etc. Also, the ideology would feature market socialist/cybernetic socialist/social democratic economic models and such. - 85% sure it's a delusion


4) I used to believe that I could write a program which would plan investments (and make them more efficient) into economy as well as do a range of other things such as avoid the economic crises, plan production quotas, etc. entirely on my own. - 80% sure it's a delusion


5) I used to believe that I could write an artificial intelligence program which would estimate the probabilities of various events happening in the world based on a set of information entirely on my own. - 75% sure it's a delusion


6) I still believe that after graduating with a computer science degree, I could create my own video game developing company and create my own video game which would be successful and which would make me rather rich. - I still believe that, 45% sure it's a delusion though.


7) I still believe that after graduating with a computer science degree and becoming an economics undergrad, I could participate in the research of supercomputer-planned socialist economies, and maybe even make significant contributions to it. - 30% sure it's a delusion


8) I believe that I thought of (and I'm currently writing) a good philosophical thesis. It's about how there's no such thing as 'purely' a priori and a posteriori rationalism and that there's a spectrum between the two, about the relation between empirical data and logic (under the propositional logic model), about the self-refutability of idealism, about the criteria approach to evidence in the realist vs anti-realist debate in the philosophy of science, etc. I also have a second idea for a thesis, which explains how the Keynesian economics is still relevant today due to the Duhem thesis in the philosophy of science. - 30% sure it's a delusion




So which ones of these are delusions, and which aren't? Even if I state that I'm more than 50% sure that something is a delusion, please still tell me whether it's a delusion or not, because I may fall back in the delusional state and start believing it. Having beliefs being confirmed as delusions actually helps, and this strategy prevented me from developing many delusions.

I think it was this one: http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/6/1/10  I've been on keto before, but before I developed schizophrenia. Any time I tried after developing it I didn't stick to it. But I felt better and was losing weight on it and it made my mind clearer when I followed it correctly and did it for a few weeks(before schizophrenia).

I'm definitely willing to try it again whlie now having schizophrenia to see how it effects my symptoms. But the thing is I wanna be off meds when I do it. I wanna be off meds for good, and I think changing my diet, exercising at least once a week since now I do nothing, could really change and help me. I need healthier coping skills anyways.

The worst part of my meds is that they increase appetite or make me gain weight as its own side effect. I've gained enough that my old clothes don't fit and that's bringing me down a lot and making me very self-conscious. That's a big part of why I want to stop meds, that and the side effect of throwing up after I take them every now and then. I'm supposed to take them with food, and I always do, but sometimes it doesn't work and I still get sick. 

I haven't been very consistent with my meds lately. I missed two days, then took a dose the next, then missed three days, and then took a dose the next, and now I'm continuing to take them but only until I can talk to a psychiatrist about this diet. Then I'm gonna try and get the psychiatrist to agree with me that this is worth a shot to try without meds.

He's currently on Abilify oral (5mg) and seeing a therapist. He recently switched from one therapist whom he'd been seeing for a few years to a new one. This new one has included me, to a degree, in his treatment by doing a few group sessions and making it open for us to have group sessions pretty much whenever and at our discretion.

Now, his last therapist was awful. By the time they closed out his case and transferred care, it was essentially a one hour conversation about how the therapist was doing and his opinions on the world. Clearly not helpful. This new therapist (you'll know this if you saw my last post) is really trying to push the Abilify IM depot on him, much to our annoyance, and was originally talking about a partial hospitalization outpatient program (read: adult daycare... not what we want either). 

Unfortunately, we live in America, and we aren't rich, and have very mediocre insurance, so we can't just pick a good therapist and have to deal with what we get. My problem is that this therapist doesn't seem to be discussing any sort of cognitive therapy plan to help teach my SO how to retrain his thinking or cope with the paranoid thoughts and occasional over the top episode type times. I really don't think this therapist is going to make a plan, but he'll at least have someone to whom he can feel free to vent.

Anyway, my question is this: have any of you found a cognitive therapy plan that has worked to help you deal with your paranoid schizophrenia? Are there exercises you find helpful or mantras that help? I'm always telling him he should meditate, but he doesn't, and I try to tell him to get out of the house with our kid during the day (go to the park or something) but he can find it really anxiety inducing if I'm not with him. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I'm hoping he'll listen a bit more if it's coming from someone who's used it successfully for a similar disorder. 

TL;DR: I don't think medication should be the ONLY tool my SO is using, but our therapist doesn't seem to be decent enough to prescribe cognitive treatments/exercises and acts more like a confessional that throws out positive affirmations occasionally. If you have a cognitive exercise that has helped you (or a loved one) suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, I'd really like to hear it. We need to try SOMETHING.

Edit: words are hard

Edit 2: I see on the sidebar to refrain from advising treatments. I just want to say I understand you're not a therapist or a medical expert of any sort. I am not going to hold anyone responsible for the advice they give. I just really want to know what has worked for you or a loved one BEYOND medication. I don't think medication is enough, but unless we can afford to pay like $100-200 a session, I can't seem to find a therapist for him that agrees with me. He is under care of a ""professional"" and on psychiatrist prescribed medication, so I'm not seeking this advice as his only treatment plan.

Do you people who also hear ""imaginary"" voices (I mean ""hallucinations"") think that your own mind somehow chooses what the voices say? I think that this is a hard question. I can think that some peoples schizophrenia symptoms can be really bad and their imagination can be so weird that they can't socialize or act reasonably. Me, I'm not that kind, nowadays I use an injection type of medicine monthly and I used to think in my hardcore psychosis that I have telepathic abilities and superpowers like an ability to manipulate people etc but I was a lot on drugs in my past and drugs triggered my schizophrenia. When I was a lot on drugs weird things happened like telepathic experiences but they could have been (very likely or to some users not likely at all) hallucinations so/or they had something to do with the magic of drugs. Nowadays I pretty much just hear a lot of ""imaginary"" voices and kind of think that people can read my thoughts even though no one has never red my thoughts out loud when I haven't been on drugs, but I'm careful with my thoughts. I can't remember passwords because I think that someone can get them from me as the voices I hear sometimes repeat what I think. That's why I always write them down and try to not remember them. And there is a big possibility that when I have been on drugs I've been hallucinating and no one has actually spoken my thoughts. It has happened tho and all the doctors say that nobody can hear my thoughts. I've been thinking also that maybe I create thoughts as voices a little bit with my tongue or something so that they can kind of be heard, but most of my thoughts that are not words seem to be created upper in my head, like in my brains, than in my mouth. Anyways, I've been just thinking that is there a possibility that someone somewhere is thinking thoughts for me and that's why I hear speaking voices, called hallucinations. So I'm thinking that am I left on a drug trip that is so weird that my mind can't identify some of my own thoughts and they come from 3rd person view and still I have my own clear mind with me, since my personality really isn't devided like so that I have alter egos that take control of me or anything like that. Just thinking that could some of the voices be real and identify my thoughts even tho most people can't. Still, even tho I'm a pretty clear and social person and no one never notices or asks me am I scizophrenic and I don't speak weird stuff, I think that telepathy is in my everyday life, even though it really usually doesn't work, but somehow it is there, sometimes I have to ""swear"" something in situations where I'm teliing something, for example a couple of weeks ago at the police station when picking up a new passport I suddenly hear as a though-kind of voice the voice of the police officer as we speak that ""are you mafia"" or ""do you do drugs"" and they say ""swear"", and in my thoughts I ""swear"" to the officer and then things go on normally. If I sometimes don't swear things usually go on normally too and I can make the voices be stupid by thinking something stupid. That's just one example. It happens all the time. Stupid daily stuff, thoughts that are there but not maybe real in the situations. Sometimes my voices have pre-said something that is to be said like seconds before it is said by someone so they have kind of predicted situations. Coincindence? It has happened many times. It is proven that people have some kind of emotional connection like for example as like horses can sense if you are afraid or a dangerous person based on the energy that comes from you, or something like that. A stupid example maybe but you know what I mean. As I can create stupid ""telepathic"" conversations I think that most of it is imaginary but where's the connection with the weird telepathic experiences most of us schizophrenics (at least) have had, I think, and everyday life thinking that no one can hear, says the doctors? Is my mind just fucked up because I hear voices or do you think that there is a possibility of something ""unnatural"" following me? Sorry that this is a long text but these are my thoughts. What do you think? Do you people who also hear ""imaginary"" voices (I mean ""hallucinations"") think that your own mind somehow chooses what the voices say?

I just kept doing the illegal activity and didn't even notice it.   Like, what is wrong with going about your life off meds with an alien in your head messing around with you?  He's been cloning my mind and I can't tell what I want to think and do sometimes until like I reach a point where I have to realize what he is suggesting is not good for me.  I've been reading about mental illness so I can figure a way to ""get out of jail"" in case I do something wrong and so ill have an explanation for this perceived act that I might commit.  But then again, I go around my day acting fairly normal even though I have these thoughts.  So should I continue and try to regain my freedom or go back on antipsychotics?  I'm leaning towards staying off and seeing how far this goes but it feels dangerous.  Also, meds don't get rid of the alien.  He's there all day long everyday for the last 15 years.  So again, what's the point of meds?",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

Background:  She is very intelligent and seems to be one step ahead of getting diagnosed which blows the mind.   She’s been to physicians and they say she’s depressed.   She walks out of the doctors office and starts sending everyone emails on how people are watching her through the TV, everyone’s talking about her, etc.    The messages become more aggressive and erratic.   So far, we’ve had minimal luck getting her help and after long bouts of convincing her to seek medical attention, she takes medications for a day or two and then stops returning back to the state of crying and screaming for the duration of the day (among other things).
So whats changed:  she’s becoming increasingly aggressive, like making 2AM visits to family’s homes screaming obscenities in the middle of the street and making damaging innuendos (like her 84 year old mother is selling drugs, etc.).   She’s been also in a few traffic accidents and we’re not sure where exactly those are in terms of resolution.    She’s more or less in the hands of the ‘street’.  She’s also showed moderate signs of violent behavior (she’s attacked at least two of her siblings, bare hands/no weapons).
What we’ve done so far:  She’s in the United States, so we’ve tried to speak to various social workers, as well as trying to get help from the State to get her committed.   All avenues have been dead ends so far.   For example, legally we’re getting the answer that unless she’s a danger to herself or others there is nothing we can do.   She’s also seen probably a half dozen doctors, and I think at least 2-3 of them refuse to see her any longer.
Where things are right now:   The rest of the family has been joining a concerted effort to pay for her apartment and car (I think the latter is a bad idea considering the fact that she can do much damage with a vehicle).   She still calls family once in a blue moon demanding more money (at which time she may unload 20 minutes worth of aggressive blabber about how someone is controlling her, watching her though the TV or listening to her phone conversations).
Any advice?   What can we do?  We want her to get help but we feel stuck at a dead end and can’t even get out of the starting gate when none of the professionals seem to be able to even make the diagnosis of schizophrenia… I mean… Does depression make you hear voices and think people are watching you through the TV?

A while ago, I quit smoking marijuana. I had never had any psychological problems with it before then. Weeks later, I succumbed to it and dove straight back in again. My tolerance must have dropped a lot, because I had a very vivid, intense experience. I started to think people could hear my thoughts, and I could hear theirs. I think this is different than an audible hallucination since I am aware it is occurring in my head. (right?) I created this whole other side of the world, completely unprovable yet self-consistent. I won't go into details, since I think that if I could be convinced of this, so could others, and I wouldn't want to put anyone through that. Not being able to have privacy inside your own head is a horrible experience, and has led me to think more negative thoughts than I think I typically would.

I've tried smoking twice since, because I didn't want to believe I couldn't smoke, or that marijuana was bad, but both times sent me spiraling back into thought broadcasting.

It's over a year later, and this has not gone away. I'm on meds for the delusions, and I'm getting better at dealing with it so its faded from what it was, but in social situations I sometimes get thrown back into it.

Does anyone else here thought broadcast? What should I know? Have you had similar delusions? What has helped you through them?

Also, what is everyone's opinion on marijuana? Has it helped or hurt? Any particularly good or bad experiences?

According to my psychiatrist I've been in denial about this illness since I have been diagnosed. Personally, very often I don't feel like there is anything wrong, but according to him it is because I don't have insight about when things happen like hallucinations. I think that is really weird. The only time I've been aware something was wrong was when I got really depressed out of nowhere and kind of had a ""break"" with reality and found the evidence of it in the morning... story later if anyone is interested or whatever. Even when the police made me go to the psychiatric hospital a while ago I didn't think anything was really wrong, and still don't (about the time).

My psychiatrist hates me because I never take my meds because of this denial (why take meds for something that isn't there?!) and I am scared he is going to have me expelled.

The reason I say all this NOW is because my boyfriend is getting help for his depression (yay for him!) and it made me think about this diagnosis and everything and wonder if anyone else has denial about it. Also because things are getting ""bad"" (being out and see something, laughed and point it out, no one else sees it, seeing peoples mouths move when apparently they are not, people are following me, but logically why, what did I do?) and maybe I should go back to psychiatrist and get back on meds but not if none of this is real illness...

First time poster on this subreddit - and I'm hoping to explore and engage an issue that's been affecting me for a few years now. 

About 5 years ago, one of my closest friends was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Since then, he's had a number of what you might call ""psychotic breaks"" (all of which correlate with him coming off his medication and restarting weed smoking.)

It disagrees with him.

Unfortunately, when he's going through the deteriorating phase before a break, he's more angry and defensive than ever - certain beyond all certainty that he's saner than ever and that we're just being ""squares,"" (despite the fact I've probably taken more drugs in my younger years than he's had hot dinners - but that's ultimately irrelevant.) As such, he becomes beyond help and ends up hospitalised. It seems like if he would only listen to reason he could save himself a lot of hassle. But he resists. Always resists - always thinking he's in the right, even when very clearly to everyone - his family, friends, loved ones, associates, that he's yet again losing touch.

Then of course he ends up hospitalised thinking that god is talking to him or some shit, and that goes on for a few months until he comes back around again. Then he becomes sheepish and logical for a short while, determined to get back on track, and then it goes south again.

Since his last ""break"" about a year ago, he was put on a drug which I think is called ""clopixol"" or something like that. It has a heavy sedative effect. 

This has caused him to become more lethargic, defeated and more depressed than ever. Although ultimately I don't absolutely blame the drug, as I feel he ultimately bears his own responsibility for his own behavior.

Still, at this point he's completely withdrawn himself from his close friends (a number of us have been close friends for over twenty years - growing up in school together into adulthood.)

He's withdrawn, depressed, grumpy, rude and frankly, has become a real selfish prick. If you say something and he takes it negatively (even if it wasn't negatively intended,) he flat out ignores you for a few weeks. Then you get a phone call, where he's pretending to be all nice and friendly, and he ignores the preceding weeks as if they hadn't happened. Is this normal behaviour for someone with schizophrenia, or is he just being a dick?

On the flipside, if you do say something that is negatively intended, after he's acted like an asshole, then, in most cases you would expect people to own up to their mistakes. He doesn't. He just entrenches himself, refuses to acknowledge his behaviour and isolates himself further. It's like engaging with a toddler. He's 29.

It seems like now you can't point out even the basic acts of weird, irrational, rude behaviour that he engages in, otherwise he just blanks you and cuts you out of his life until he gets lonely and calls you back up. 

This is harmful, as a lot of the time his behaviour is rude, aggressive and overall pretty shitty. There's only so many excuses I can make for the guy in other people's company.

In a way, it feels like he uses his illness as an excuse to act like an asshole, and if you don't absolutely capitulate to him, he either blanks you, or resorts to vicious, violent insults and on the worst occasions, mind meltingly illogical arguments that don't even make any sense. 

It seems pretty clear to me that he knows, a lot of the time, that he's being unreasonable and selfish, and he thinks he can get away with it because he has schizophrenia. It's regressive. It's annoying. I just want the guy to be reasonable, to be happy, for us to all get on again like we used to. On the one hand he has a debilitating illness, on the other I think he takes advantage of it as an excuse to behave in a way he might be able to get away otherwise. So I empathize with him, pity him and also at the same think that he's being a selfish asshole, and my sympathy runs out.

How the fuck do I help my friend? Or can I?

I thought you guys might have more insight and knowledge in this than I do. I want him to be happy - and I want him to be able to live a happy life. As it stands, he just drinks himself to sleep every night, spastifying himself in front of the tv, ignoring his life, getting government funding, all of which he spends on shit like ipads, mobile phones and alcohol and cigarettes. I don't really care about the government funding in itself, I just wish he could better himself instead of pissing his money, life, years, friendships and opportunities away. As someone with a small income, it definitely grates to see someone piss so much money away on frivolities when I can't even afford the basics, but I'm prepared to overlook that - not that it justifies his behaviour.

He's become really unpleasant to be around. And worse when he's unpleasant, but refuses to acknowledge it. 

Is that part of the illness, or has he just become an asshole? I honestly don't know now.

He's a complete shadow of the guy I knew, and he doesn't seem to want to help himself. 

Bleh.

Thanks for listening. This is so frustrating.

It's made me delusional to the point where my doctor today almost had me hospitalized involuntarily because I accidentally threatened to kill myself. I realized how deeply I believe these things when she tried to disprove me, and I argued angrily back with her. I told her this world isn't real, we're all in a matrix and the moderators of this matrix are demonic 4-dimensional beings who are after me because I realized we're in a matrix. Also told her that there is a specific type of car sent by them to follow me everywhere, and some people have been replaced with demons to spy on me. I never thought it would get to this point, I've never had a full on psychotic break that I'm aware of like this.

I've had a psychotic episode that lasted 2 days:

* auditive hallucination (hospital sounds I've never heard before in my life)
* smelled like hospital medicine or something; when I approached people that probably had a sweet smelling perfume it would smell like lavender room spray
* made me freak out, I thought I was in a coma in reality

It stopped after 2 days. I did go to see a doctor and I was put on olanzapine for 3 weeks then I stopped.

I've had an other one that lasted 1 day(4 months later):

* smelled like incense, Initially I freaked out thinking I'm in hell, but I stopped thinking that because it would've caused some terrible paranoid decisions

Then it stopped (again, without taking medicine) then I went to see the doctor again, took zyprexa for 6 months till this day and I'm still taking it.

These were all caused, in my opinion, by the 5 xanax I took but the doctor says it can't do that to me. It is to note that the first one was about 10x more hallucinative then the 2nd one, everything was vivid. The 2nd one was just a slight sensation without the vividness and brain sensations I had the first time. Very big difference between the 2 episodes.

He always takes good care of me.. except when it comes to things like this.  He offered me cash (we live together) for my anxiety and my pain meds.  He knows I don't get them refilled until Monday, and I was suffering.

I told him that I was hurt, that he sees me bent over in pain.. yet instead of saying, ""Hey baby, do you need your medicine?"".. he tried to buy some from me.  I have never, ever shared medicine with him.  This again, is what I started taking, when he said it was no fair I smoked pot.

I have awful anxiety, along with a pile of diagnosis codes.. none of which need anti-psychotics.. but he often tries to give me his seroquel when I am upset.

He is very handsome, to be honest.. he even admits that he usually gets annoyed when he tries to guilt a girl.. and it doesn't work.  I told him it will never work on me, and it just makes me feel guilty.. and pushes me away.

I brought it up today, that I was sad that he would be ok with taking pain medicine from me (I didn't have any, but he would have if I did) while I was suffering so much.  I told him that if he loves me, as much as he says he does (we have been talking marriage).. that he would say, ""Baby, ease your suffering with YOUR medicine"".  His reply was ""WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO START A FIGHT?""  

I made sure I did not use an accusing tone.  I was very honest, and I was very calm.  I said ""when this happens, you don't mean to, but it hurts me"".. How can I get across my point to him, without him accusing me of ""fighting"".

He has admitted, especially with women, he can be manipulative.  He threatened to move out once, because I wasn't going to give him my klonopin.  I told him to go ahead, that I would not let him mess with my emotions like that.  He is the one who taught me to NOT let people emotionally bully me.  Then he goes into a ""shame spiral"".. where he says he is sorry.  I think he is more sorry that I am not happy, and it has nothing to do with actual remorse for his actions.

Since he has moved in.. he has not had an episode of delusions, or catatonic.. This is amazing, as he was diagnosed in mid 2012, and has had 13 hospitalizations since then.  After we got together.. he has gone the longest without needing to be hospitalized.

A third person mentioned that if I don't take my medication I am a danger to people around me and should be locked up.

This shows that we face an uphill battle when dealing with the so called normal people. One wouldn't consider telling a black or gay person such things, but somehow it is acceptable to treat a schizophrenic as though he was an invalid. Even if he took medication and was otherwise well.

This is going to be a pretty long post, so if you rather not read it, here it the tl;dr. My family doesn’t seem to understand and believe me, and that makes me feel alone beyond the fact of being friendless. I want to be happy and normal during this summer, but with this downward spiral, that won’t happen.  Thank you to those who take their time to read this all. c: 

I remember when I first tried to tell my mother about my symptoms. I have had the paranoia, hallucinations, and voices throughout my entire life. I would like to add that I am only fifteen, so using “my entire life” may seem odd. Maybe, since I can remember would fit it better. But I first tried to tell her when I could not stand it anymore, keeping it locked in my chest because I was scared she would hate me. Think of me a freak. 

I was eleven and we were in the car, it came down all at once. It told her about laughing at a school shooting, how empty and emotionless I felt. That I did not feel remorse for laughing, but at the same time, it scared me. I told her about the vivid figures that would follow me, or lurk in the corners. I told her about voices in my head, that can range in their loudness like a dripping faucet, or one on full blast. I was frightened and even younger than I am now. 

Her reaction was pure anger; she scolded me for laughing and not knowing why. She took me into our home upon reaching it and told my father. They both proceeded to call me a sick and disgusting person and so on. It went on for a couple of hours; it only made me feel worse. All they spoke of was the whole laughing thing, their main focus, not caring about the hallucinations or what I hear. I had barely any friends for a good deal of my life, and now my parents turning against me only made it worse. 

They have been a bit, rude, in the past to me. In the hours of night as a child when I could not sleep, speaking to myself they would scream and yell to shut up. They would pass everything off as an imaginary friend if I tried to comment on one of my “permanent”?, hallucinations named Jack, telling me to do awful things. Such as kill the pet dog, jump off the roof, calling me ugly or to self-harm. It made me not tell the whole story to my mother for so long. 

My father is a drunk. So after this came out, he loved to just exploit me. When I came home from school, he would wait there, drink in hand, to tell me how big of a fuck up I am. He got incredibly cocky when he got a call home from school. I reached out for help to a teacher by writing song lyrics from a song titled Bullet, to her, telling her how bad things were in my head. It was obvious at the time I was really depressed, and sulky, and had no idea how to get the words out of my mouth. 

He asked me, “So you decided to try and get taken away? Ruin my reputation?” The night was spent with him screaming at me, how I should just shut up and keep everything inside. Because I am fucking up his life, where he went wrong in this world. My voices and overall anxiety got very bad because I thought he was going to hurt me. I started seeing him on my bus, in my room with a gun, in abandoned homes where I found peace. I tried to tell my mother, but she did nothing. He always acted nice around her, like nothing happened. 

But I still complained to her, and finally she took me to a therapist. It was hard to trust him, and he mentioned an overnight visit already on day one. He did not keep me, thankfully, yet this made future visits hard to get words off my tongue. I eventually vented to him. He recommended me to a psychiatrist for paranoid schizophrenia, and he said he did this quicker than he did for other patients. That made me feel even more out of place. Especially with my father calling me a “pussy” and weak for wanting help. Saying in his childhood, he never had help, because he compared his father abusing him with fists to my schizophrenia. I won’t say that abuse isn’t bad, but it is like comparing apples and oranges in my opinion. 

He got mad because he said I rather talk to some stranger about my problems than my own parents. The way they reacted every time I felt suicidal, every time I got scared because I thought someone was out to get me and kill me, they treated me like some foreign object to be poked with a stick. Or to run away in fear and disgust. That is why I eventually trusted a stranger over my own flesh and blood. My first visit to the psychiatrist was scary. They wanted a blood and drug test, which needles make me cry. I get scared something big can go wrong. They wanted to keep me overnight because I mentioned the hallucinations sometimes involve me murdering people, or ways to kill myself. 

I did not stay that time. My mother was still doing paper work when my father and I got into the car. He yelled at me like many times before, asked if I was trying to get taken away, that I am a huge disappointment and failure to him. He happily discussed medicine with my mother, as I was crying in the back seat, with Jack right in my ear. There are other voices, but she seems to be a ring leader. She also has come to me in dreams and real life. Months carried on like this, and after self-mutilation, an attempt at suicide, I was hospitalized. 

I lied my way through it all, that I was okay. From then on, I lied to my parents too, so that they would treat me better. I still dealt with everything that nobody else could hear, see, or feel. I became very detached from everyone, my therapist, my psychiatrist, my family, and I stayed in a small corner of my room a lot. I tried to vent in any way possible, through my writing, through my drawings, and on my skin with knives and teeth. I hid it all, and wore a mask of pure happiness, despite the detachment obvious. My father still made this all worse. My parents forced me sometimes to the houses of their friends. When I would sit in a corner my father, making sure nobody was around, would call me an embarrassment, that I better not be going back to how I was. 

A couple years of this and here we are now. My mask was starting to have little cracks; my big disguise was falling down. When I get very over whelmed by my voices, I cry, hyper ventilate, and laugh all at once. I tried doing this alone, but my mother found me one time. I looked at her and I told her about the dead bodies of my peers hanging from my ceiling, gutted and I was covered in their guts. I believed I killed them. I was crying and hyper ventilating and laughing. I have told my mother about Jack. She thinks that my laugh during this is from Jack, who often likes to laugh at the abuse of others and myself. 

She says I sound possessed. Whether Jack can come out through me, or it is just a change or my laugh during the time, my mother got scared. I was recently admitted again, for a stay of two weeks. I again I lied my way out, I hugged my mother and I told her I was okay. I told her I just needed a break from everything for a little. But after this recent visit, my father is slowly turning horrible to me again. Often doors are slammed, voices are raised, and I go back to a knife, and tug my long sleeves down. 

For a time, I was genuinely getting better, because I did meet someone who has helped me a lot, who actually cares. Yet unable to speak to them for a little, my crutch slipped from under me and I fell. Everything became worse in a spiral. I have been able to deal with not talking to them in the past, but with the way my life is being right now, I cannot deal with it. I am scared I won’t get better before I move to another state with my grandmother and wonderful cousin. To them I have always had my smiling mask on, a perfect person. 

I want to be that person without trying to fake it. It is wearing down on me. Having to sing and dance on a stage for everybody, yet when I walk down the steps, turn my back on those who think I am okay, I am crying. Drawing a lot lately has helped, but I cannot show the art to my parents. I have shown my thoughts on paper in the past to be treated like an outcast. It shows what its like having voices in my head. My hallucinations and what I saw, or just pure anxiety. I have to hide it all. It feels dirty and sick in a way to keep lying; my guilt is eating me up. 

I have nobody to turn to, but you guys. I just want to feel better, and happy. I have to pour out my thoughts to somebody because my past two weeks have been spent crying when I can get away from everyone, hurting myself and trying to act stable through my own thoughts. To say, it has helped a lot, even before posting this. I only want advice on how I can try and hide this all further, without cracking.

Don't know if that makes sense. More like... If I watch a movie, I know it's all fake, even if it looks real. 

I am coping better. Thanks everyone for helping me out, I hope I can get my life back on track. I know it will be hard, but seems like I managed to kill off the psychosis early, so it will be easier to get up again. 

This was the second serious psychotic tendency I've had so far this year. Usually I go have one every two years, and now two in less than six months. I think something else is going on in my life that I have to work out, usually I get psychotic when stuff are bad generally, so there is something else I need to figure out. I'll have to think more about that when my brain is not filled with delusions.

I had a serve psychotic episode in January due to drugs, and I'm slowly recovering, I was diagnosed as schizoaffective on 100mg Zoloft and 7.5mg Zyprexa and Colonazepam when I need it.

I feel much better with medication, but I suffer from affective blindness. The only symptom of my illness still present. To describe how I feel my emotions to do with visual stimuli and time and space are totally blunted. My room doesn't feel like my room, the lunch room at work doesn't feel reliving and comforting during break time. I feel no emotion from where I am and where I travel, driving down the freeway late at night with the windows down I used to feel a cool calm feeling about the things around me. This is all gone now.

Has anyone tried any medication that can get rid of this symptom. Lamactal looks interesting and I will bring it up when I see my doctor next.

I have no motivation to do it anyways. I feel depressed, unmotivated, confused. 

Are my voices going to come back full force? I gues.. I stopped taking my meds yesterday because I decided I wanted to hear their message that I can't while on meds. They have something important to say to me, I know it, but I can't hear them with the meds, it's poision to their words. 

I have a six page essay due on Wednesday. Like the lazy college student I am, I've put it off 'till the last week we have to do it. And now I can't do it. I try to read the instructions and I get so overwhelmed. 

And for God's sake- it's a Political Science class and I'm supposed to write SIX PAGES about California's national seal, its history probably, and what I'd give it for a new design. 

I can't even think about the essay though. I have time until Wednesday to do it I guess, but I wonder if I can get out of it somehow, or at least get more time until I feel better. My professor knows I'm schizophrenic. I imagine he'd be pretty supportive if I told him I was struggling with the work and that I couldn't focus enough on the assignment enough to get past the instructions for it.

I'm freaking out. I'm taking ONE class this semester. Political Science is it. If I fail my ONE class then I'm truly a waste of space. I have to pass this class. And I think I am doing ok in it so far. We've had 2 tests, 1 I've passed, and the other doesn't have results yet. But I think I did ok. 

Fuck. I just want to die. I can't do this. I can't focus. I'm so anxious. No motivation. Just procrastination.

I want to hear the voices, loud and clear, tell me to die one last time just so I have an excuse. C'mon voices, scream at me like the old days!

The truth is they have a message for me. It's probably going to be that I have to kill myself to save them again. It's always that. They always try to get me to kill myself.

Fuck I'm not doing well. Please someone help me. What do I do about my school stuff? I feel pretty suicidal. Want to cut, too. It's a mess. The voices aren't even back yet. They're not a threat. I'm only going to end up hurting myself.

Do I go to the hospital? I don't think it's that serious yet. Maybe if I actually cut it will be serious. 

I'd go but I have this stupid essay and class next week. Fuck I'm so weak. Stupid. 

I want school to be over so I can get hospitalized without worrying. 

Should I email my professor something? Something like, ""As you know I have schizophrenia, and I'm getting sick lately. As a result I haven't been able to focus or think. Haven't been able to work on that essay due next week. I need an extention, or a cancellation. I can't function. I get too stressed and overwhelmed by the mere instructions of this work and I can't do any of it. I'm sorry but please let's work on a way to resolve this issue. I need your help. "" 

Someone help me please. PLEASE. My brain feels like it's breaking and I feel so gorram alone in the world. No family. They've abandoned me. My sister moved away with my nephew who was like a God, I adored him, and my mom is on vacation for the weekend. All I have is my stepdad and he's never home and when he is it's filled with cigarrette smoke. Not understanding. He's not understanding. 

I have friends, of course, but the most comforting one is stuck working away all weekend. My best friend. I have another but she can't help me.

I fear I need to be hospitalized but I don't feel anywhere near as bad as I've been to need that before. 

But I feel like I'm losing control. And writing too much. I think I want to cut really deep and go to the hospital for that. That'd feel good. 

I'm still worried about school though. 2 classes left and I have my first degree, an AA only but I worked damn hard for it. I have to function through the next semester as well. 

Please please help me someone. Please. I don't know what to do next. ",['pobj'],-1,neu_vader

For a year now I have not known what is wrong with me. I am seeing a psychiatrist and they have not yet diagnosed me with anything, although they have said I suffer from paranoid psychosis(whether that means I am schizophrenic or not I am not sure). 

Firstly I will say I suffer from paranoia, that much is obvious to me, it is much worse when I am out in public, every-time I hear someone talk or laugh I think they're talking or laughing about me. I was also(for like a month) under the impression that all of the meds I am on(abilify and certraline) are placebos considering they don't seem to be working at all and I am just as bad as I was when all this started a year and a bit ago(I am 17 now). I have also been having thoughts/voices I am not sure which they are, I don't physically hear them but I am not in control of them and they talk to me as if they're not me, they range from my voice to my friends and families voices. They usually yell at me or tell me scary shit like ""Someone is coming to kill you and they will be here in 35 seconds RUN"", being the most recent one I had(in school today). I always feel angry too, and often catch myself thinking about hurting people I don't like. It is all getting too much for me, my parents can't take much more of my shit considering I can be extremely abusive towards them when I am paranoid despite always feeling terrible about it afterwards. Recently I have also not being feeling any kind of feelings towards other people and I don't really want to talk to them, although this isn't one of my bigger problems.

That's basically it, I will add more if I think of anything else, it's pretty late right now so y'know, and despite my name I do not and have never done any drugs or smoked/drank. Once again sorry for the wall of text, I am just really wondering whether you guys think I am schizophrenic or not! Thanks in advance.

I'm trying to be sympathetic and patient but it's very difficult. She talks loudly all night from around midnight til sunrise. She accuses me of stealing her food and of bringing strange men into my room at night to rape her... She's generally well-kempt and she's on medication but I don't know how many more nights I can go without sleep because she's so verbal and noisy.

My mother was diagnosed as schizophrenic when I was a baby.  The first time she had an episode was 1 week after my birth and my father had no idea what was happening.  She was eventually hospitalized and given the diagnosis of schizophrenia. I am now 33 and I also have a 34 year old brother.  My father and her are still married and live together. 
The majority of the time my mother is on her medication and ""fine"" beyond some of the side effects from the meds.  No one outside our family would realize anything is wrong and honestly I was brought up not speaking about the problem when she is ""fine"" the family doesn't even talk about the schizophrenia. 

She seems to relapse every 3-5 years which results in eventual hospitalization.  Her last relapse was about 4 years ago and actually lasted for an entire year until it reached a point that her weight was dangerously low and her behavior increasingly concerning.  After a 10 hour ordeal of me calling 911, followed by something called the SCIP unit they were able to convince her to go with them (she was basically told she had to go with them or they were going to take her against her will).  Within 24 hours of being admitted and on whatever medication they had her on she began to come out of it, feel extreme regret at stopping her medication and was very apologetic.  She got ""better"" so quick and we finally had our mom.  She was so happy to be back home and to herself.   

I am not 100% sure which schizophrenia she is diagnosed with but  when she relapses and and enters what I guess would be called psychosis these are her symptoms:

* Stops sleeping/insomnia
* Eating habits change (last time she lost over 50lbs and obsessed over her weight.  She will also binge drink soda and chain smoke.  
* She becomes incredibly angry at my father and grandmother.  My parents are still married and currently my father and her live alone together.  She will get in my fathers face and state things that are not true ..as my father walks away she will throw herself in front of him and then if he as much as places a hand on her to attempt to get by her she will scream and fall to the ground claiming he is beating her.  I have witnessed this many times and my father is not being aggressive or beating her. 
* She withdraws from everyone and everything. 
* She will talk to herself, pace around the kitchen and go from crying to laughing.  She will yell about JFK and Jackie Kennedy and seems to think she is part of their family.  She will turn on music and just dance ridiculously around the kitchen. 
* She has no awareness at all when she is in psychosis that something is wrong.  She will claim she doesn't feel well and has a fever or the flu.

So my problem is because of all the laws we have an incredibly difficult time getting her early intervention or help.  Last weekend is when she began to relapse so I immediately called the SCIP unit who sent someone out to evaluate her, she of course said everything was fine (she just ""has a fever"") and declined any type of help.  They unfortunately said they could tell something was ""off"" but since she did not present as a danger to herself or others they could not make her go.  Basically we now have to wait until she reaches rock bottom before we can get help.  

Does anyone know any other way around this?? What can we do?  I fear for my fathers safety even though she has never threatened herself or others I do have that fear one day with her anger towards him she will act out.  

When she is medicated she is aware of the illness and 100% clear that she does not want to be off her meds and always regrets going off them when she relapses.  

We don't know what to do.  I'm happy to answer any questions people might have.  We all love my mother very much and I can't imagine losing her to this for another 6 months or even a year because we have to wait for it to get bad enough for help.  

She is in NJ- if that matters.  

Thanks.

I'm writing today because things have been really rough with my husband's mother, and I'd like some outside opinion on what could really be wrong with her and what I can do to help this woman.

A bit of background information: she is 65, diagnosed manic bipolar about 10 years ago, and had her thyroid completely removed about 5 years ago because she had thyroid cancer. She's supposed to be taking a synthetic thyroid medication daily but we're not completely convinced that she does. Her husband just passed away in August which would understandably be a traumatic situation for anyone.

My husband insists she is just 'manic bipolar', but this woman is almost perpetually in a manic state, has spent her entire retirement fund on silly trinkets from the dollar store and has forgotten how to use things she used to use daily, like a cell phone or a computer. Back her in heyday she was a highly functional woman who ran her own business and made almost $100,000 a year just by herself. I have to believe that at one point she must have been a very functional, powerful woman.

Right now she just paces around her kitchen everyday (she never sits) and scribbles illegible words on scraps of paper, shoving them into envelopes or taping them onto the wall. She took a permanent marker to the refrigerator one day and wrote a giant letter ""G"", saying that she ""Saw a G floating, and it compelled her to create it"". She's eating like a child would-- Oreo's, Marshmallow Peeps, and nachos... Her stomach is completely distended on her small frame and the doctor said it's because she's subjected herself to malnutrition.

She can't be still for more than a second. She moves repetitively back and forth, tapping her foot on her opposite ankle. She doesn't remember anything you told her to do (we always remind her to use the filtered fridge water instead of the well water from the tap, but she never remembers). She walks out of the house in her bare feet in the snow.

I just want to hear the opinions of some of you-- my own mother has worked in the mental health industry for over a decade (my mother-in-law did to some extent, as well) and she feels maybe this woman is dealing  with schizoaffective disorder, as it seems too extreme to be just bipolar disorder. Since her husband passed away she keeps thinking she hears footsteps throughout the house (she lives with her son, so is never truly alone) and she's so frantic all of the time.

I'm trying to convince my husband that his mother needs professional help, and that if we get her on the right medicine regime that there is STILL HOPE FOR HER! I think he feels some sort of guilt that is stopping him from really getting his mom the help she needs, and I can only intervene so much.

Thank you guys.","['dobj', 'compound']",-1,neu_vader

We did have to send him to the hospital once, because he wasn't taking any medicine at all, and wasn't eating at all. Now though he goes to the doctor's to get a shot every month, but doesn't let anybody go with him. 


We also used to receive phone calls from his old doctor asking him how he was doing and if anything is wrong. We don't receive anymore phone calls from him and we think that he may have changed the phone number on file, but again refuses to talk about it.


He does everything so secretively now. A while ago my mom found a letter in the mailbox from one of his old friends who is in prison, thanking him for sending him $200 (which we really don't have) and asking for another $200. He of course didn't tell anyone that he did this. 


If anybody tries to confront him about anything he just acts as if nothing happened and refuses to talk about anything



It is just an extreme loop of him acting extremely depressed one week, perfectly fine the next,  then acting really paranoid and then acting like an Ahole


I'm not really sure how to act around him anymore. I know he cares about us all, but he refuses to listen to anything anybody says. Please any advice would be greatly appreciated

Woke up. Then, while still in bed with my eyes closed(I don't think I was still dreaming because after I just got up), loud and clear as heck, ""Your God, he seeks you""

My God. Do I even have a God? I'm still shaking from hearing that. My God is my childhood abuser. That's my God. That's the guy that runs my 'verse. He seeks me? Does he want me to go to the other dimension? Did he find out his victims are calling to me?

From my browsing here you all seem like a solid resource and I'm hoping you can help me out. I'm going to offer as much relevant information as I can, apologies if anything comes off as ignorant or overly solipsistic. (I also apologize in advance for typos; it's late at night coming off a lengthy day.) I'm kind of scared right now and not at my best.

A couple weeks ago my therapist (whom I've only been seeing for a short time -- the past month or so) brought up a concern that I might be at risk for schizophrenia. I had approached her about anxiety issues (I have been diagnosed with major depression, an unspecified anxiety disorder, and panic disorder, although I think the last one is incorrect/inapplicable to my circumstances). Without getting into too much detail, the major sources of my anxiety, at least for the past few months, have had to do with government surveillance, some of it being factual and substantiated, some of it hypothetical and having to do with my being individually targeted. On that last point I emphasized to her that I do not necessarily believe that I am personally the object of a sinister, targeted campaign of some kind, only that I fear it. I recognize the the fear is probably unfounded, which is why I was seeking assistance from a therapist rather than the ACLU. She still seemed concerned, which alarmed me pretty deeply, as I felt (and mostly continue to feel) that my experiences have been typical of someone with, at most, moderate anxiety issues.

Potentially useful facts: I have never experienced hallucinations outside the ""normal"" range (eg. I'll frequently hear people calling my name when no one is, but I've been assured this is not indicative of mental illness, but a common experience for people generally). I DO always feel as if I am being watched (closer, actually, to something like scrutinized/studied). I don't know when this started but it's on the scale of years ago. Unless I am very immersed in what I'm doing, whether that's work or a social activity, I feel a perpetual nagging sense of unreality, something Plato's Cave/Matrix-y. Sometimes even if I am immersed. I am taking medication for anxiety and depression, and both conditions have improved greatly, possibly as a result of the meds or just from time/changes in circumstances. The closest (to my understanding) to a true psychotic experience is a semester early on in college when I became obsessed with a kind of supernatural threat and was perceiving a lot of benign things as taunting, menacing omens (the one that stands out to me most vividly was seeing a poster for the movie ""Drag Me to Hell"" on the sidewalk and believing that the poster was there to remind me of my imminent damnation). I had severe panic attacks that season. I was not raised religious. I am 25. People would describe/have described me as reserved and intelligent. I am not perceived as outgoing or affectionate, although I am generally seen as a kind/good person. I'm in a long-term romantic relationship which is going well.

A number of factors point away from me being at risk of schizophrenia. A. I have absolutely no family history of schizophrenia or of bipolar 1. There is a minor family history of bipolar 2, as well as a moderate family history of depression, anxiety disorders, and alcoholism. No family suicides, and to my knowledge no family members have required hospitalization for mental illness. B. I have no history of trauma or abuse, either as a child or as an adult. My childhood could have been a model for how to gird against developing serious mental issues. I was loved, nurtured, and supported. I grew up confident, with little to no issues with self-esteem or body image, even as a teen. Nobody close to me died until I was an adult. 3. I do not have a history of drug use; I drink on a fairly regular basis, though not to excess. I have smoked marijuana, but it's not a frequent thing.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis. What I would want ideally is some numerical indication of my risk/odds, but I'm certainly not expecting that from strangers on the Internet. ANY advice would be helpful, particularly if you've had experiences that are similar to mine. I sincerely appreciate your time and assistance.","['dobj', 'pobj']",-1,neu_vader

1. Hearing my name spoken or a noise in the next room, and then when I check for the source, there is none and so I realize it's just my imagination. Doesn't this happen to everyone sometimes?

2. Feeling bugs on me when they aren't really there, which I thought was normal when you have anxiety about bugs. And sometimes feeling phantom vibrations or a weird sensation in my spine that I can't describe.

3. Thinking that people are giving me weird looks, judging and talking about me. I chalked this one up to social anxiety. It happens when I'm near a group and can't quite catch all the words, just bits that sound like they are about me.

4. Thinking people have gone out of their way to harm me. I was bullied terribly so this one I told her straight up is not a delusion. She didn't sound convinced, but seriously, sometimes people DO.

5. Seeing things that aren't there. What really happens is, I look at something or someone, and it takes my brain a minute to realize that it isn't what I saw at first. For example, I was at the zoo and saw a girl walking and recognized myself (the way you would when you catch your refection in a mirror or see a pic of yourself that you've never seen before). Quickly I realized that was impossible, looked closer, and saw that it was a just a girl with similar features. I remember vaguely that right before I looked up and saw her, I was almost looking for myself. And sometimes I see a face or object out of the corner of my eye and when I look at it more closely it isn't there or is something else.

6. Being a hypochondriac (yeah, I used to be much worse)

7. Paranoia I used to feel about my partner cheating.

8. Getting caught up in weird what-if scenarios about aliens and space time dimensions and spiritual possibilities, and not being able to really believe that stuff i see on TV isn't based on really or could really happen to me, and getting upset and scared over it. I can get pretty ranty about this stuff when i don't remember that most people don't give a shit and would rather talk about what they had for dinner or who they have a crush on.


I'm diagnosed Bipolar 1 and BPD, and have been on Saphris, Abilify and Risperidol, but my doctor never said anything about them being for anything other than Bipolar. In fact, I didn't even know I was diagnosed BPD until I saw it on my records. Sometimes Doctors don't bother to tell you all your diagnoses because they don't want to upset you. Some of these things have lessened since I've been on the meds, but others are still there, and I didn't tell my doctor about most of it because all of it (except the hypochondria and fixation on weird scenarios) seemed normal.

I'd like to know if anyone has been diagnosed schizophrenic or Schizoaffective with symptoms this mild. Or if you don't even consider them mild.

I have not been there for while, but a doctor and a professor there continue to leak medical information. This is long story, and I do not want type it, but I have to start from the beginning. In class I had an instructor, I will call him Dr. A that I did not care for, but I was making the best of it. I went to hospital during the beginning of the semester, and when I returned to class I heard him make the comment ""He is not Schizophrenic"". It is not a concern of mine whether or not he thinks I am Schizophrenic, it is concern mine that he knows my diagnosis and speaking about liberally in front the class.
Latter, meaning a few weeks ago, I figure out that he was having communication with employees at the hospital, illegal communication with employees at hospital. Then this same person continues to call me fat and says I do not know how read. When I was in high school I weighed 165, I weigh 150 now. As far as reading is concerned I got a 167 on the verbal portion of GRE. I know a GRE exam does not prove I read any book in particular, but it does make the prospect of me not reading at all unlikely. Again the hazing aspect is not illegal, the sharing of information is, but I am unsure of how to proceed.

That was the first aspect of this, I also had doctor at the facility, who I did not see, who continues to people similar information. But they both seem to be neglecting the fact that if they were no talking about me being Schizophrenic, no would think I was, not very many people know and this would be non- issue. Another, professor, admittedly more kind, asked me if something wrong and I avoided telling him. Not out of rudeness, but because I did want to get him in trouble. One of them said I was using people sympathy, but if stopped talking about my medical illness no one being feeling sympathetic about anything.

Then today, after I talked to friend, who I am not sure is friend to be perfectly honest, I heard my neighbors talking about things that were particularly sensitive. It included the normal things people say about not being able to read and other he threatened to pull gun me. I am in a Southern state and I should have expected this, but it still unpleasant and unnecessary.

I also think someone is monitoring my internet activity. I keep my computer on and have it run fake goggle searches, and I hear people talking about the things it automatically searches. I think the people outside want to hurt me, and only go outside to take care of my dog. 
Everyone everywhere keeps talking about me and I have been inside my house for nearly 6 months and they keep complaining that Im bothering them. 

I need a method to kill myself, nothing is going to changer. I do not have enough of my medication to do it because I've been taking and it is whittling down to an insignificant amount. No one tells me what going on and I think there hurting me intentionally.

Again to return to the actual legal issue, people are saying things about me that are untrue and they things about me they should not know. I even had someone call me anti-Semetic for god knows what reason. The instructor I mentioned that was civil toward me was Jewish, and I have never said anything indicate such a prejudice. I am black by the way, and have always found Anti-Semtism disgusting. I could never imagine someone who hate Jews finding black people swell.

I don't understand, these rumors keep getting recycled over and over to point were it effecting my life, and even my medical care because my current doctors are aware of this nonsense and effecting way that they evaluate me. I am not sure what to due about both personal and the legal situation. It is something I am not equipped to handle, and due to nature of my diagnosis I am not reliable in every way. However, since they seem to know this they are exploiting that fact. Right now I am not Schizophrenic to them, but if complain goes through I will for polemical purposes become schizophrenic and therefore not cognitively capable of understanding what is happening to me.

I hear people talking about all the time, and since I take an injection for medication I am sure that great deal of what I am hearing is what people are actually saying. One person think I know who Albert Camus is because of Midnight in Paris. This neglects the fact that Camus is Algerian and none his novels are set in Paris. Also he would have been 7 when the movie took place. I know I am nitpicking , but in conjunction the actual legal infractions that continues to take place, it is overwhelming me. If this events were occurring in isolation I think I could deal with them, but it is effecting my actual medical care. The medical breaches, the rumors, the lies, and the half truths have made so that I hear people talking about me everywhere I go. I hear them in addition the voices in hear in my head.

My reason: I am 17 now, 3-4 years ago I suddenly had an onset of delusions that started off quite 'minor' then increased in depth, Firstly, I believed I knew someone named Matt and where he lived ( which I found untrue when I knocked on this believed house), to then quite rapidly to believing entities from an alternate universe would follow me everywhere, I would skip school and sit in a park each day for like 7 hours and converse with them (this was supported by vivid hallucinations etc) After months I then went on anti-depressants and that belief vanished, I then went on antipsychotics as my mind was scattered. 
Then I went off both meds and soon had another- scarier belief. I believed that these entities were back but now they could see through my eyes and control/help me, and were greater in number.They could watch, follow, and talk to me whenever too, they were both good and hurtful 'evil' (again supported my hallucinations, with touch and hearing but never more vivid). But most prominent was the fact that I could visit different worlds in my sleep ( supported by intense sensory like hearing and touch, ability to walk around - and my vision of 'alien' landscapes and life). 
Now: At present I am gradually detaching from this reality of mine because it started to frighten me deeply, and I became attached 'too much' to these entities, by welcoming them freely. but I frequently do believe I CAN make contact with different races (although not willingly) because I still frequently have the very vivid 'dreams', where I'd sometimes remember 3 or 4 upon waking , my experience's are my proof.........
I gradually feel at ease with this, sometimes believing ,sometimes not, but I just carry on
(What makes me question the realty is from taking meds that vanished past beliefs)

This is my first time posting here and I'd like to ask you all for your input. I'm writing a book in which one of the main characters has schizophrenia. She experiences her first psychotic episode at the age of 35 (I know they typically happen earlier) and is facing some very difficult consequences of her diagnosis. The book itself is fantasy noir set in the year 2016 and this woman is a highly-trained agent for an ancient organization that has set itself up to protect the rest of humanity against monsters. 

If I put up links to the chapters that detail her personality, her diagnosis, and her first episode would you folks be willing to look it over and offer critiques? I want what she's going through to be realistic and accurate, down to the medication she takes and the way her illness affects her personality and views on the world.  She's the strongest character in the book and will end up saving the day and being the heroine of the story, and I'd like her journey to reflect that she's very much a real and capable person worthy of respect.

Thank you!

In April my brother experienced his first psychotic episode involving paranoid delusions (he drove about 8 hours away in the middle of the night thinking that people were after him). Anyway, he is now on seroquel and effexor. He has been OK for the most part. Sometimes he would ask me if I could read his mind and do ESP tests.

Anyway, today his gf of 11 years (whom he lived with) broke up with him. He was always thinking she was hiding things from her and he would take out all of his anger on her. He moved back home today. For the most part he has not been outwardly emotional whatsoever. At one point he said he forgot his meds at his gfs house and needed to go back. After he left we tried to contact the GF to make sure she knew. He got there and she wasn't home, but he saw that we called on the caller ID. he then called my mother to say he doesn't trust us now. After that he lingered there for a few hours and seemed agitated  and angry when we called to see where he was. The GF would not go home this whole time as she was scared of his anger and paranoia. Eventually he came home and seemed really sad and defeated, saying ""forget what I said, you can talk to her and be nice."" He then went to bed.

The GF wants us to get her house key from him tomorrow and she wants their dog too. I'm scared this is going to be a huge blow for him- she was his main support system. How can I help him? I don't know how to make him trust us, I'm not sure that he can. I don't want him to become even more paranoid and depressed. The whole situation is really heartbreaking.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

Ok, so I'm 17, almost 18, male. I had a fairly traumatic childhood. My dad drowned when I was three. This left my mom unstable/depressed for quite some time. I was depressed, although never diagnosed. I was also insecure about myself, and bullied regularly until 4th grade, where the bullying/social rejection begain to go away, and by 6th or 8th grade I had several close friends, and many regular friends. It has continued on like that until this day (honestly, I'm fairly normal. Grades aren't bad, I'm socially awkward, but haven't had too much trouble making friends/socializing in recent years). Although I still suffer some minor depression here and there over my dad. 

Also when I was young, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I was medicated on several different drugs through the years, and am currently on vyvanse. 

I realize that I can be paranoid. It shows in things like I feel like I'm being mocked, or that I'm being unfairly criticized/blamed for whatever issue. I also tend to be a major hypochondriac. 

So in short, major symptoms I show are 
*paranoia to a degree
*I tend to go off on tangents/have disorganized or unassociated thoughts
*I tend to be forgetful
*insomnia, although this could be due to my ADHD medication
*I read somewhere that ""movement is sped up. i.e. constantly pacing"" was a possible sign. And I pace **all the time**
*hypersensitivity to critcism/insults
*sudden anger/instability/hostility. I have always blamed this on the loss of my dad though. It used to be much worse, although I have learned to deal with it and though may still get heated about something, I can usually keep it controlled. 
*anxiety
*feeling people are talking about you. 

Also, I recently found out my grandmother has suffered from paranoid schizophrenia since she was 19, although she hasn't had and ""episode"" since I was 5 or so. It's not very noticeable in her anymore

Its also worth noting that I have had many of these symptoms since I was young, and no one has ever expressed concern that I could be schizophrenic and I haven't heard any voices/ seen anything. 

So could I be at a very high risk/devel schizophrenia or are my symptoms just the result of bad ADHD, the results of dealing with my fathers death, and generally being a hypochondriac?

I slept very badly and very little and this caused me to have -amongst other things- hallucinations a lot of the time. I also got on my period again and the mental and physical exhaustion got me to stay sick at home for a few days.

Now I'm a week off the meds and I feel great. Everything is going perfectly. Last week I actually walked on a rainbow (okay, it was a hallucination, but it goes to show how I'm feeling) and this week has been even better so far. I feel like everything's made to make me feel good and I feel fantastic. My hallucinations have been better and my delusions of being all alone have crept to the background. 

I finally get to do stuff again. I got my roses a new pot because they've outgrown their way too small one. I'm working on the house. I've got my garden finished. I've got tons of ideas of things to draw and build in 3D that I never got time or inspiration for until about 6 months ago. I have trouble sleeping, again.

I know I might soon fall into sadness and bad hallucinations again, but for now, I'm glad I'm not on any meds. Everything is perfect. Even the thoughtbringers in my head are at peace with my constant high.

He became director of publications at Harvard Medical School. He discusses some of the pitfalls of administering antipsychotics for schizophrenia. 

He warns, however, these studies are looking at aggregates. Individuals respond differently to treatment. So don't be disheartened. Medication does work for some people, but in the long term his studies found at the aggregate people do better off. There are serious side effects to antipsychotics, like high blood pressure, that can lead to early death, etc., and evidence of brain shrinkage. 

I think at an individual level we have to weigh the benefits with the costs of antipsychotics. Everyone is different...but this video definitively brings ups concerns to me. What are psychiatrists not warning me about? Why do some studies not receive funding after their results are known to show not promising results from antipsychotics? Why is there few research on people off antipsychotics or alternative methods?

I've asked for help before. I've naturally never been really open about myself, concealing nearly every fact about my life. I'm not sure why. When I first asked for help, and every subsequent time, I only release barebones details. I don't go into depth about every issue that I think I might have and try to get the best help possible.

This 'cycle' has lasted for over 2 months. In the beginning I convinced myself that I didn't need my meds anymore, that I didn't need to see the doctor anymore, and that I was fine. I slowly took myself off my meds without my parent's knowledge, and then flat out refused to visit the psychiatrist / therapist. I've kept up so far, but for the past few weeks I have noticed myself getting much worse. Depression, anxiety, psychosis, paranoia, everything is there, even on the meds. It's very muted though. Since going off my meds they have all severely increased in intensity, to the point where I am literally tearing my room apart for bugs, sitting up all night because of hallucinations, and having terrible dreams causing me to wake every 30 minutes.

I have been able to maintain that I am doing fine, and that I don't need help. My family is none the wiser. I don't know how to admit to them that I need help, AGAIN. I don't know how to swallow my pride and admit that I fucked up. I don't even know what I'd do after I told them I needed help.

I ended up being held hostage from Undercover officers on ladders coming up to my second story window.  They had my whole place surrounded.  To make matters worse I was high on a lot of 4fa butt naked looking at porn.  Really embarrassing I know!  I threw my stash of 4fa down the toilet (Still naked during this time) Its technically not scheduled but I didnt want to take the chance of the analogue act seeing as I had over 10 grams. This was the only drugs I had in my apartment at the time.  They sat at my window for 12 hours while I held my hands in the air.  I eventually passed out after the sun went down.

I woke up the next morning confused as fuck.  I thought the people that held me hostage were my neighbors as I couldn't remember to much because of how high I was.  Then I noticed a unusual looking van in the back of the complex right next to the dumpster.  I looked up the model number on Google and it took me right to the manufactures website.  It was a surveillance vehicle.  The building I lived in was really old and you could here everything from other peoples apartments.  I stayed up for two weeks listening to the undercover officers talk at night while I acted like I was asleep.  I called an old friend who I haven't talked to in 10 years who is a lawyer.  He called my building and got the number of the lead detective.  A few days later he showed up and busted the whole operation.  

They cleared out a whole bunch of equipment that night but unfortunately moved right back in the next day.  My lawyer convinced the apartment complex to immediately let me out of my lease and I got the hell of there in about a month.

The night my lawyer busted the operation was quite the scene.  My lawyer actually showed up with police officers.  At the time I still thought my neighbors were in on it as I remember a few of them at some of my windows.  They ended up raiding three of my neighbors apartments and hauling them off to jail.  The whole time this was happening my lawyer and the lead detective where in the courtyard in a screaming match.  I thought for sure I was going to jail for something and had a complete mental break down.

It got so bad after a few weeks. I just left work without anyone knowing and went to my doctors office thats part of the hospital downtown.  He found my in my room crying and talking to imaginary people.  I was completely out of my mind and he had a nurse walk me over to the er where I was hospitalized for about 5 days. 

The doctor at the hospital diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and said I was having a manic episode.  I was put on Alonzapine and starting seeing a therapist and psychologist.  The voices would not go away completely even while I was on 30mg a day.  

I did my best and quit doing drugs. I have screwed up  a few times here and there but Im trying.  For the past 2 years I have been hearing voices and extremely paranoid. Its been a pretty rough ride.  There are 4 voices that I constantly hear.  When its been bad I have actually had full on conversations with them. There is always one girl that usually sticks up for me and they argue with each other a lot. I always feel like Im being watched and spied on. It even got to the point about 8 months ago I started taking vents apart in my condo looking for bugs.  I have also thought that the voices could read my text messages so I would start to have conversations with them by texting myself. I have been hospitalized twice in the last 2 years and almost a third time about 3 months ago but they let me leave the hospital that time as I told them I had an anxiety attack.  Sometimes I think they are at my work.  The voices always come from the ceiling.

For the last six months I have been on risperidone.  This actually helped a ton more than the alonzapine.  After about 3 months it it stopped working which was when I was almost hospitalized for the third time.  My new knew psychiatrist decided to up the risperidone and add haldol as well.  Since this the voices and paranoia have finally gone away. 

Unfortunately I just got in lot of trouble at work and am on probation.  The anti psychotics made me so tired I was falling asleep at work.  People started complaining how weird I was acting and zoning off into space and not talking to anyone.  I decided I needed a break from them as everyone around kept saying how different I was and zoned out.  Although my psychologist is not that happy that I quit taking them he made me promise that I have to start taking them as soon as I have any psychotic symptoms. 

The good news is I have a incredibly supportive family and girlfriend (now fiance) as of 3 weeks ago.  We have been together for 9 years but we were broken up for a few months when I was under investigation.  I now own a beautiful condo, things are going much better at work, and will be getting married next fall.  My parents don't live in the city but are about 5 hours drive away and have come up several times when things have gotten out of hand to help me.  My fiance is a nurse and she is keeping an eye on me.  She is not happy I stopped the anti psychotics but knows how much they were affecting me with side effects. We haven't been able to have sex in the last year because of them. I have meds on hand if any of the symptoms start coming back and will take them.  This is the first time I have been completely back to normal.

Both of the psychologists that I have scene outside the hospital wont give me a diagnoses just yet.  My knew one told me we can talk about that later and the important thing is to get me stabilized first.  He said between Bipolar, schizo-affective, and Schizophrenia are all treated with the same medication.

I don't get the highs and lows that come with being Bi-polar so I don't know whats really going on.  I also have extreme anxiety problems and am allowed .5mg of Xanax three times a day.  This has been a life savor for me.  I also just started effexor a few weeks ago for the anxiety so I don't have to take so much Xanax.

Thoughts?

Off meds. I'm off meds. My doctor didn't give me anything for in the mean time while they figure out the situation with my insurance not paying for my monthly injection anymore.

Keep hearing voices. I'm a God. I'm supposed to save them, slay the devil. 

Ugh. I'm not going into this fucked up delusional state again. I'm just not going to deal with it. The voices are getting more frequent, clearer.

And I swear I'm dong my best to be calm and act like nothing is happening but they persist. 

It's like I'm trying to stay out of psychosis but do I even have a choice anymore? Yea, I ""know"" I'm not a God, I'm not their savior, I'm not meant to go to some other dimension. But the doubts are creeping up on me. The thoughts once again that I *might* be more than I am in this dimension. 

I can't stand this. I want my meds back NOW. I want to go back to how I was last week. I don't want this headache of voices and urges to cut and delusions of grandeur and end up being hospitalized. 

I can't believe this is happening again. I'm just so frustrated. Why the heck didn't my doctor give me something to take so I don't lose my shit? 

I'm creeped out, getting creepy scary ""save me"" messages from all these people in another dimension and it leaves me so conflicted. 

I hear them again and it just makes me ""know"" that they exist. That I've just been taking medicine to make my ability to hear them disabled. 

My head is going for a spin and I don't like it. I'm going to call my doctor on Monday, which is all I can do at this point. But this sucks. I feel myself slipping and I easily picture myself going back to old ways, being far gone as fuck like I was just 4 months ago. 

That was a terrifying, dark place, and I don't want to go back to that nightmare of hearing voices loudly every fucking second and believing them and planning my trip to the other dimension. Fuck that. I have a decent life here, slowly I'm making progress and doing things to benefit my life in this dimension.

And here come the fucking voices thinking they can start where they left off with their stupid story of woe and how I have to save them from demons. How I'm the only one. How I have to leave my friends and my family and my life here and kill myself to save them. 

No No No No NO. They're in my head and in my home and they haven't the right. 

I really have been trying to be calm all day. Just forget that I'm off meds, forget that I've heard voices in the past. Just focus on the present, do some cooking and drawing and look up recipes I want to make later. But you know what? All fucking day it's been whisper whisper goddamn whisper. I want to think I can ignore it and it'll go away, as if I had some freaking control over it, but I don't. I truly don't. They start and stop when they please. 

My mind is filled with worry again. These people are telling me I'm more than just one person here. I'm more than anything I've ever been. I'm a savior. A God. And I'm worried. I'm concerned for them. But more-so, I'm concerned about getting too deep into this thing. 

I remind myself that they are just apart of my disease. That in REALITY, they are apart of my own mind. In reality, they are me, not individual people, not in some alternate universe. They're nothing more than my mind and its illness. 

It's all conflicting stuff, ya know? One hand, I know they're not real, I know I need meds, I know I have this disease and from the experience of time and time again stopping my meds, they always come back, so I know I have this disease. On another hand, I can easily believe them if I let my guard down a little. Trust me. It gets BAD. If I start to accept anything they say I'll go into a full blown psychotic state where I'm trying to jump off buildings and into portals to other dimensions and slit my wrist to damage a demon because we're connected. 

Fuck all that. I just want to be medicated and healthy like I was earlier this week, before my meds were cut off. 

Blahhh. I just needed to vent because no one around me understands. No one can. They don't get how scared I am or how serious this feels or how I just want to cry because I don't want to go through all the nightmares again. I am so traumatized by my experiences with schizophrenia. I want to be medicated for the rest of my life, I just don't want anymore delusions, confusion about reality or voices. I just want some peace. I need some fucking peace. I had it since I started getting the shot of medication but now I feel like I'm all messed up.

I love her and want to help her, and I will not stop encouraging her to share what she feels with the doctors. But when she is paranoid, she thinks the doctors would just deny her truth and give her meds to suppress it.

My question is: is listening to her talking about her paranoid delusions and her theories as to why the conspiracy is happening to her, in a way, ""enabling"" her to keep thinking this way?

I'm tired of missing school, and I'm tired of somewhat reduced concentration while on this medication (not sure whether it's due to the illness or the medication, though), so I want to try Abilify, which I heard doesn't cause sedation in most cases and increases cognitive abilities such as concentration and overall academic achievement, at least based on the case study I've read.


I asked my doctor to switch to Abilify, to which he responded negatively, because ""I'm doing really well with Amisulpride and I have no idea what will happen if we switch to Abilify"". I understand that he may be cautious, but at this point, the disability caused by having to sleep at least 12-14 (sometimes more) hours a day to be able to function is even more severe than the possible risks which switching to Abilify could bring up. I miss lots of classes, can't do my homework on time (because I sleep all the time) and have reduced personal time due to the sedation caused by this medication.

I finished high school in 2012, and for the year following experimented with weed, mushrooms, 2c-b, MDMA and on one occasion opium.

I just want my friend back he doesn't open up like he used to. I can't think of another way to approach him or if I should. I'd love some advice guys.

Basically, instead of waking up in the morning looking forward to the rest of the day, I wake up trying to think of what I can possibly do to pass the time for another 12 hours. It's boredom, but without the desire to do anything.

I brought this up to my psychiatrist and she said that as long as I can find occasional enjoyment -- that is to say as long as I am not completely anhedonic -- it isn't something she is concerned with. It is, however, something that _I_ am concerned with.

I am almost certain it is the medication that is the culprit because I stopped taking my medication for a while, and after several weeks I was able to enjoy things as I used to. Unfortunately, this landed me in the hospital again.

Has anyone else experienced this? If you don't mind me asking, which medications did you experience this with, and have you found a third option -- one that doesn't involve perpetual boredom or going to the hospital? Help is greatly appreciated, thank you!","['dobj', 'pobj']",-1,neu_vader

I think either he or my landlord is hiring private detectives or has friends or something to follow me. I walk from one 'home' to another 'home' during the darkest part of the night to hide myself but I keep noticing cars trailing behind me so I duck into the woods and find a nice spot to camp out for the night to hide from them.

*~*~*~*~ Edit for some clarity and more objective ways to describe what I am going through.~*~*~*~

I'm going to use this http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/192361.php to say what I don't from there.  And at the moment it is only the being unaware part that doesn't fit me. I understand there are no hard fast diagnosis in mental health but I think its a decent place to start without having to try to decipher my ramblings.

In terms of the bipolar portion, I saw this in the side bar 
(D. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness) 
I'm not entirely sure if I have ever had a truly manic phase or if those were just breaks in the depression that I do swing in to. I did have some of these symptoms during the last major depressive cycle. If I were to say I were in a depressive cycle at the moment then I'd have to comment that these newer ( or atleast strengthening symptoms ) are overshadowing it in large part.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader

I had a childhood friend who was always pretty wierd. She never really had any friends. She mostly played alone, besides when I played with her (which I did do pretty often, I had a huge crush on her). She moved schools in middle school, and I haven't seen her since. Fast forward to Tuesday, I saw her on Facebook,many judging by her pictures, I was 100% certain it was her. I added her, chatted, and we hit it off instantly. 

Anyways, back to the actual question- the other day, she told me 2 things that really shocked me,mine wayyy more than the other.
1) she's schizophrenic
2) the thing that shocked me the most- she's a satinist (I think the correct spelling). She worships Satin. 

I don't want to leave her as we both have many similar interests and things in common, but I want to help her. First off, right at the bat, she told me she's satinist because of the fact that she's schizophrenic- she's hears voices and have hallucinations (100% sure. She was diagnosed as a child) and she feel these visions are the reason that she worships Satin. 


The main issue I'm having is that she told me she stopped taking her meds, almost a year ago.

Sorry this is all over the place, and semi-venting, but one, what are some long term effects of not taking her meds? Can she go crazy? 
And two, is there any way I can help her? What so you suggest? 
Sorry for the long question and thanks in advanced for any advice you can give me.

Once my psychosis resolved, these kinds of ideas went away.

So here's the deal. I work as and EMT in a medium sized city, and I deal with mental health calls on a regular basis. Most of these can be attributed to depression, or drug induced psychosis, but once in a blue moon, I get a patient who is having an active psychotic episode. I have done well over the past few years in learning how to not escalate situations, but I have been wondering if what I am doing is for the best.


Let me explain with an example. A few weeks ago I brought in a patient who had shown up for a mental health appointment, and had began talking about how the ""Horse heads"" were out to get them. The doctors called 911, and we show up. The patient was willing to go, partly because they realized they were out of medication, but was very apprehensive about my partner and myself. So, like I have done in the past, I played into the fantasy, and stated that my partner and I were Horsehead Fighters, and that my ambulance was a safe zone. This worked out pretty well, and our patient came outside, sat on the gurney, and we had a very calm ride to the hospital, with me continuing to listen, and play my part if things began to get out of control.


My question is this, because I don't get a lot(Any) of follow up with any of my patients, is this an okay way of dealing with someone having an episode? Is there a better way of trying to help someone who doesn't want to go, even if they need it? Part of me feels bad that I am straight up lying to someone, but I can justify that with the mentality that it gets them help. But what I don't know is if someone would remember that, and if that would mess with their continued care plan, or worse, make someone more apprehensive if they ever have another break.

Back and fourth and back and fourth... so this is less about stress and life though, its more about gathering information, understanding, expanding knowledge to better understand the self. So lets begin, about 3 months ago, I kinda broke, wide open, like a shell that had been covering me cracked open and instead of seeing a world filtered by a lens, everything was raw and new. For four months before this, I had been dealing with Heavy stress and anxiety, At work, i was stealth, this term meaning, i am Transgender, MtF, but i pass well enough in my desired gender role to not have to let anyone know that, if i do not want them to, someone found out, from what ever reasons or notions, it was probably due to my getting heated in an argument on LGBT rights with them. He used this knowledge, before i knew he knew, in the next argument we had, as a trump card, as a way of getting under my skin, it was terrible, i am Normally very paranoid, i need no reason to feel like someone doesn't like me, or is talking about me behind my back, but having a good reason to feel that way made everything so much worse. He told a handful of like minded people, or I'd assume they were if i knew who he told. Just him using it against me like that in an argument led me to having a panic attack and breaking down. I had to hide myself in the rest room, trying to talk myself through things, crying, panicking, anxious out of my skull. I know he told people, because friends of mine started to bring it to my attention, the Few people i had trusted with this knowledge gave me heads up of a handful of people, but who ever else knew? my managers, my co-workers, retail is hard enough on its own without added stress. I couldn't go into work without feeling like everyone was staring at me, looking at me, dirty looks, looks of disgust, hate, loathing, for what, these people who barely knew me, who i worked beside for months and months already. These sensations of dread and paranoia didn't seem like enough punishment i suppose. I ended up finding that i couldn't be in the same room as my tormentor, i had not said a word to him, i had not had him speak to me once sense our last fight, but seeing him, a boy i had felt for, been friends with, trusted somewhat, had cared about, someone who had even at times stuck up for me, seeing what he had done, just seeing him, or knowing he was close by, sense sensations of pain through my chest, it felt like my heart was crying almost, everything became strange, and dream like. I spoke to management, it was a slow process, the manager i spoke with was not doing his job, so i spoke to another, she got the ball rolling, the Store Manager was very angry that his shift manager had not told him of a harassment case, a red-book investigation was opened up. But the first manager went on LOA (Leave of Absence) and has still to now not returned and from what i hear this cannot finish until he does. So for 4 months i endured panicked night after night, stress, anxiety, fear of losing my job, my mind, everyone i cared about at the store. Some didn't know, but some did, i still don't know who does. just constant paranoia, Finally after 4 months i was zoning front clothing tables one night, it was a very bad night, i had no medical coverage, i had no medication for anxiety, or anything, i lived a normally very stressful life to this point, and finally after years of stress, after the 4 months of panic attacks, paranoia, and fear, i broke, everything shifted, instead of worrying people were looking at me, they were looking at me, people talking about me out of the corner of my hearing, colors and hues changed in my vision, light, sound everything was being filtered back to me far stronger than it was, even for my normally photosensitive eyes, I'd see him, in everyone, always afaird he would walk out in front of me, he would turn his head to me each time i saw him, or i'd look up in his direction and he would be staring at me... the fear, the panic was different, at this point i was familiar with panic, but these sensations, this shaking in my limbs, all the sounds coming to me as strongly as if they were being spoken to me, something i had to listen to, the air conditions over head, the trucks outside, the registers beeping incessantly with each item rung up. It was all too much. It didn't stop though, even after the last 3 hours of a long night, it didn't stop when i left, it didn't stop when i got to the car, finally able to cry to myself there, and when i lit up my cigaret it didn't stop, i got home, and sat in a corner of my room, just wanting everything to stop. finally my body too tired to continue was able to get to sleep, a handful of melatonin pills helped with that. When i woke up everything was a little off kilter, not like before, but i was having an immensely hard time feeling anything which is all together odd for me, it wasn't like the waking dream states of dissociation i had been having before. I had done Acid, about 3 months into the 4 months of heavy stress, and panic, because i was finally at the point were i wanted to experience things in life before my waning candle flame was snuffed short. and while on acid i had met my significant other, a force in my life that gave me back a lot of hope for a future. But the trip hit me a little differently that the others. It was my first time and i had done 4 tabs of what was apparently i the words of my more experienced friends, Very good stuff. i don't know if that would have had a bearing, looking back i have had a lot of minor symptoms, predispositions towards this for a very long time, i dont know even now though if i have Schizophrenia or not, after that night at work though, things got weird, a paranoid delusion, i get, i can even serperate it, but now sounds scared me, i herd voices now and then, Do it do it, a male voice would say to me, while i was totally calm, no fear, no triggers, just laying in bed with my girl friend, a woman's voice would call my name some nights on the register, or while i was driving. i would see shadows move, objects move when i know they shouldn't. Panic attacks, ex stream stress, i already knew these things can cause hallucinations  but to have them in moments of celerity and calm... that scared me. So here i am, posting this here, probably far to long a message. I have been having hallucinations, for 3 moths now, just now and then, not all the time, but they no longer have major triggers, they just happen, sure when i am at work, panicked they can happen, but not always like this, they are like the old ones, but sometimes at work it is also the new ones, mixing together, feeding off eachother. I dont know if this is what i have or not, and i am working on getting on the company medical plan so i can seek therapy, to find out more. But yeah, thats my story so far.",['dobj'],-1,neu_vader
